Jorja Fox has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: ER (1994), The West Wing (1999) and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000).

As a teenager, Fox had a career as a fashion model. She then turned to formal study of the acting craft at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York, as well as under the tutelage of veteran actor William Hickey at HB Studios.

After appearing in several minor films and TV series, Fox got her big break in 1996 by landing a role in the immensely successful ER (1994) TV series. She appeared in 33 episodes as "Dr. Maggie Doyle" who became embroiled in a sexual harassment suit against a powerful hospital administrator. Fox then got a recurring role in the renowned The West Wing (1999) TV series where she portrayed a Secret Service agent who was in charge of protecting the President's college-age daughter. She had a key role in that series' cliffhanger episode where the President's entourage comes under gunfire by assassins.

Fox appeared as part of the regular cast of the popular TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) where she portrayed one of the crime scene investigators as a regular until 2008. She was a guest star of the show in 2009, recurred in 2010, and returned as a regular from 2011 to the present. Fox shared in CSI's 2005 Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series.

In addition to her TV and movie roles, Fox is the co-founder of an experimental stage theater production company called "Honeypot Productions". Fox is also a musician and songwriter. She wrote and performed the song "Lullabye" which was featured in the movie Traveling Companion (1998)), as well as co-producing a musical about Dusty Springfield in Los Angeles called "Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield" in 2008. In 2010, she produced a feature documentary called "How I Became An Elephant."
