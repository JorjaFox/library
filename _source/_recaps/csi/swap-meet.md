## Quotes

**Sanders** Hot shoes.  
**Sidle** You think these are sexy, huh?  
**Sanders** _(shrugs)_  
**Sidle** Did you know that shoes like these put degenerative stress on the hip joints, throw off the curve of the spine, and the tilt to the pelvis, over time, women get headaches, sore backs, shortened calf muscles and bunions, of course. _stands up_  
**Sanders** I take it back.

**Grissom** You think it was a crime of passion?  
**Sidle** _(nods)_ Yeah. When you have to go outside a marriage for passion, you're in trouble. And you're asking for trouble.  
**Grissom** _(looks over at Bradys)_ Well, they say they're happily married.  
**Sidle** You think they're happy?
