## Synopsis

Two cases get very personal for Grissom and Catherine in this pivotal episode. In the first, Grissom discovers that the murders of a party guest at a nightclub and a man who was working out in his apartment are related. The deaths were similar and both victims were employees of Lady Heather, a dominatrix who penetrates Grissom's cold exterior to reveal his vulnerability. The second case involves Catherine's ex-husband, Eddie, who vanishes after his car crashes while he's traveling with their daughter. Sara leads the investigation, but Catherine quickly becomes displeased with the way it's being handled.

_Note: This episode was 90 minutes.

## Sara Sidle Review

Sara handles her job competently, not hesitating to get into Catherine's face and telling her to back off. At the end she accepts that with the limited evidence they have, they will never really know exactly what happened in the accident.

## Character Notes

* Sara doesn't hesitate to tell Catherine to back off the case.  
* Sara doesn't want to talk about Hank, or at least she doesn't want to say if Hank takes her anywhere.

**Sidle:** What the hell are you doing? Do you know where you're at right now?  
**Willows:** I've been here a lot longer than you ...  
**Sidle:** And you should know better.  
**Willows:** And I wouldn't have to be here if you were doing your job properly.  
**Sidle:** There is a difference between me doing my job and you wanting to do it for me. You don't want to get the job done. What you want, right now, is revenge.  
**Willows:** You're going to tell me what I want, huh?  
**Sidle:** Go home, Catherine. Be with your daughter. She's the one that needs you. _Sara walks away from Catherine_
