## Synopsis

Grissom, Warrick, and Nick investigate the case of man who apparently was murdered and pushed off a six story building. Grissom's involvement is cut short by renewed hearing problems. Catherine looks into the murder of man outside of his regular bar.

## Sara Sidle Review

Sara only appears in the scene quoted below, having maxed out on her overtime and is not permitted in the field for a while.

## Character Notes

* Sara doesn't consider Hank her boyfriend.  
* Catherine does not back Sara up when it comes to policy or Grissom (see also "Nesting Dolls").  
* Sara once again shows her phobia of germs in public places.

## Quotes

**Sidle:** _(cough to get Willows' attention)_ Can you help me out?  
**Willows:** Ahh ... Depends.  
**Sidle:** I can't get out into the field becuase I'm maxed out on overtime for the month.  
**Willows:** Ah and you're confined to the lab, huh? Well hey, look, it's regular hours. I mean go have dinner with the boyfriend. _(pause)_ Hank. Right? And, and go to a spa.  
**Sidle:** Hank is not my boyfriend. And you know, those places are filled with bacteria.  
**Willows:** Sara, I don't make the rules around here. You gotta talk to Grissom about that.  
**Sidle:** Yeah. Um. He's, um, not really in the talking mood.  
**Willows:** What makes you think he's gonna talk to me?  
**Sidle:** _(shrugs)_  
**Willows:** Get some rest.  
**Sidle:** I'm not tired! Really! I'm not tired.
