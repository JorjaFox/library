Questions here are about Jorja Fox's personal life and, in broad terms, her career, including how to get in touch with her.

## Who is Jorja Fox?

Jorja Fox is an actor, producer, activist and musician.

She is most well known for her TV work, having played the recurring role of Dr. Maggie Doyle on the NBC show ER from 10/10/1996 through 01/21/1999, the guest role of Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on NBC's The West Wing from 02/24/2000 through 09/2000, and the regular role of Sara Sidle on CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

She has also been seen in movies and award shows, and is an environmentalist and humanitarian who attends many outreach causes. For her other roles, see her filmography. For more about her background, read her biography.

## What's the deal with her name?

This question arises since Jorja Fox was listed as 'Jorjan Fox' in her first few movies, on Missing Persons, and on her first few episodes of ER. After a few episodes, her listing changed to 'Jorja Fox'. The confusion was compounded by the following rumor "When [Jorja] joined the cast of ER, her name was shortened back to Jorja after a couple episodes, hence the confusion. In an interview she said that one day she woke up and wanted her name back."

The rumor is arguable, and not verifiable. The truth of the matter is that her birth name is 'Jorja-An' and Jorja is a shortening. Jorjan was bastardization of Jorja-An that was done when she was on Missing Persons.

Today, both personally and professionally, she is known as 'Jorja Fox'.

## Is Jorja Fox single? Is she dating?

In 2001, Jorja told USA Today she was seeing someone: "Involved, but not married. I'm not allowed to talk about it at all. I've been sworn to secrecy -- the whole theory that it's more special. I'm very happy and living under a shroud until further notice."

However in a 2003 interview with People Magazine, she was reported as being single, and that was why she took her brother to the Emmys that year.

At various times she has had songs that she has written and played on her personal web site.
