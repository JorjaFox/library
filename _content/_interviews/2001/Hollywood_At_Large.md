In 2001, Court TV had a new show, Hollywood at Large, in which they look into various TV shows and how they portray the criminal justice system. CSI was featured in the pilot, on Feb 23, 2001.

Jorja Fox had a brief interview on the show (the CSI scene lasted for about five minutes). In her interview she stated that she has liked forensic TV shows (like 'The New Detectives') since before she started working on CSI, and that she still gets grossed out the easiest.
