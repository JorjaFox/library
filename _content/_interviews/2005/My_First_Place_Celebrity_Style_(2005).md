HGTV, in a interesting move, released excerpts from it's new show "'My First Place: Celebrity Style"' online.

Jorja Fox was filmed for an upcoming episode and her quote on the main page is as follows:

> I was a bad teenager. I had to get out of there. My family was very old-fashioned and I knew quite young that I needed to get my own place. I was 16. I moved in with my friends.
