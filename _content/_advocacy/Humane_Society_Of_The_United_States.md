The Humane Society of the United States is the nation's largest and most effective animal protection organization -- backed by 11 million Americans, or one in every 28. Established in 1954, The HSUS seeks a humane and sustainable world for all animals -- a world that will also benefit people. We are America's mainstream force against cruelty, exploitation and neglect, as well as the most trusted voice extolling the human-animal bond.

Jorja has attended multiple events for the Humane Society, and in 2010 was given an Animal Advocate Award.
