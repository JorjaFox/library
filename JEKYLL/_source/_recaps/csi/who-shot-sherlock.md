## Synopsis

Greg, for his final proficiency, has to determine how the Sherlock Holmes of a Sherlock Holmes club was killed. Nick and Warrick try to determine how the driver of jeep was killed when the car ran off the road. They have to do this under budget while Catherine is watched by Ecklie.

## Sara Sidle Review

Greg works his final proficiency with a little help from both Sara and Grissom. Sara helps Greg process the house and collect evidence, and later collects evidence from their suspects. When they think they have the right guy, Sara offers to celebrate with Greg after shift. While Greg's initial theory of the crime is wrong, he passes his solo proficiency -- in Grissom's office, Sara hugs Greg, and celebrates with the team.

## Character Notes

* Sara read The Hound of the Baskervilles in the tenth grade. However, she doesn't know much else about Sherlock Holmes.  
* Sara hugs Greg when he passes his final proficiency exam, and is one of those who agrees with continuing the celebration after Ecklie told them to get back to work.  
* Part of Sara's continued tutelage of Greg.
