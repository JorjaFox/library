Sara Sidle is a fictional character featured in the television series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]. She is depicted by [[Jorja Fox]].

==Backstory==  
Sara Sidle was born and raised an hour and half outside San Francisco on Tamales Bay. An only child of ex-hippies running a bed and breakfast, Sara always needed a bigger stage. Everything about her as a child was outsized: her intelligence, her energy, her curiosity. Sara was pretty much all-or-nothing in high school, and as talented as she was, grace didnât come with the package. The other kids resented her, and she did nothing to ease the resentment. However, a shocking incident ended her childhood instantly: after years of abuse, her mother killed her father. Sara was subsequently placed in foster care. 

At eighteen, Sara found a place where she could be at home. She went to Harvard and enjoyed four of the best years of her life. She took as many classes as she could. She went to as many parties as she could. And she finally dated. Not well, but at least she tried. She attended graduate school in theoretical physics before realizing that she was too frenetic for a life of scholarly contemplation. One year later, she got a job in the San Francisco coronerâs office and spent five years there gaining an unofficial education in forensic science. After that, she transferred to the San Francisco crime lab before being contacted by [[Grissom]], who asked her to [[Cool Change|come to Las Vegas]]. 

Like any tragic figure worth her salt, Sara has a single flaw: people. She can solve any problem except the problem of other people and how sheâs supposed to relate to them. As a result, she hides in her job. She pursues her career rigorously, perhaps more so than any of the other CSIs, partly because sheâs afraid of what sheâd find out about herself if she ever slowed down. Fortunately, Sara finally confronted her fears of intimacy when she moved forward into a romantic relationship with Gil Grissom.

==Quotation==  
:&#8221;'Sara&#8221;': When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for a while for evaluation. It looked the same, it smelled the same. It smelled like lies.  
:&#8221;'Grissom&#8221;': You sure you're okay?  
:&#8221;'Sara&#8221;': Crazy people do make me feel crazy.[&#8230;]

:&#8221;'Sara:&#8221;' [&#8230;] The only reason this is your lab is because Grissom doesn't kiss ass. You couldn't hack it in the field, so you fail your way up, you break up our team, and now you just hang out in the hallways waiting for one of us to screw up.  
:&#8221;'Ecklie:&#8221;' Sidle, you're on one-week suspension without pay&#8230;  
:&#8221;'Sara:&#8221;' Great.  
:&#8221;'Ecklie:&#8221;' &#8230;and when you get back, you're apologizing to Catherine.  
:&#8221;'Sara:&#8221;' No, I'm not
