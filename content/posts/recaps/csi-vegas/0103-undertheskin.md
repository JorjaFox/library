## Synopsis

IA enters the fray. Internal Affairs has begun to look into the charges against David Hodges. Meanwhile, the lab must solve the case of a woman murdered at a gaming convention.

## Review

Internal Affairs wants to take the case against Hodges out of the lab. Which frankly makes sense.

## Notes

* Grissom is suffering from [Mal de Debarquement (aka 'land sickness')](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_de_debarquement).

## Quotes

**Sidle:** We'll figure it out, okay? I'll never go away. If you have to hold on to something, hold on to me.
