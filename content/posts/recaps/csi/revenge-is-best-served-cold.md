## Synopsis

The top-rated drama gets off to a speedy start in its third-season opener, in which the teams investigate the murder of a street racer and the untimely death of a legendary poker player. Catherine and Nick become absorbed in the dangerous world of street racing after one of the illegal sport's hotshot drivers is found dead out in the desert at an abandoned airstrip. Back in town, Grissom and his crew probe the sudden death of a renowned poker player who suffered a violent convulsion in the middle of a high-stakes game with three others. It looks like natural causes, at first, but Grissom suspects foul play.
