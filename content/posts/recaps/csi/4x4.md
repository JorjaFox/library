## Synopsis

A wild day in Las Vegas has the CSIs simultaneously investigating four fatalities. Catherine and Warrick look into the death of an auto convention model found murdered in a camper on display, as Nick examines the death of a boy found beaten and burned on a bus bench outside a mini-mall. Across town, the investigation into a car accident leads Grissom to suspect the driver was aiming at his victim, and Greg and Sara discover that toxic mold has eaten away at a body builder from the inside out.

## Sara Sidle Review

Possibly contaminated by mold at the crime scene, Sara and Greg end up getting a Hazmat shower together (Greg claims that he didn't look, while Sara definitely did).

## Character Notes

* Sara has a tattoo of a flower on her left ankle.

## Quotes

**Sanders:** Sara, I just want you to know that when we were in the shower together, I didn't see anything.  
**Sidle:** Really? Gosh, I saw everything...
