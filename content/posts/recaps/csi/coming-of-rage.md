## Synopsis

A teenager is found murdered on a construction site. Grissom, **Sara**, and Warrick follow the lead of blood on a hammer. Nick, with an assist from Catherine, tries to find how a woman was killed by a gunshot on her lawn when no one nearby had a gun.

## Sara Sidle Review

Sara cuts the construction workers cold when they try to flirt with her at the crime scene. Later, when she discovers that the girl lied about being raped, she's angry and hurt because she believed in her.

## Character Notes

* Sara takes it personally, with a sense of betrayal, when she learns that the teen lied about being raped.  
* Sara is again 'played' by a suspect because she takes their words at face value.

**Sidle:** You're not a victim, you were a lure. Do you know how many people don't report a rape because they're afraid that no one will believe them?  
**Ashley** Of course. It's what I was counting on.  
**Sidle:** I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that you're tried as an adult.
