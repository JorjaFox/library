Grading is a fairly subjective way of rating a TV show or movie by way of how much is Jorja Fox's character involved, and how much screen time does she get.

The objective is to give the highest 'score' to anything that someone should watch if looking for a great representation of Jorja Fox's work as an actor. This is not an attempt to grade how good a movie or TV show is. In fact, Memento is a highly acclaimed movie and only has a 'score' of 2, because Jorja Fox's role is quite minor. Rating also may not reflect how much screen time Jorja has. For example, in the _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode A La Cart, she's in three scenes, however a great deal of characterization is developed in those scenes.

Grades are given on a loose scale of 0 to 5 stars, with a rough guideline as follows:

## Red Stars

{{< star color="red-star" >}}{{< star color="red-star" >}}{{< star color="red-star" >}}{{< star color="red-star" >}}{{< star color="red-star" >}} - Has not been viewed.

Example: Anything that has not yet aired or been seen.

## No Gold Stars

{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}} - Credited but does not appear.

Example: The _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode "Pilot".

## One Gold Stars

{{< star color="gold-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}}{{< star color="grey-star" >}} - Very brief scene or two, no more than 2 minutes total. Often as a guest actor.

Example: The _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ episode "High and Low" or the movie [The Jerky Boys](/library/actor/jerky-boys).


## Two Gold Stars
