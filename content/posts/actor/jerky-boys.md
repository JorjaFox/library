When a former high school classmate brags about his mob connections, the Jerky Boys -- a pair of thirty-something slackers who pride themselves on devious prank phone calls -- decide to have a little fun in the Mafia underworld. However, when a cop mistakes the Jerky Boys for actual hit men, their innocent game causes more trouble than they would've ever imagined.

## Character

Jorja Fox plays Lazarro's Young Lady. Lazarro works for the Mafia, and his Young Lady is basically a hired call girl.
