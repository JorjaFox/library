<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> In the mean time my girl is here.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Hey. (hug)</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Hey Jorja, nice to see you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> How are you?</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> So we are looking at one of the stars of one of the number one shows [[CSI]] …they’re still watchin’ Jorja.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Ahh, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You’ve got to show yourself off here Jorja, because everybody’s looking for you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I’ll try…okay.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Okay, got to tell you, great figure…</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> I’m not going to pick on you and say if you ate a doughnut you’d look pregnant, but what did you eat today girl?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughs) I had a half of a real Food Daily cheeseburger.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You did!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> That’s all I had, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Yeah, but you did have a little cheesburger. A little nourishment.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, vegetarian with the vege bacon and the vege cheese…but it’s a cheeseburger.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> But it’s still a cheeseburger.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You didn’t do that stalk and cellery and lettuce thing?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, no, no, I gave up on all that.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You did?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, I can’t maintain all that. And I had a little bit of vodka and 7Up in the car. But don’t tell anyone, shh.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> That’s my girl, so you’re drinking vodka and 7Up in the car, shh, don’t tell anyone… what are you listening to on the radio?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Radio didn’t work, my goodness, so we listened to you know, sky, the sky sounds, that kind of thing. Sometimes I bring CDs, but I bring em’, then I forget em’. So I try to leave them at home and I should have today because the radio was broken.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> So all over limos in Los Angeles have like a stock of Jorja Fox CDs.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughs) Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You won’t have any left. Are you excited about tonight?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I am. I love this award show.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> It’s a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I’m like a little kid. And it’s so nice you know, the movie people and the TV people are together…</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Absolutely</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And it’s kind of a small space… and it feels I know it’s weird to say but kind of family, like there’s a family feel.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> You know why? Because it’s actors honouring other actors, and you all are a family.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yes, exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> And I just want to tell you…</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> A happy family.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> A little dysfunctional, but a family none the less. Well, we wish you the best for CSI this year.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you. You are wonderful.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I love seeing you here.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Yes, keep watchin’ baby, keep watchin’, we’ll see you next time.</p>
