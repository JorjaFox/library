<p>“The View” is a daytime television talk show on ABC which was created by Barbara Walters and premiered on August 11, 1997, to showcases women’s points of view on a variety of issues.</p>

<p><strong>Star Jones:</strong> Please welcome Jorja Fox and George Eads!</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> We’re out here in the sunshine… you guys are used to being in Vegas because CSI is shot-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Not, not during daylight hours though. <em>laughs, raises her hand to shade her eyes from the sun</em></p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Yeah, I know. Death so happens in the nighttime, normally.</p>

<p><strong>George Eads:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> So, any good gambling stories?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> <em>turns to George</em> Well…</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Um, I won $6,000 dollars once on a video poker machine.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> You did?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I shopped well on that money.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> You have to share it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong>: <em>nodding</em> Actually…</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Well video poker, it’s kind of a slower game, and I was playing with my dad, and we were really just catching up and I go <em>gesturing, look of mock surprise</em>, ‘Oh, Dad, I think I won a lot of money’.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Actually you’re wrong, you won 600, didn’t you George.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> No I won 6,000 and my dad had so much anxiety about gambling, it was every time you put the money in <em>pretending to wipe sweat from his face</em> it’s just ‘Oh’, I thought he was going to like pass out. So I just counted the money.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> <em>pushing it</em> I heard somewhere it was just 600 dollars,</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Well actually it was-</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Because 6,000 generates a lot more taxes.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Oh I paid all the taxes on it. <em>smirks at the crowd</em></p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> This is why lawyers can’t “stand” detectives ‘cause they don’t stiff, they don’t get it off. CSI is the number one prime time show in America. <em>applause from the audience and crowd</em></p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> I’m, I’m still amazed because it’s one of my favorite shows, you know I like all that forensics stuff. Does that, do you find that amazing?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you. <em>gesturing</em> I’m instantly blown away, completely blown away. But weekly I mean it’s always a surprise, every week when it happens, it’s always a surprise because you know, you never ever think it’s going to happen again, and then…</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Again.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Sometimes it happens again.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> And again and again and again…</p>

<p><strong>Meredith Viera:</strong> You learn a lot of stuff, don’t you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Not much.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> You don’t learn anything?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, I don’t.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Well, I think, I think when, a lot of times it can be a little intimidating so you just, like ‘aminonapathenetrisulphonic acid’. <em>general laughter</em> I woke up in my sleep the night before saying that one. <em>more laughter</em></p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> But if you don’t know what it, uh, what it means you kind of define it, phonetically pronounce it, and uh, there’s a tech there to show you how it’s applied.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I just write it on my hand.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> And then you fake it.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> And then we fake it real good.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I write it on my hand. <em>pushes her cap back a bit, looks down at her hand as if reading something written there</em></p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth Hasselbeck:</strong> Well we were here for a week and we’ve had so much fun already I can’t even imagine what it’s like to have this city for your backdrop all the time. There’s got to be some crazy things that happen.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Well as an actor if you have to work, uh, we kind of keep tabs on each other. Like <em>making a phone gesture</em> ‘Are you in bed? Get in bed’.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It can be a little distracting. I don’t know if that’s been your experience, but you know when you’re working, or if-</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> It’s very distracting. So much fun stuff to do.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It’s a lot of fun. We go home very tired.</p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> And we’re losing all of our money.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah. Well I play the nickel slots.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Oh really, well so does- <em>laughter, Barbara Walters reaches over, shakes Jorja Fox’ hand</em></p>

<p><strong>Barbara Walters:</strong> …I have it all worked out. You and I play the nickel slots-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Walters:</strong> I wouldn’t mind having a romance with you, you’re a great kid.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Hey!</p>

<p><em>George Eads - on the opposite side of Jorja from Barbara - gets up slowly and pretends to start to go over to hug Barbara</em></p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Barbara, Barbara, calm yourself!</p>

<p><em>George Eads sits back down, starts to crawl into Jorja’s lap while reaching out his hand to Barbara; Jorja pushes him back</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Fend him off. I’m going to fight him off. <em>George Eads sits back down</em></p>

<p><strong>Barbara:</strong> Remember that your father is benefitting. Is it true that a lot of what you- <em>turns to Meredith</em> I thought that was very nice of you.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Yeah, very polite.</p>

<p><strong>Barbara:</strong> Is it true that you based a lot of your character on your father who’s a district attorney, in Texas?</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Yeah, my, I think my dad carried a lot of angst as a D.A. for 28 years. Um, it was almost like Clint Eastwood at work and then he would come home-</p>

<p><strong>Barbara:</strong> Was it tough with your father?</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> -and he’s… It really got to him after a while, the, it’s the wake of sorrow that’s left after you lose someone that I think was the hardest thing for him to handle, and, and getting to play a character that can kind of have those emotions and passions for the victims, that kind of can’t speak for themselves any more, and uh, I was just so inspired by his passion for his work, it’s kind of fun to play dad a little bit. Hi, Dad.</p>

<p><strong>Joy Behar:</strong> My dad was actually a medical examiner, a family doc, so I can relate to a lot of the scenes, in your show. But there’s a lot of gore - how do you guys handle that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I’m nauseous most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> You are nauseous?</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Try not to eat.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, we don’t eat much.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Before you go to work.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> At work.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> No, it, that, sometimes, when I don’t think it can get any grosser…</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> And then it does.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> We had an episode that we just shot last week where um, <em>laughs</em>, someone had been-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> That’s funny. <em>laughs</em> You’re laughing.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> I don’t know why it’s funny.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It’s funny because-</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Because it’s make-believe.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> -it’s so disgusting.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> -where an inmate tried to escape from prison by attaching themselves to the bottom of a bus, unsuccessfully. <em>chorus of disgust noise</em></p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> I always hate the ones you do where there’re floaters, where the people come out of the water,</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> You all like the floating scenes.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> I did that once, where I didn’t have a Metro card.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> No?</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> <em>gesturing</em> Sometimes you just have to get some place, you know?</p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I would, I would just have a tough time, y’know, leaving and going to sleep at night, dealing with the forensic science and all the darkness and gruesome-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Nightmares.</p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> Until, nightmares.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> If I read the scripts before I go to bed I still get nightmares.</p>

<p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong> I wouldn’t be able to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Drink a lot of beers.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> Yeah, there’s some - I don’t really get nightmares that are full on beginning, middle, and end stories that I can remember, but, there are flashes in my mind that wake me up sometimes but…</p>

<p><strong>Barbara:</strong> Do you think that’s what one of the reasons the show is so popular is because of the gore? <em>she points at George</em> Are you going to tear- <em>George starts to gesture at Jorja with his thumb, Meredith interrupts</em></p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Why does everybody keep bringing Al Gore into this? (laughter) Leave him alone, he lost. Leave him alone. The gore, the gore, the gore. (more laughter)</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> He didn’t lose, he-</p>

<p><strong>Barbara:</strong> What a nice compliment you just got from your partner, that’s very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, thank you. Very kind.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Well I still say-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> He’s my man.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> -you play one of the best casts on television, I love watching you all, I have since the beginning and we big fans of the show, so-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>

<p><strong>Star:</strong> Thank you very much, thank you for bringing us to Vegas also. Every single week. I thank you Jorja Fox and to George Eads, CSI airs Thursday night, and we’ll be right back.</p>
