<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Thank you. I am here with the cast of CSI. Your show has taken off, like, y’know. A train, just steaming right out of the station.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We’re dazed. We’re dazed and confused and so happy and yeah! It’s great.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> I see Marg has gotten a lot of attention for the show for the last, what? For last season.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> But now the whole show is being acknowledged tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Robert David Hall</strong> It’s the great chemistry. It’s a lot of fun to go to work.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now did anyone, did any of you get offers, or did everyone have to sort of go through the whole process?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> They actually made us all audition, I think. Anyone-</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Hall</strong> Except for Billy Petersen.</p>

<p>“(everyone laughs)”</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How many times- How many times did you have to come back?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Twice.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Two times, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Szmanda</strong> Two.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Oh they already hired me like months before, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now, and you shoot on location in Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How much fun is Vegas?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It’s hard to concentrate sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Vegas is it’s own character, you know. Vegas, Vegas- We don’t have to do anything, it does itself, so…</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Do you still, like, walk to the casinos and go ‘Oh, I’m gonna go out tonight,’ or is it more is it just like ‘eh it’s Vegas’? Cause I spent a lot of time there, growing up, when my mom was working there, and you kind of get numb to the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There are certain ones of us here who have to have their money held for them.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Ahhh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I won’t mention any names “(points to Gary, George and herself)” but they’re here.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> We’ll save that for the ending interview, how about that? Cause I have a feeling you guys are all going to be nominated for that. Thank you so much for stopping and best of luck tonight.</p>
