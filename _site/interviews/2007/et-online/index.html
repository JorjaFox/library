<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> How fun is this, right? And what a tease for me!</p>

<p><strong>Jann Carl:</strong> I know!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Such a tease! They tell – I’m under the understanding that when I’m done today, they’re gonna let me take a little spin around the track.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p><strong>Carl:</strong> You’re back?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I made it! I made it. I survived. I know.</p>

<p><strong>Carl:</strong> And you don’t look any worse off for it.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Well thank you. No worse for wear.</p>

<p><strong>Carl:</strong> You fooled everybody all summer.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Carl:</strong> So When you would see people this summer, what were- What happened?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> My family has asked me questions, and I have to say to them ‘Come on. You know!’ You know? And really, I lied to my own family. ‘I don’t know anything.’</p>

<p><strong>Carl:</strong> What’s going to happen with you - with Sara and Grissom. That, okay, it’s out, now it’s out. They didn’t want it to be out.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I know! You know what? I’m under a car, and he goes and tells everybody that we’re having an affair! I couldn’t believe it! You know, I don’t know. I wish I could tell you.</p>
