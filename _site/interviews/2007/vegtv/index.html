<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> VegTV on the road with Marie Oser.</p>

<p><strong>Marie Oser:</strong> I’m here with Jorja Fox from “CSI”, a long time vegetarian, vegan. I asked you once what was your epiphany; it was a meatball sub in Brooklyn. And that was great!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> “*laughing*” I told that story a couple of days ago to a friend! “CSI” ‘s out here in force tonight, there’s actually a little posse of us. There’s a couple vegetarians that I work with and a couple of vegans. You know, when we can we’ve done, uh, three stories that I can think of right now that really kind of focus on animal welfare issues.</p>

<p><strong>Marie Oser:</strong> We so appreciate everything you do for the animals.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you so much! There are so many causes and people always have to follow their passion, you know, and if we’re all doing that just a little bit, then the whole world’s going to be better on every level, you know? For people and animals and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Marie Oser:</strong> What a great role model! I mean she’s been a vegetarian most of her life!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> If everybody just tried to cut down a little bit on these things, it would make a huge global impact very quickly. You’d be surprised. So, check it out.</p>

<p><strong>Marie Oser:</strong> Cool. Check it out!</p>
