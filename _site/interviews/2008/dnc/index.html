<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Hi, I’m Jorja Fox. I’m on CSI sometimes. I don’t know what I’m doing here at the DNC, I’m really confused. I’m in Denver. I just kidding! I’m here- I’m just honored, I feel so blessed I get to witness this amazing moment in history. Yes we can! Go Barak. Good luck, we love you. Thank you.</p>
