<p><em>The New York Times had run a story saying that Jorja would be appearing on the show “The Bachelorette” - she joked about in on “The View”.</em></p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> Welcome to “The View”, live from L.A. “CSI:” star Jorja Fox is our celebrity co-host today. Welcome to you, you look great.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you so much. I feel like I’m in New York City right now, being with you guys, which is so nice for me, cause I’m from there-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Tell them about your name, “Jorja”.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> My name’s Jorja-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Tell them how you spell it - J-O-R-J-A.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> We’re trying to figure out what that spelling is.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> My mom made it up, actually.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> She made it up.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. Child of the, you know, late sixties, early seventies, somewhere in there.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> That’s kind of cute.</p>

<p><strong>Meredith:</strong> That is very cute.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p><strong>Meredith Viera:</strong> Jorja, what the New York Times thought of it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> “(laughter)” Um, I was somewhere in there, I think, behind the heart-soap stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Did you buy it, did you feel that, you know…</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I had friends who flew in from New York City yesterday and had a long flight and presented me with the Times, and I heard where I was going to be this morning.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> No, but you go by the storyline, on The Bachelorette.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh, on The Bachelorette, I’m sorry I was “(points her thumb at the backstage area, lots of laughter)”</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Throw the Times away and think trash.</p>
