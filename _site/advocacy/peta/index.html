<p>PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is the largest animal rights organization in the world.</p>

<p>PETA focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of beavers, birds and other ‘pests,’ and the abuse of backyard dogs.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox is a supporter of PETA and has attended many functions, as well as appearing in a celebrity vegetarian testimonial campaign.</p>
