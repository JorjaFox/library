<p>Friends of El Faro has a simple mission — to help improve the lives of the orphans at El Faro (in Mexico) in any way possible. El Faro 2 (The Lighthouse) was founded in the 1990, when Carmen and Jorge Gonzales opened the doors of their home to a few abandoned children living on the streets. Word spread and in a very short amount of time children were being dropped off in the middle of the night by relatives who could not care for them, or were frightened because of a history of abuse.</p>

<p>In November of 2000, Adam and Leigh Smith started taking trips to visit the children at an orphanage called El Faro 2 in Tijuana, Mexico. Word spread and people from all over Los Angeles began to ask how they could help, and soon ‘‘Friends of El Faro’’ was born.</p>
