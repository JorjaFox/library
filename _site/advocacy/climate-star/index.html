<p>==Intro==<br />
The hottest stars in the entertainment universe are concerned about something serious that’s happening to our planet – global warming. The following is from the advert Jorja Fox was in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stranded</strong>.</p>

  <p>No, it’s not a new reality show.</p>

  <p>It’s what thousands of species now face thanks to global warming. Habitats are changing along with the climate, and many species will disappear from their present homes while others may disappear altogether. We can slow global warming down if we take action now.</p>

  <p>Global warming isn’t cool. Stopping it is.</p>
