<p><strong>Eric Szmanda:</strong> Alright, want to play a new game?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Alright, this one’s called forced labor. I’ll be a Burmese soldier. You will be a Burmese civilian. First, I’ll beat and rape your wife. Then, I’ll murder your children. Then, I’ll burn your village to the ground. I’ll make you carry my supplies and ammunition for days, until your feet are raw and bleeding. You will not be fed, and as we walk, you will lead the way, so if we find any landmines, you’ll be the first to discover them. If you get sick and slow, I’ll beat you. And if you try to escape, I’ll kill you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Why do I have to be the Burmese civilian?</p>

<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Since the illegal military regime took over? Those are the cards you’ve been dealt.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I don’t think I like this game.</p>

<p><strong>Eric:</strong> No one does.</p>
