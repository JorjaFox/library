<p>Two stars of the CBS hit television series “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation” were fired for breach of contract and one failed to show up for work, KCBS-TV and Variety reported Thursday.</p>

<p>Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes, were fired after asking for more money to stay on the show, according to the reports.</p>

<p>Danica Smith, publicist for both Fox and Eads, told The Associated Press that Fox was fired Wednesday but did not have details. Smith could not confirm whether Eads was fired.</p>

<p>A CBS spokesman said the network had no comment.</p>

<p>Eads didn’t show up for work Thursday, the first day of production for the next season, according to the news station and Variety, which posted a story on its Web site Thursday.</p>

<p>The actors were in the fifth of their seven-year contracts.</p>

<p>Though a search was underway for their replacements, it’s unclear whether show creators will recast the characters or develop new ones, the reports said.</p>

<p>The show picked up four Emmy nominations Thursday, including one for best drama series.</p>
