## Synopsis

Two amorous freshmen are found dead on a sleeping bag in a dorm room, and Sara and Greg run into one dead end after another as they try to determine why the students were killed. Warrick, Nick and Catherine figure out how a man is found dead in the center of a crop circle. Ecklie is called into duty for a man found dead in his car and his body later goes missing.

## Sara Sidle Review

Sara and Greg investigate the college murders, and after several setbacks (including an exploding toilet) determine that dry ice was used to murder the two students. Sara compliments Greg on his theories and his work. Sara apparently doesn't know about some college sexual rituals.

* Sara always drives, according to Greg.
