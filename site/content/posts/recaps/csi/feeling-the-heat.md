## Synopsis

During Vegas's latest Heat wave of triple digit temperatures, Gil and Catherine investigate a baby locked in a car. Warrick investigates a man dead of an apparent heat stroke in his house. Nick and Sarah investigate a woman's body found floating in the lake with a blow to the head.

## Sara Sidle Review

Sara is suspicious of the boyfriend until he's found dead, having tried to rescue the girl. Later she takes Nick to task for telling the family that their son was a hero.

## Character Notes

* Sara shows a bias, assuming that the boy killed the girl, and seems disappointed when he shows up dead.

## Quotes

**Sidle:** What did you tell him? His son died a hero?  
**Stokes:** Look, I'm just trying to give the guy a little peace, you know?  
**Sidle:** Oh, well, who are you trying to help feel better, him or you?  
**Stokes:** Hey, let me ask you something, Sara: You're Mr. Young, would you rather know this much or nothing at all?  
**Sidle:** You know, if the evidence doesn't support the answer, a CSI shouldn't be asking that question.
