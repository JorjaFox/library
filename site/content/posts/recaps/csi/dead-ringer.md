## Synopsis

Grissom, Catherine and Nick investigate the death of a runner during a competition. Meanwhile Sara and Warrick investigate the death of couple in a hotel room, initially thought to be a murder-suicide. Both cases take place during this 'cop' competition , with more than 20.000 attendants (all of them cops). This gives the investigations an interesting turn, as almost all the suspects and all dead people are cops.
