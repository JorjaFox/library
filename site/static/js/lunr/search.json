        "content": "\nRecap\n\nChuck Weber is a race car driver who is down on his luck and nothing has gone right in twenty years, which happens to be the last time he won a race. Divorced, struggling to pay for his car and the alimony for his son, Willy (aka Worm), the only bright spot in his life is racing at the Speedbowl, a lock stock-car track run by Sal.\n\nAfter crashing into the wall and losing his sponsorship, Chuck fears his dreams are at an end when Sal loses his sponsorship from Rob's furniture. In a desperate grab to save his track, Sal convinces Rob to fund one driver to the Daytona 500. Rob balks at the idea of supporting Sal's driver, Buddy, so Sal suggests a race - winner takes all.\n\nCheryl, Chuck's pit crew and girlfriend (called 'Trenton trash' by Katie, Chuck's ex-wife), spends her days working at a machine shop. Unlike Chuck, Cheryl saves her money with the hope of making her own speed shop. Still, she bets on Chuck, and when she finds out about the race, she funds Chuck's repairs. Katie demands the money for alimony instead, which makes Chuck unable to pay for his car, and pisses Cheryl off to no end.\n\nAfter being kicked out by Cheryl, Chuck takes his son to his old trailer, filled with his old trophies, which Worm had never seen before. Chuck finally tells Worm that he started losing races when his father stepped in to be his pit boss, replacing Sal. Young Chuck was so frustrated with his father's ways, he intentionally crashed his car, and hasn't won a race since.\n\nOne of Chuck coworkers, Steve, harasses him at work and happens to be dating Katie. Finally he challenges Chuck to a race to the airport: whomever picks up the customer first wins the race, and the car. Now armed with the money, Chuck retrieves his car and apologizes to Cheryl, who refuses to go help him. The only person who will go to the track with Chuck is his son, who now insists on being called Willy and has been failing math since he spends his time trying to fix Chuck's car. Katie, however, blackmails Chuck for all of his winnings just to let Willy go to the race.\n\nJust as the race starts, Cheryl arrives to manage the pit and works with Willy to improve the speed and performance of the car. When Chuck starts to waver, Willy provides the emotional stimulus to win, and the trio finally move forward to Daytona.\n\n Character\n\nCheryl constantly bets on Chuck, losing money every race by literally betting on him. She loses her cool when he spends money meant for the car on his alimony, but accepts his apology and helps him at the end. Cheryl has a remarkable eye for the track, spotting a crash before it happens, and is innovative, using a hair clip for the car's missing hood pin. While it's clear she and Chuck have feelings for each other, they only kiss after he wins the Speedbowl race.",

The three phases are presented as distinct, titled vignettes, \"Charity,\" \"Hope,\" and \"Faith,\" centered upon Louisa Garrison, a woman who translates folk tales. She is first seen working in a bookstore. Though involved with Ethan, she decides to break up with him because she strongly suspects that he is still in love with Kitty, his ex-girl friend. Ethan swears his innocence, but it's to no avail. Somewhat obsessed with Kitty, Louisa begins investigating her and then learns that Ethan died in a car wreck. She goes to Kitty and becomes her friend. The grieving Kitty has no idea that Louisa was ever involved with Ethan. In the next segment, Louisa goes to see Jane, her older sister, who has just learned that she has cancer. Louisa is surprised to learn her sister is a lesbian. It also hurts her to realize that while Jane is gentle and giving to everyone around her, she is cold and remote from Louisa. In the last vignette, Louisa moves to a remote artists' colony and there falls in love with Duncan, a man she used to work with.\n\nJorja Fox plays Josie (credited as Jorjan Fox).",

Keeping in theme with the setting, investigations often lead to taboo subjects, such as sexual deviations. The bizarre conclusions of these cases often force one to question morals and beliefs and possibly human nature in general.\n\n Character\n\nJorja Fox plays Sara Sidle, who hails from San Francisco, and was brought in by personal request of CSI Supervisor Gil Grissom to investigate the shooting (and subsequent death of) Holly Gribbs. Since then, Sara remained on the team and proved her worth while solving crimes. Sidle's relationship with many of her teammates is contentious and layered, as she does not often open up to them. Sara doesn't really have any friends or interests outside of work, which can occasionally cause problems; she can also be obsessive about certain types of cases. \n\nOver time, her relationship with Grissom develops into one of romance, which suffers a setback when, after being kidnapped by a serial killer and nearly dying of exposure, Sara leaves Las Vegas. Sara returns briefly to mourn the death of Warrick Brown, but leaves for Costa Rica. Grissom comes after her when, shortly there after, he too leaves the lab. After a year away, Sara returns yet again, married to Grissom, although he remains in Paris while she works in Las Vegas. Their relationship suffers from the distance and they end up divorcing.\n\nIn the series finale, Sara is promoted to Lab Director following a convoluted and deeply personal case which brings Grissom back to Las Vegas not for her, but for Lady Heather. However when Grissom confesses his love for Sara to Heather, she gives up Las Vegas to be with him.\n\nSee Also\n\nCSI Episodes",

As her soul enters the gates of Heaven, she finds herself being judged by a gatekeeper named Fred. As a result of her shallowness, Fred declares her a \"zero-zero,\" since she has performed zero good deeds and zero bad deeds during her time on Earth. While he's distracted, Deb presses the \"return\" key before Fred can stop her and is brought back to life in the body of a recently deceased lawyer named Jane Bingum , who died protecting her boss, Jay Parker.\n\nJane is the complete opposite of Deb; she is brilliant, hard-working, charitable, and plus size. Deb finds that Jane also works in the same law firm, Harrison-Parker, as Deb's fiancé Grayson Kent. After immediately telling her best friend, Stacy, of her predicament, Deb prepares herself to tell Grayson the truth about her new body. However, Fred’s assignment as Deb’s guardian angel serves as punishment for letting her leave heaven. His purpose on Earth is to prevent Deb from telling Grayson the truth and insisting that no one else can know that it is really Deb in Jane's body.\n\nDeb struggles to learn more about her inherited life, learning lessons about self-esteem and personal acceptance. Eventually, the real Jane Bingum reappears in another person's body after having pressed the return key, leading Deb to finally reveal the truth to Grayson, now one of Jane's closest friends. Grayson, after grieving and moving on from Deb's passing, becomes conflicted, but finally accepts Deb in her new body, saying that he wants her to be her and no one else.\n\nIn addition to working with Grayson at the law firm, Deb (as Jane) also contends with her professional rival, Kim Kaswell, who briefly dates Grayson after Deb's passing.\n\nEpisode: \"Second Chances\"\n\nAired 16 August 2009\nSeason 1, Episode 6\n\nMaryAnn Neely comes to see Jane in her office, having met her a few years prior when Jane worked a pro-bono case for the St. Jude's Hospital, where MaryAnn worked as a nurse.  Scared and needing help, MaryAnn doesn't get to explain much before the police arrive and arrest her for murder.\n\nAt 18, MaryAnn's boyfriend had her stay in the car while, unknown to her, he robbed a continence store.  The robbery went bad, he killed the clerk, and MaryAnn was culpable for not only accessory to murder, but also murder in the second degree.  Hearing the DA was pushing for the death sentence, MaryAnn ran once she got out on bail, changed her name and started a new life.  She fell in love, got married and had two children.  When the hospital started fingerprinting everyone for security, MaryAnn knew she'd be caught, so she wrote a note to her husband, Phillip, and went to Jane's office so she wouldn't be arrested in front of her children.\n\nUpset at the deception, Phillip has trouble putting aside his feelings of betrayal, and in a case where the law isn't on their side, Jane has to humanize MaryAnn, and prove she's not the same person she was 20 years ago.  While MaryAnn's coworkers extol her virtues, the most the DA is willing to offer is a reduction. Ten years for manslaughter.  At first, MaryAnn is more concerned that Phillip won't testify, but then the idea of ten years, away from her children, scares her.  Jane suggests that MaryAnn take the stand, and tell the jury what she never told her husband.\n\nMaryAnn's testimony sways her husband, and he wants to testify but it's after the Defense rests and no further testimony can be heard.  Instead, Jane quotes a letter from him in her closing argument, arguing for MaryAnn's rehabilitation as service enough.\n\nMaryAnn is found guilty of accessory, innocent of murder, and sentence to time served for the community.\n\nCharacter##\nJorja plays the soccer mom, MaryAnn Neely (formerly Fay Greene), whose criminal past comes back to haunt her.",

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nIn a small coastal community in New Jersey, the only action in town is a run-down nightclub called Pavillion. The club's owner, Pete (Jackson Sims), can barely make the payroll for Rags the bartender (William Russell), Myra the barmaid (Jorjan Fox) (who is also Pete's daughter), and clean-up man Ralph (Steve Monroe). In a bid to bring in more customers, Pete hires a stripper, Danny Lee (Cathy Haase). Danny Lee's act soon turns Ralph's head, which is not good news for his wife Luanne (Loretta Gross).\n\nTwenty years older than her husband, Luanne is unable to get out of bed (though the doctor says that there's no medical explanation for this), and while she grudging allows Ralph to sleep with other women, the notion that he might fall in love with someone else sends her into a fit of rage. Luanne's greatest talent (and her most potent weapon) is her gift for gossip, and when she begins to suspect that Ralph might want to leave her for Danny Lee, she starts spreading ugly rumors that have just enough basis in fact to stick. Before long, Luanne has circulated the word that Myra is a drug addict and that her boyfriend Bobbie (Andrew Lee Barrett) is pushing dope at the club, that Pete had an incestuous relationship with Myra, and that Rags was responsible for the death of his family in a car wreck.\n\nAs this bitter misinformation sweeps through the town, Luanne turns up dead, but this proves to be the beginning and not the end of a wave of violence and ugliness.\n\n Character\n\nCredited as Jorjan Fox.\n\nMyra Pavlov is a barmaid at her father's nightclub. Myra is in an abusive relationship with both her father (who raped her when she was 12) and her boyfriend, who is not only physically and sexually abusive, but also gets her hooked on heroin. The movie is told, somewhat, in Myra's perspective, and in the end, she is the only one left responsible for what was done.",

Jorja Fox plays Catherine Shelby, the wife of Leonard Shelby (Pearce), who was raped and murdered in the couple's home.\n\nRecap\n\nAround 2:00 AM (Nov. 1997) police were called to the home of Leonard and Catherine Shelby, after two neighbors reported hearing gunshots. The front door was open, and they found the Shelbys in serious condition. Catherine (age 32) was brought to the hospital and listed in critical condition, having been sexually assaulted and having received a number of serious injuries to her head, neck and upper body. Leonard was stable, after receiving several severe blows to the head. Catherine later died from her injuries, while her husband suffers from 'severe anterograde memory dysfunction as a result of head trauma' and recovers 'almost none of his ability to convert short-term experiences to long term memory'.\n\nOver the course of the movie - which is told in reverse chronological order - Leonard tries to find out who killed his wife, and extract revenge with the help of Natalie and a lot of tattoos.\n\nThough the character of Catherine Shelby is supposedly murdered, at the end of the movie we see the couple in bed together, with Leonard sporting all of his tattoos. This makes it appear as if he's completed his revenge quest, yet his wife is still alive.\n\n Character\n\nCatherine is the dead wife of Leonard Shelby, appearing only in flashbacks throughout the movie.\n\nThe circumstances of her death are murky, and either she was raped and murdered during a home invasion, or she died later due to an overdose of insulin medication.",

Ray would then come out from his office and hand out the cases for the day. Episode titles were all taken from a quote from their episode. The characters are all very familiar and jovial with each other.\n\nJorja Fox stared as Detective Constance 'Connie' Karadzic, credited as Jorjan Fox.\n\nCharacter\n\nOfficer Constance (Connie) Karadzic is a twenty-something, friendly, emotional, caring, if a little sulky, member of the Missing Persons team. Her hard personal life has made her more passionate about her work, and she often puts in very long hours for fear of missing an important phone call or development if she were to go home. She rarely tells the rest of the team anything about her personal life, but is familiar with many details of their lives. Relatively new to field work, Connie often comes across as young and naive, but also uses her apparent innocence to cajole suspects and witnesses into talking to her.\n\n Character History\n\nConnie spends much of the first episode being relegated to the office, and often chaffs at the Lieutenant's restrictions. She wants nothing more than to be in the field, but none of her fellow officers will go against the Lieutenant's wishes. Once Connie gets her break, she begins field work with the rest of the boys, but is always cognizant of the Lieutenant's wishes.\n\nDivorced, Connie still wears her wedding ring in order to avoid being hit on at work, and allows her co-workers to believe she's still married. Connie's ex was a cop in Wisconsin, but he had turned out to be a violent, alcoholic, bully. After leaving him, Connie became a cop in Chicago, retaining her maiden name. While her brother, Richard, supported her choice, Connie's father claims that she should have made her marriage work, and this is the heart of a family dispute. In order to deceive her co-workers, Connie has a picture of her brother (as an usher) and her in her wedding dress on her desk.\n\nJohnny Sandowski learns Connie's divorced, but honors her request not to tell anyone, making him her slave. Connie also tells the Lieutenant later on, confiding in him her cancer scare as well. She works with the Lieutenant's wife to plan a surprise party for his birthday.\n\nBy the end of the series, Connie is dating again and has a new boyfriend.\n\nSee Also\n\nCSI Episodes",

Upon arrival in Bakersfield, Charles gets sidetracked when he falls in love with Tracy Morris, a local teen, who is dating Jon Burroughs, a twenty something, small time drug dealer. \n\nJason finds his father, but the reunion is cut short when he realizes that his dad has moved on with a new family of his own and is not interested in making up for lost time. Jason abruptly leaves town. An abandoned Charles is left alone and is forced to befriend Jon and ask for his help. \n\nThrough Tracy's insistence, Jon drafts Charles as his drug runner.

Several months after it was shown, there were rumors that it would appear on the USA Network, but nothing substantial ever came of those rumors.\n\nThe initial casting call for this movie - which was shot all-digital in less than a month - called for \"non-name\" actors; ie, actors that weren't well known.

The strike, which could occur after the expiration of SAG's major contracts in June 2008, would stem from the current handling of royalties from the sale of films distributed through new media methods. This includes royalties earned from Internet distribution services such as iTunes, as well as DVD sales, neither of which are currently written into actors', writers', and directors' contracts. The strike date of June 2008 was chosen due to its coinciding with the expiration of several contracts between SAG and AMPTP.\n\nJorja Fox supported the strike and filmed a promo for the SAG, showing her support. She was also a SAG negotiator for the strike.\n\n Hi there, I'm Jorja Fox. I'm a proud card carrying SAG member and AFRA member. I would like to ask you to support your SAG negotiating team.

The very best thing that we can do for Billy, who has served his 20 years, and is due for pension and retirement, is release him back into the wild. Because that is not an option, I am humbly pleading today, of all of you, to release him to a sanctuary. We can be the people who have the vision, the wisdom, the compassion, and the generosity of spirit to do this one, simple, right, thing. This holistic thing. The dark and ignorant past is behind us. We cannot change it. But the future is actually in all of our hands. Let us move forward into something sustainable. Let us move forward into something kind.

        "content": "\nThe lithe and attractive brunette American actress Jorja Fox entered the public eye in the late '90s and early 2000s, given her involvement as a recurrent cast member in three consecutive, top-ranked U.S. television series: ER (1994), The West Wing (1999), and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000). Fox is perhaps most familiar to fans of CSI, appearing in well over 150 episodes and numerous seasons.\n\nBorn Jorja-An Fox on July 7, 1968, in New York, NY, but raised in Melbourne Beach, FL, Fox moved back to Manhattan in her teens and began a modeling career after winning a local modeling contest, then subsequently enrolled as a drama student at the Lee Strasberg Institute, where she studied acting under the aegis of legendary actor William Hickey (Prizzi's Honor, Forget Paris). Fox's early roles were minor and somewhat forgettable, though she debuted onscreen under the tutelage one of the finest American indie filmmakers &#8212; Maggie Greenwald &#8212; in that director's well-received film noir debut The Kill-Off (1991). She followed it up with an equally dark turn, as Fate 3 (alongside future West Wing co-star Allison Janney), in John Feldman's little-seen black comedy thriller Dead Funny (1995), and joined mentor Hickey and Alan Arkin for the best-forgotten Jerky Boys (1995) &#8212; a loud, rude and obnoxious farce about a couple of prank phone callers. The film bombed with critics and the public, and disappeared instantly.\n\nFox joined the cast of the blockbuster series ER in 1996, during its third season on the air. She played Maggie Doyle, a lesbian intern at County General Hospital who launches a sexual harassment suit against a seemingly invincible administrator. The role lasted for three seasons, wrapping in 1999; that same year, Fox signed for a supporting role on The West Wing, mega-producer Aaron Sorkin's blockbuster series drama about life in the Oval Office. In that series, Fox played Gina Toscano, the Secret Service agent hired to protect first daughter Zoey Bartlet (Elisabeth Moss) during the first and second seasons (1999-2001).\n\nFox's prominence rose with her comparatively higher billing in the hit CBS-Alliance-Atlantis series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She joined the cast of that series from its inception, as Sara Sidle, a maverick investigator who specializes in materials and elements analysis. As the series opened, team leader Gil Grissom (William Petersen) called Sidle in from her post at the San Francisco coroner's office to investigate the death of former CSI team member Holly Gribbs. After the unit solved that case, Grissom, impressed with her work, invited her to stay on board and solve additional cases. Series writers imparted an added dimension to Sidle's character by revealing a backstory that involved the spousal abuse of her father, her mother's decision to commit mariticide, and her own entry into foster care.\n\n~ Nathan Southern, All Movie Guide",

Honeypot is an independent theater company in Los Angeles, which so far has mounted six original productions, of which she has starred in four, written three and directed one.\n\nFox is a New York native currently living in Los Angeles.

For a complete list, please check her filmography.\n\n What was her first role?\n\nShe first played the Rooster, in a children production of Chicken Little. Her first professional role was as Myra Pavlov in The Kill-Off.\n\nWhy did Jorja Fox leave ER?\n\nSince she wasn't a main cast member, Jorja Fox had the freedom to film a pilot for a UPN series, The True Story. The pilot ep was reworked into The Beat, which was sans Fox and was canceled after a handful of episodes. She was then in two movies, The Hungry Bachelors Club and Velocity Trap, which accounts for her time between ER and The West Wing, which became her next TV project.\n\n Why did Jorja Fox leave the West Wing?\n\nHer role on The West Wing was only a guest-starring role, so when she got the call for CSI, she was able to audition for it - twice. Originally it had been hoped that she would continue to be a guest star on The West Wing, however her commitment to CSI kept her too busy.\n\nWas she really run over on The West Wing?\n\nYes. During the filming of the final episode for the season, a limousine ran over her legs. Thankfully, there were no broken bones or other permanent damage, but when she auditioned for CSI she did so on crutches.\n\n Does Jorja Fox like her CSI co-stars in real life?\n\nOff camera they're all friends, though Jorja's probably friendlier with Eric Szmanda, Gary Dourdan and George Eads, as they're closer to her age. By all reports, Jorja's friendly with everyone on the set, including William Peteresen and Marg Helgenberger.\n\nJorja Fox makes all these cute innuendos in interviews with her CSI co-stars. Do they mean anything?\n\nProbably not, she's just good friends with her co-stars. Go re-read the answer to 'Is Jorja dating anyone?' She's not dating Gary Dourdan, George Eads, or Eric Szmanda. I'm not going to dignify the questions of if she's dating any of the co-stars who are happily married to other people. Please get your heads out of the gutter.\n\n Was Jorja really fired from CSI?\n\nYes she was, for 'breach of contract' on July 16, 2004. Basically, CBS sent her a letter, asking her to sign it, that stated she wouldn't form a sick-out to bargain for the raise she asked for. Jorja sent the letter back via registered mail, while everyone else used a Fax. CBS claimed not to have received the letter, however the sign-for date on the registered mail supports otherwise. Jorja was hired back once this was resolved, however refused to return until CBS also re-hired George Eads, who had been fired at the same time.\n\nOf note, Jorja also did not agree to sign the contract extension (to remain on the show past season seven), which caused her not to receive a raise, like the rest of her co-workers. This may be related to why she chose to leave the show in season eight.\n\nAs of July 23, 2004 Jorja was officially rehired on CSI. If you want to follow the fun, go check the 2004 news section. There's a lot to read.\n\nWhy did Jorja leave CSI?\n\n There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old. If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don’t want some of those dreams to pass me by, I have to get off the ride for a while.\n\n Why did Jorja come back to CSI?\n\nIn season nine, Jorja came back to give William Petersen a great send off when he left the show.\n\nIn season ten, she came back because CBS asked if she'd be interested in coming back part-time, and she said yes. She stuck around for season eleven as a part time main cast member, returning to the credits, and stayed till the end.\n\nHas she been nominated for any awards?\n\nShe was in the first round of nominations for the 2007 primetime Emmys in the category \"Supporting Actress, Drama\" (for her work in the CSI episode Empty Eyes). However, she was removed from subsequent rounds of the nomination process. CSI has been nominated (and has won) several times.\n\n Where can I find her movies and TV shows?\n\nThe TV shows ER, The West Wing and CSI have all been released on DVD. You can also find the movie Memento on DVD, however many of her other films are difficult to find on DVD or VHS. Her guest appearances on Ellen and Law & Order are both available on DVD.\n\nIs it true she did a movie for free?\n\nThe independent film Next Exit was looking to cast no-name actors for the small buget movie. Jorja knew the director and offered to play the role for no pay. The film aired at a Los Angeles area film festival in January 2005."

        "uri": "/faq/grading",
        "content": "\nGrading is a fairly subjective way of rating a TV show or movie by way of how much is Jorja Fox's character involved, and how much screen time does she get.\n\nThe objective is to give the highest 'score' to anything that someone should watch if looking for a great representation of Jorja Fox's work as an actor. This is not an attempt to grade how good a movie or TV show is. In fact, Memento is a highly acclaimed movie and only has a 'score' of 2, because Jorja Fox's role is quite minor. Rating also may not reflect how much screen time Jorja has. For example, in the CSI episode A La Cart, she's in three scenes, however a great deal of characterization is developed in those scenes.\n\nGrades are given on a loose scale of 0 to 5 stars, with a rough guideline as follows:\n\nsvg version=\"1.1\" id=\"red-star\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\"

        "content": "\nQuestions here are about Jorja Fox's personal life and, in broad terms, her career, including how to get in touch with her.\n\nWho is Jorja Fox?\n\nJorja Fox is an actor, producer, activist and musician.\n\nShe is most well known for her TV work, having played the recurring role of Dr. Maggie Doyle on the NBC show ER from 10/10/1996 through 01/21/1999, the guest role of Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on NBC's The West Wing from 02/24/2000 through 09/2000, and the regular role of Sara Sidle on CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\n\nShe has also been seen in movies and award shows, and is an environmentalist and humanitarian who attends many outreach causes. For her other roles, see her filmography. For more about her background, read her biography.\n\n What's the deal with her name?\n\nThis question arises since Jorja Fox was listed as 'Jorjan Fox' in her first few movies, on Missing Persons, and on her first few episodes of ER. After a few episodes, her listing changed to 'Jorja Fox'. The confusion was compounded by the following rumor \"When [Jorja] joined the cast of ER, her name was shortened back to Jorja after a couple episodes, hence the confusion. In an interview she said that one day she woke up and wanted her name back.\"\n\nThe rumor is arguable, and not verifiable. The truth of the matter is that her birth name is 'Jorja-An' and Jorja is a shortening. Jorjan was bastardization of Jorja-An that was done when she was on Missing Persons.\n\nToday, both personally and professionally, she is known as 'Jorja Fox'.\n\nHow old is Jorja?\n\nShe was born July 7, 1968.\n\n How do you pronounce her name?\n\nJorja is pronounced just like the US state or the Eurasian country 'Georgia.'\n\nWhere does Jorja live?\n\nJorja lives around the Los Angeles area in California.\n\n How do I contact her?\n\nStudio Fan Mail  \n1048 Irvine Ave #624  \nNewport Beach, CA 92660  \n\nHow do I get an autographed picture of her?\n\nSend a letter to the above address. It may take a long time to get a reply though. All her fan mail is checked before it gets to her.\n\n Will you forward my email too her?\n\nI would if I could, but as I can't, please don't email personal letters to me. It's very embarrassing for me to read the reeeeally personal details of total strangers.\n\nWhat's her official website?\n\njorjafox.com\n\n Does Jorja have a Twitter/Myspace/Facebook account?\n\nYes.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nWhat movies and TV shows has she been in?\n\nJorja Fox most recently starred in the CBS drama CSI. For more information, please check her filmography.\n\n Is Jorja Fox gay, bisexual or straight?\n\nI don't know, and until Jorja herself states her sexuality, it's not a topic open for discussion. Please respect her privacy as much as you value your own.\n\nIs Jorja Fox single? Is she dating?\n\nIn 2001, Jorja told USA Today she was seeing someone: \"Involved, but not married. I'm not allowed to talk about it at all. I've been sworn to secrecy -- the whole theory that it's more special. I'm very happy and living under a shroud until further notice.\"\n\nHowever in a 2003 interview with People Magazine, she was reported as being single, and that was why she took her brother to the Emmys that year.\n\n Is Jorja Fox pregnant?\n\nNo. Regardless of what you read online elsewhere and hear in rumors, she is not, and has never been, pregnant.\n\nDoes Jorja have any children? Does she want any?\n\nJorja has no children, but she has cats and dogs. I don't know if she wants any children (though she did mention it when talking about why she left CSI).\n\n Is Jorja Fox a smoker?\n\nYes and no. She has smoked, and has tried to quit many times. As of February 2010, she still smoked.\n\nIs she a vegetarian?\n\nJorja Fox became a vegetarian at the age of 19, sometime around her modeling days, and discovered PETA in New York City at about the same time. Jorja told the PETA spokesperson that she took part in a few protests, and enjoyed their \"confrontational\" attitude. She describes herself as an aspiring vegan.\n\n What political party is Jorja affiliated with?\n\nEmphatically not Republican. She's done work with Libertarians and Democrats, but most recently she attended the 2008 Democratic National Convention and supported Barak Obama.\n\nDoes she wear corrective lenses?\n\nJorja wore glasses in a Support SAG PSA in 2008, and in bonus material on CSI DVDs, she wore glasses while re-doing lines in a recording studio. It's likely she just needs reading lenses.\n\n Does she have any tattoos?\n\nYes. She has a flower on her left ankle (seen in the CSI season five episode 4x4 and in various award show and charity photographs).\n\nA temporary/henna tattoo was spotted on \"The Early Show\" for April 28, 2006. On that show, she had what looked like a stylized turtle tattoo high up on her right shoulder. This has not been seen since.\n\nDoes she have any piercings?\n\nJorja has pierced ears.\n\n What pets does she have?\n\nShe had two cats and a dog (Ali (dog, female, Boxer), Rumplestiltskin (cat), and Sid Poitier (cat, male, formerly named Sid Vicious)), all of whom have passed away of old age. In 2012, she adopted a new dog: Bexar County Rodeo Princess.\n\nWhat kind of music does Jorja like?\n\nEverything. As she said in a Yahoo! Chat \"Soul, rock n roll and jazz are probably my favorites.\"\n\n What kind of TV does Jorja watch?\n\nShe watched the first season of Survivor, and she also is a fan of Lost.\n\nDoes she play music?\n\nWhile Jorja is disparaging about her musical talents, she sings and plays the guitar. CSI co-star Gary Dourdan says she plays well. You can hear her sing in the CSI episode Too Tough To Die and also in the movie Food for the Heart. Jorja also wrote and performed a song for the short movie, Traveling Companions, as well as some songs written with the CSI cast and crew. She has performed her music at the several wrap parties for CSI, including after season Four and Season Five. At various times she has had songs that she has written and played on her personal web site.\n\nIn 2005 she reportedly acquired a drum set and was learning to play, and according to an L.A. Times article, she often takes part in a 'drum circle' at Malibu Beach.\n\n Does Jorja play sports?\n\nYes. Jorja and fellow CSI cast member Eric Szmanda were members of the \"Royal Blue Balls\", which is a team in the Adult Kickball League. To stay in shape she jogs, and for personal enjoyment she plays tennis, surfs, swims, hikes, kayaks and goes camping.\n\nDoes Jorja really surf?\n\nJorja has been surfing since she was little and was a self-professed 'surfer girl' in high school. She's surfed in Florida and California, and during the Christmas break in 2006 she went surfing in Puerto Rico. After leaving CSI, Jorja mentioned wanting to surf in South America.\n\nOnce CSI ended, she started surfing more often.\n\n What kind of car does Jorja drive?\n\nA Toyota Hybrid. She also has a bicycle and multiple surfboards."

Will Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway rekindle their romance? Will Dr. Greene finally get over his assault from last season? And, more importantly, will the actors royally flub those lines of long, complicated medical jargon they so convincingly bark out every week? Gay and lesbian viewers might also want to find out what's next for ER's lesbian second-year resident, Maggie Doyle, played by the spunky young actress Jorja Fox.\n\nWhen Fox joined the cast last season as the headstrong resident Doyle, it was readily apparent that, green as she may be, Doyle wasn't one to take crap from anybody. She is a character full of contradictions. She drives a BMW but comes from a middle-class background (her dad's a cop). She seemed flirty enough with handsome fellow resident John Carter (Noah Wyle), but when taking some target practice with him on a shooting range she happened to see one of her ex-girlfriends in a nearby booth firing away. Needless to say that Carter, and ER's viewers, were surprised to hear this news. What will happen to Doyle this season? It's hard to say, but the show's writers seem eager to include her in the mad rush of every episode, so maybe this year we can get to know more about Doyle's life outside the ER.\n\nIn a fun gay-related item, Fox played up her newfound gay notoriety last spring, when she appeared at the end of the now infamous Ellen coming-out episode as a woman who approaches Ellen at the lesbian coffeehouse, only to hit on Ellen's pal, Paige.\n\n",

Completed in 1989 the movie documents the sleazy lowlife of an East Coast nowheresville and its inhabitants who share a common hatred of monstrous bed-ridden gossip Luane (played by Loretta Gross) who terrorizes the town with her tales and accusations. ER semi-regular Jorja Fox features as the naive junkie daughter of the local bar-owner who has half-hopes of escaping to a better existence. Claustrophobic and very slow-paced, The Kill Off makes for grim but worthy viewing.\n\nIt received a limited cinema release in New York City and was screened at the Sundance Festival. Reviews have been overwhelmingly favourable but the film remains largely unknown to most people. It was screened by Channel Four in the UK on May 13 1997. The Kill-Off marks Irish-American cinematographer Declan Quinn's first feature.\n\nSeveral novels from hack pulp-meister Jim Thompson have now been made into films including * The Grifters, *After Dark My Sweet, The Getaway *(twice!) and the French productions *Coup de Torchon , based on Pop.1280 and * Serie Noire, adapted from A Hell of A Woman. Despite the additional dialogue credit, Thompson wrote the screenplay for Kubrick's * The Killing *and had some kind of hand in adapting *Paths of Glory for the same director. Increasingly frustrated and shunned by Hollywood he later wrote scripts for TV sitcoms as his career hit the skids amid chronic alcoholism and illness. He died in 1977 before his books enjoyed a publishing renaissance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReviews\n\n\"The locations are appropriately weathered and run-down and the photography relentlessly grim. The cast, mainly composed of New York stage actors, captures the hopeless meanness of the characters with exceptional conviction, and the score is hauntingly sleazy.\" -* Movie Guide*\n\n\"For her second feature Greenwald almost gets it perfect...she revels in the laconic dialogue, vicious motivations and downbeat mood beloved by Thompson fans...As a thriller however, the movie is short of real suspense: comparison with Blood Simple highlights Greenwald's slow pace.\" - Time Out\n\n\"One of the best adaptations of the work of pulp novelist Jim Thompson this is a film whose low budget works in its favour, evoking the oppressively fatalistic atmosphere at which Thompson excelled. A must-see for fans of film noir.\"\n\nSource:\n\nThe Kill-Off was out of print for several years but Vintage Crime published a new edition in 1998. The film version has significant differences from the novel but of course its always worth checking out the original source material.\n\nCorgi edition 1988",

As writer and director, Kip Koenig exhibits a remarkable sensitivity to the raw energy and sexual and moral confusion of American youngsters today. Drastic cuts, particularly in the midsection, should improve theatrical prospects for a picture that's vastly uneven but holds appeal for the twentysomething crowd, which is likely to connect emotionally with the vibrant ensemble onscreen.\n\nPic recalls, in spirit and ambition, if not in execution, the early comedies of Woody Allen and, more recently, David O. Russell's \"Flirting With Disaster.\" In sharp contrast to the anomie and alienation that mark the youth movies of Gregg Araki and Richard Linklater, Koenig seems more forgiving and tolerant of the various anxieties that beset American youth of the 1990s.\n\nAlmost a female version of the young Woody Allen screen character, protagonist is Bell (Clea DuVall), a bright, neurotic, fast-talking, sexually confused woman. Like Allen's protagonists, Bell periodically steps out of her role and addresses the camera directly, sharing with the audience her innermost feelings.\n\nIn the first, rather deftly scripted monologue, Bell confides the impossibility of realizing New Year's resolutions. Two goals high on her list are to quit smoking and to fall in love. Since the first resolution proves taxing, Bell channels all her energy into achieving the second one - against all odds.\n\nIt doesn't help that she's the least attractive and most problematic of three sisters. Sarah (Jorja Fox), the eldest, is happily married and about to give birth, whereas Dot (Amy Smart), a graceful blonde, is clearly the family's beauty. To complicate matters, Dot has an affair with Bell's ex, Leonard (Gabriel Mann), which increases Bell's insecurities. In an early sequence, Bell takes Leonard to a remote place, begins making love to him in the car and then runs away, leaving the naked man stranded and bewildered.\n\nFinding his way back home, Leonard stumbles into the house of a married couple, Manhattan (Dennis Haysbert) and Christina (\"Secrets & Lies' \"Marianne Jean-Baptiste). In what are the film's weakest scenes, Manhattan engages in endless monologues about fishing, while his unsatisfied wife acts upon her attraction to Leonard, who's the type of handsome, vulnerable guy women find particularly appealing.\n\nAs the story progresses, it seems, as Bell says, \"that I'm smoking more and falling in love less.\" Out of desperation and confusion, she even entertains the idea that she might be a lesbian and goes on a date with a woman. Hysterically rushing from one encounter to another, Bell also deals with her eccentric Uncle Jerry (John David Souther), who's also her teacher, and her laid-back room (Mary Kay Place).\n\nThough the yarn is set in a small college town and the action is confined to a few buildings, \"How to Make\" assumes the logic of a zany road movie, populated by a large gallery of eccentric characters. Problem is, Koenig tries to do too much, throwing more balls in the air than he can possibly juggle. Result is a comedy that's ultimately more exhausting than entertaining. Its happy ending is too cutesy and fake.\n\nThere are not many quiet moments in the movie, but there are too many dull, static episodes that don't pay off. As a comedy director, Koenig needs to learn how to modulate the pacing of the vignettes that form his episodic narrative. Too many scenes are off-key, with a tempo that either drifts lazily or rushes frantically.\n\nIn the lead role, DuVall is well cast as the tomboyish, neurotic Bell, though her performance is occasionally too intensely mannered. The large ensemble is, for the most part, exuberant and enticing, with standout work from Place, Souther and Mann.\n\nRegrettably, two of the cast's most graceful pros, Jean-Baptiste and Haysbert, are burdened with stiff roles that highlight the weaknesses of the picture.",

        "content": "You are two hours from collision with an asteroid, and pirates have disabled your spaceship, seeking the forty billion dollars in cash thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s stuffed in your hold. This is Velocity Trap. It's pretty standard mid-range action science fiction fare that benefits a lot from recent improvements in special effects technology.\n\nWhen watching this film, you must first ask yourself what are you looking for and how are you judging it? If your primary interest in watching films is great acting and a stellar plot, you really ought not to look here first. This one is more about action and special effects than anything else &#8212; and it succeeds fairly well on those counts. The plot is predictable and has holes you could drive any one of the film's starships through. Still, the setting is not too implausible and is at least internally self-consistent. It is also a cut above many other science fiction films because the writers, producers and director appear to be at least aware of the genre in print. I can't count the number of films that claim to be new and original yet are simply inferior rehashes of themes that were first treated in books as far back as the nineteen thirties. Another weakness many science fiction films share is a complete ignorance of basic physics. For anyone in space there is one simple and obvious way to put out a fire. This film uses it. It is refreshing to see a science fiction film without the complete and arrogant ignorance that afflicts so many filmmakers.\n\nOlivier Gruner is an acceptable lead &#8212; I enjoyed the scenes of his interstellar cop Ray Stokes doing ballet in a starship while wearing his long johns for the sheer incongruity. Jorjan Fox also does a good job as Pallas, drawing us into her character from her earliest scenes. It's not a complex character &#8212; few here are &#8212; but she makes us share the other characters' understanding of her. The other characters are little more than plot devices. They do what they need to do in order to move the story along but they don't enhance the film to any degree. Bruce Weitz's spaceship captain is a perfect example of this. His character comes across as a captain, starship, curmudgeonly, model 502B: nothing more or less.\n\nIn short, Velocity Trap's strengths are primarily in its credible science fiction than in its value as a film. This is not to say that it is a perfect example of science fiction &#8212; far from it. But this is a science fiction film that gets enough of the science fiction setting right that a sci-fi fan can watch it without feeling insulted. If you are looking for a basic action flick in an outer space setting you can always give this one a try. The plot may be predictable and full of holes but it does drive the story along.  \n",

That something would appear to be its almost fascistically positive worldview, in which no misfortune or human conflict presents more than token resistance to the jackbooted rule of sweetness and light. Extra points were probably earned by its modish cooking-as-life-metaphor theme and cast full of young actors whose resemblance to more famous stars lends them instant appeal. Unfortunately, The Hungry Bachelors Club's prospects for repeating the success of analogous movies like Like Water for Chocolate and Soul Food are severely limited by screenwriter Fred Dresch's unfocused, hard-to-follow script. Even for those of us raised in the post-Altman era of mandatory multiple plotlines, there's way too much information to comfortably digest. Stressed-out single mom Delmar (E.R. semi-regular Fox) dreams of starting her own restaurant. Lacking the cash, she cuts a $50,000 surrogate motherhood deal with a rich lawyer who's also the boss of yuppie geek Stanley (Provenza), who's stringing along her best friend Hortense (Mara) with vague hints of marriage. The frustrated Hortense, meanwhile, is consoling herself in the arms of sexy deadbeat novelist Marlon (Shackelford), best bud of Delmar's New Agey auto mechanic bro Jethro (Murnik), who's befriended both worldly-wise, gourmet-cooking ex-convict Moses (Nunn), and reforming cokehead Missy (Kendall), who ... well, you get the idea. \n\nThe result of Dresch's efforts to resolve all these plot threads within what Ruzzin clearly views as a character-driven story is a disorienting narrative slalom course racing from one emotion-drenched, morally improving set-piece to another &#8212; with no real sense of what actual events or thought processes are provoking these emotions. There's a similar odd tension among the writerly influences of Thomas and Dresch, resulting in a funky stylistic ragout of Joshua Brand (Northern Exposure), Amy Tan, and Callie Khouri. On the upside, The Hungry Bachelors Club boasts ensemble acting that rivals many of its obvious models. Fox, a pretty serviceable Geena Davis facsimile, does an impressive job of reconciling the tough, tender, humorous and sensual aspects of Delmar's character. The underused Nunn, convincingly aged 25 years beyond his role as Radio Raheem in Do the Right Thing, is equally good as her business partner/soulmate. Still, in the end, this is one of those too-common movies whose luster owes mainly to the reflected glory of its models. Eat, if you're so inclined, but don't be surprised if you're hungry again an hour later.  \n",

        "content": "Starring Jorja Fox, Bill Nunn and Suzanne Mara. Directed by Gregory Ruzzin. Written by Fred Dresch and Ron Ratliff. Produced by Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer. A Mama's Boys release. Romantic comedy. Rated PG-13 for some mature thematic elements. Running time: 91 min.\n\nIntended as a succulent dish spiced with equal parts quirkiness and homeyness, \"The Hungry Bachelors Club\" starts out appetizing enough, but ends as a bland mishmash of conflicting ingredients.\n\nCentral to this goulash is Delmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox, best known for her recurring role on television's \"ER\"), unhappy in her pressure-cooker job as an insurance adjuster. She is a young single mother raising a son while dreaming of using her culinary skills to open a restaurant with her best friend, the romantically conflicted Hortense (Suzanne Mara). Hovering in the girls' orbit are Delmar's anthropologist brother, Jethro, obsessed with vintage Cadillacs; his buddy, good old boy Marlon, who only has eyes for Hortense; and Delmar's mother Hannibal, whose kookiness extends to a series of colorful turbans and a mysteriously wealthy gentleman caller. These supposed misfits are joined by Moses (Bill Nunn in the most well-rounded performance in the film), who is discovered by Jethro and Marlon one night in a car graveyard.\n\nAdapted from a novel by Lynn Scott Myers, the script by Fred Dresch and Ron Ratliff unevenly works in devices unusually focused on motherhood: Delmar's leap at surrogate motherhood, a mother-fixated Southerner, a drug-addled woman whose mother dies unexpectedly at one of Delmar's dinner parties and other foolishness such as a disturbingly stereotyped Arab as Delmar's ex and a silly exercise in Mayan funeral rites. \n\nOf the many problems with \"Hungry Bachelors Club,\" primary is the stunted development of almost all of the characters (who are not nearly as unique or unusual as intended) and the numerous plot threads that dribble off into nothing of consequence. Clearly hoping to recreate the food-as-social-bonder spirit so delectably done in \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" a few years back, \"Hungry Bachelors Club\" (the inevitable and inexplicable name of Delmar's restaurant, as everyone is romantically paired up by that stage) leaves one starved for something more substantial.\n\n",

Opening today at Deerbrook, Lincoln Mall, Randhurst and Yorktown. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with \"The Hungry Bachelors Club\" that it's easy to overlook some of the actors' fine work. It's unfortunate that they're stuck portraying one-dimensional characters who make the \"Melrose Place\" crew appear deep. \n\nDelmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox) is a gourmet chef who toils away as an insurance adjuster. She lives with her mother, young son and best friend Hortense (Suzanne Mara), and dreams of the day when she'll have enough money to open her own restaurant. \n\nOpportunity knocks when Hortense's boyfriend Stanley (Paul Provenza) brokers a deal for Delmar to be a surrogate mother for his boss. If she agrees, she'll receive $25,000, and he'll be promoted to partner. \n\nAfter considering Stanley's promise to marry Hortense when he makes partner and - more importantly - her own desire to quit her job and start up her own business, Delmar says yes.  \nThe only one who opposes her decision is her studly brother Jethro (Peter Murnik), who teaches anthropology by day and restores Cadillacs at night. \n\nThe entire premise of the movie is ridiculous. And because you don't feel a connection to any of the characters, you really don't care whether Delmar gets to open her restaurant, much less whether she'll keep the baby. \n\nJethro's best friend Marlon (David Shackelford) is supposed to be a goofy, lovable character. But after the camera shows him staggering around drunk, revealing rear cleavage three times too many, you've already written him off as an idiot.  \nCouple that with trite stereotypes of a domineering Middle Eastern ex-husband and a chirpy Chinese gynecologist, and you've got really bad comedy. \n\nThe movie's saving grace is the presence of Bill Nunn, who lends a quiet dignity to his role of Moses - an ex-con who falls in love with Delmar. It's unfortunate that director Gregory Ruzzin didn't set the romance up better. \n\nJae-Ha Kim previews film and entertainment highlights every Friday on Channel 32's noon.  \n",

        "content": "Offscreen bonds help the ensemble cast of The Hungry Bachelors Club bring a relaxed emotional honesty to their roles.\n\nIf you glimpsed the title The Hungry Bachelors Club on, say, a movie theater marquee, this romantic comedy might bring to mind a gaggle of frat boys chasing girls and chugging beer.\n\n\"I was afraid of that,\" admitted director Gregory Ruzzin in an interview a week before his film's opening.\n\nBut as Ruzzin and Club's ensemble cast can tell you, once you get beneath the misleading title you'll find a hometown story - about family, acceptance and new beginnings. It is a world where mistakes are forgiven, racial lines are never drawn, friends are dependable and dreams are always within reach.\n\nAnd the food is always delicious.\n\nIf all that seems a little too ideal, Ruzzin doesn't mind the criticism. \"My work has always been about making [the] world a better place by telling stories,\" Ruzzin said. \"Hopefully it rubs off on someone who sits through the movie, even if just a little bit.\"\n\nThe title The Hungry Bachelors Club refers to Delmar Youngblood's (Jorja Fox) dream of opening a restaurant. For years, Delmar's home literally transforms into a hungry bachelors club, where her Cadillac-collecting brother Jethro (Peter Murnik), romantically insecure roommate Hortense (Suzanne Mara) and piano-playing mother Hannibal (Candice Azzara) are the regulars, constantly welcoming both friends and strangers to the feast.\n\nNaturally, Delmar wants to extend her culinary talents and feel-good atmosphere to even more people. However, her Hungry Bachelors Club can't open without adequate funds. An opportunity presents itself when Delmar gets offered $50,000 to be a surrogate mother.\n\nMeanwhile, there's plenty happening elsewhere. Hortense struggles to please her ambitious lawyer boyfriend, Stanley, while slacker writer Marlon (David Shackelford) pines for her. Jethro befriends drug addict Missy (Katherine Kendall) and ex-con Moses (Bill Nunn), who are focused on enriching the world around them after having been given a second chance. And Delmar, with more circumstances than one woman could seemingly handle, falls in love with Moses while feeding everyone well. The food and cooking are an extension of love, according to Ruzzin, who has thrown quite a few dinner parties himself.\n\n\"I grew up in an Italian family,\" Ruzzin said. \"I would go home and I wouldn't leave the kitchen for a week.... So it was not unnatural for me to do this film. I'm famous for little dinner parties on Sunday nights as an excuse to see my friends. You express love for people in your life by feeding them and caring for them.\"\n\nWorking in such familiar territory, Ruzzin didn't quite need influence from other food-themed films like Soul Food and Like Water for Chocolate. The most difficult aspect of the film for the Detroit native and Santa Monica-based director would be crafting its close-knit relationships - and within a small town, to top it off. But Ruzzin got that prepackaged as well.\n\nBy uncanny coincidence, the three lead actresses and old friends - Fox, Mara and Kendall - all found themselves flying to Denver to shoot the film. \"I got offered the role very suddenly,\" said Fox, who plays Delmar. \"In two days, we were on a plane to Colorado. I knew Katherine got offered the role within an hour, and at that point it didn't matter what it was about, but I was going to be making a movie with good friends. It would have to be hard-core porn [for me] not to do it.\"\n\n\"It was the best gift,\" Mara added. \"On most drunken Saturday nights, the three of us would think how great it would be if we all did a film together.\"\n\nThough the thought of simply working together would be enough for the actresses - who saw more of each other at casting calls than movie sets - playing good friends and acting out scenes that reflected their own lives were a doubly rewarding experience. Such a scene had Hortense, who diets profusely to please her boyfriend, confess that she wished to be beautiful and thin like Missy, played by Katherine Kendall.\n\n\"Katherine and I met when we were 17, and we lived together on East 16th Street in New York. I've always hated her and was jealous of her for being so thin,\" Mara said. \"When we had to do the scene, I said to Gregory, &#8216;Let's not even rehearse, let's just do it,' and it came off perfectly on the first take.\"\n\nThat may partially explain how natural and low-key this film feels when done by three friends who used to act in plays together, moved to Hollywood from the East Coast together and founded their own Los Angeles theater company, Honeypot Productions.\n\nBut even their close-knit friendship needed a little push at times in order for it to translate fully on the screen. So Ruzzin was far from a casual observer, sitting back in his director's chair and watching the movie come together by itself.\n\n\"From the top down, the film feels very natural,\" Mara said. \"In one scene between Delmar and Hortense, it just wasn't working, so Gregory (Ruzzin) let us take 45 minutes out of production so we could work on making the story move along. He is an actor's director.\"\n\nAccording to Ruzzin, it is all a symbiotic relationship. \"When I signed on to do the film, the principal casting had been completed, and I was handed these fantastic actors,\" Ruzzin said. \"To have these actresses already know each other and have all the things friends have before they play these parts, it reads much better than what we [would have been] able to create otherwise.\"\n\nBut Ruzzin also had a clear picture in mind of what The Hungry Bachelors Club should be. With several complex storylines, including an interracial romance between Delmar and Moses, surrogate motherhood and the ubiquitous fear of commitment, it's hard to pin down what the film is essentially about; Ruzzin pre-apologizes for getting carried away... showing that he's obviously done his homework.\n\n\"The film shows people caring enough to get involved,\" Ruzzin said. \"Our community nowadays becomes more isolated, more mechanized, [so] that you can shop online and you don't even need to leave your house for anything. Another example is a level of tolerance; we're very intolerant of others' peculiarities. We made sure the fact that Moses is a black man is a non-issue. That's a better message than calling attention to it or we'd still be living in the past. He's also an ex-con and most people wouldn't give him the time of day, but in the film, people recognize his innate quality.\"\n\nKnown for roles in films such as Do the Right Thing, Money Train and The Last Seduction, veteran character actor Nunn signed on because of a friendship with co-screenwriter Fred Dresch, who adapted Lynn Scott Meyers' novel with Ron Ratliff. Playing a \"regular guy\" who happens to be both a talented cook and an ex-con was somewhat of a departure. Taking on a role that wasn't carved from movie stereotypes like a cop or a lawyer, Nunn used his own life experiences and outlook to play a man who slowly discovers that many people out there are willing to help you forge a new beginning.\n\n\"I've actually had that experience,\" Nunn said. \"When family members visit and stay too long, they contribute by pulling their own weight, and Moses pulls it from day one. He's not a burden or a deadweight. The people I helped out thought I was doing them a favor, but they were doing me the favor. I wanted my character to enrich the other people's lives.\"\n\nFox and Mara experienced the same phenomenon with their characters, drawing from their own lives the salient and subtle features that help flesh out an extremely level-headed woman in Delmar and a self-depriving woman in Hortense - not to mention the journey each character experiences within the film.\n\n\"Hortense already has an idea of what she wants her life to be,\" Mara said. \"She wants two kids and she's so insecure with herself. There's a nice arc in the film of her coming of age and becoming a wild woman, where she's tearing into the chicken, letting it touch her lips.\" (Throughout the rest of the film, Hortense doesn't eat anything.)\n\n\"Delmar's trying to hold everything together, and she's just very cool,\" Fox said. \"She knows she's gotta feed her son and fix the plumbing. She focuses on things that could happen instead of daydreaming. I like to think of myself as someone who gets things done.\"\n\nWith characters that seem to exist on a parallel plane with the actors themselves, perhaps Ruzzin's vision isn't too far off from the real world.\n\nPerhaps.\n\n\"The community in the film is something I've tried to create in my own life,\" Ruzzin said, again speaking of his dinner parties. \"The group is just open to who comes in and out, and inviting [new] people in isn't a big issue. There's more than just a societal level, but a culturally diverse one. I live in a white enclave on the Westside and everything is so segregated. Los Angeles is so segregated, it makes me feel uncomfortable because the variety of cultures is what makes life great.\"  \n",

This food-themed film, focusing on thirtysomethings at the helm of change, can be compared to Soul Food and Eat Drink Man Woman with a dash of Like Water for Chocolate. Single mother Delmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox) dreams of opening a restaurant called The Hungry Bachelors Club, so named for the weekly bachelor-littered dinner parties she throws. Without enough money, however, Delmar agrees to \"loan an egg and rent a womb\" to a couple willing to pay $50,000. Meanwhile, her best friend Hortense (Suzanne Mara) is dieting profusely for her lawyer boyfriend - who is supposed to propose - while a writer forcefully pines for her.

You can call it a gumbo of stories - from hot topic issues of interracial relationships and surrogate motherhood to the more ubiquitous fear of commitment and second chances. Absolutely nothing is heavy-handed in this film, almost to a fault, but Greg Ruzzin manages to keep this close-knit community feeling real. The actors also pull off quite a feat, collectively keeping the story funny, involving and dramatic, in a quiet and almost private way, like they're hiding a constantly running stream of consciousness behind their seemingly mundane actions.  \n",

        "content": "Gregory Ruzzin's \"The Hungry Bachelors Club,\" produced by the team that gave us the award-winning documentary \"Waco: The Rules Of Engagement,\" is in many ways a trifle, a low-key romantic comedy about a close-knit group of friendly oddballs who occasionally gather for discussion, companionship and home-cooked meals. Where it rises above the ordinary is in its attempt to address issues of personal consequence &#8212; like infidelity, interracial romance and surrogate motherhood &#8212; even as it maintains its tenuous comic roots.\n\nUnfortunately, those concerns are not always dealt with successfully, due in part to some sluggish writing and the inconsistencies of the main players. Strong characters include Delmar (Jorja Fox), the single mom/earth mother of the group, who dreams of opening her own restaurant someday, and Moses (Bill Nunn), a soft-spoken ex-con whose love of cooking is equal to his passion for old cars. As the circle widens, however, the members become sketchier, including Marlon (David Shackelford), a drunken wannabe novelist who has the extreme hots for Delmar's frustrated roommate, Hortense (Suzanne Mara), whose own biological clock is ticking as she waits for her lawyer boyfriend to pop the question.\n\nChances are that \"The Hungry Bachelors Club\" will drift through theaters for a couple of weeks before showing up on video shelves this winter, but those who are partial to a soothing cinematic Sunday meal of, say, roast chicken and potatoes instead of something more daring may find this gentle tale of love delayed and dreams deferred to be surprisingly satisfying.

Morgan Sheppardbr /\n/PRE\n\nThe Hungry Bachelors Club\" is a low-cal affair in which none of the ingredients are properly measured and the final dish is nothing to give thanks for. Self-styled romantic comedy offers few if any laughs, with only a happy (albeit ridiculous) ending making pica \"comedy\" in literary sense of the word. Ultra-soft approach to a quasi-Altmanesque tale featuring numerous characters in a Southern city severely throttles any B.O. potential for the project, which understandably lured no distribs.\n\nAlthough based on a novel, script by Fred Dresch and Ron Ratliff could still use a compass. Story focus constantly changes amid a crowded roster of characters, and lumpy, bland passages of conversation give way near the end to an absurdly compacted series of unlikely plot twists. Setup, however, suggests a classic comedy situation, as divorcee Delmar (Jorja Fox) and roommate Hortense (Suzanne Mara) stage one of their regular dinner parties for friends and family. Hortense is impatiently waiting for b.f. and rising lawyer Stanley (Paul Provenza) to pop the question, but, instead, Stanley pops one to Delmar: Would she be surrogate mom for his boss and his barren wife?\n\nShe agrees, thinking that fee for her labors will help her open her dream restaurant, the Hungry Bachelors Club. Meanwhile, we're awkwardly introduced to quiet, sweet excon Moses (Bill Nunn), who's sleeping in a derelict Cadillac being sought out by Delmar's bro Jethro (Peter Murnik) and pal Marlon (David Shackelford).\n\nTypical of story's arch notions is character of Jethro, who explains to new buddy Moses that he teaches Mesoamerican anthropology at the local college and restores old Cads with Marlon in his spare time. This character detail comes in oh-so-handy when, back at the party, a guest dies and Jethro and the guys perform a Mayan funerary ritual on the dead woman with her daughter, Missy (Katherine Kendall) arriving in tears.\n\nBefore pic's 93 minutes are up, wads of distracting, tragic backstory are unleashed about Missy, Moses and Jethro, with characters instantly bonding in ways that defy life and good dramatics. Even Delmar and Moses' eventual link-up comes too easily, and the restaurant opening and Delmar's pregnancy go without the least bit of struggle.\n\nWith their pic dramatically walking in its sleep, filmmakers attempt an 11th-hour resuscitation by injecting a nonsensical flurry of plot conflicts in final minutes, including the birth of Delmar's baby, which all are shocked to see is mixed race, meaning that Moses is the father &#8212; which is logically and chronologically impossible.\n\nStronger thesps may have punched up flat material, but the actors here are undone by the flabby script. It should be Fox's movie, and though she's robbed of much screen time, ex-\"ER\" thesp doesn't generate much rooting interest in an indifferent perf. The usually strong Nunn wastes his time in a part that goes nowhere. Only Kendall generates some true moments of passing emotion.\n\nPic would have benefited from greater specificity, starting with identifying the particular Southern city where it's set. Several mediocre Spencer Proffer tunes are sung onscreen, all off-key and shoddily dubbed. Tech credits are just above TV caliber.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 1999 Cahners Publishing Company\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2000 Gale Group  ",

Petersen also serves as a Producer for the series.\n\nOther members of the investigative team include \"Catherine Willows\" (Marg Helgenberger - China Beach), a single parent juggling the job she loves and her family; \"Warrick Brown\" (Gary Dourdan - A Different World) and \"Nick Stokes\" (George Eads - E.R.), who are in head-to-head competition to solve their 100th crime; \"Sara Sidle\" (Jorja Fox - The West Wing), the newest member of the team; and \"Captain Jim Brass\" (Paul Guilfoyle - L.A.

Generally, I'm not very squeamish, but there were thousands of them, including the ones you don't normally see, like maggots. It was intense. \n\n\"To be honest,\" she adds, \"in the beginning, I had to ask myself if I could handle working on this show every day because the content is kinda heavy. It gives you a whole new respect for real-life crime lab experts.\" \n\nThough CSI's graphic tone can be a bit unsettling, it's not nearly as dangerous as Fox's last gig, which ultimately landed her in the hospital. As Gina Toscano, a Secret Service agent assigned to protect the President's daughter on NBC's The West Wing, Fox was run over by a limousine while shooting the season finale. \n\n\"We were filming the assassination attempt scene and everyone had to duck and run,\" recalls Fox. \"I was lying on the ground waiting for the director to yell cut, when I felt something heavy on my leg. I turned just as the wheel of the car was rolling over me.\" As expected, panic ensued and Fox was rushed to the nearest emergency room, where she was immediately recognized for her former role as medical intern Maggie Doyle on ER. \"Luckily, I wound up with just a few bruises,\" she says, \"but the whole thing was pretty hilarious.\" \n\nIn addition to starring on CSI, Fox can be seen in the upcoming indie film Momento, in which she appears opposite Carrie-Anne Moss and Guy Pearce. She's also the co-founder of Honeypot Productions, an independent L.A. theater company. Right now, however, she's focusing all her energy on playing CSI forensics expert Sara Sidle.

By relentlessly analyzing every detail at the scene of the crime, no matter how seemingly irrelevant or grotesque in nature, these sleuths have science and experience on their side to solve the case. \n\nTHEY SAY: \"It's not so much who did it, but how was it done,\" says series creator Anthony Zuiker, who describes C.S.I. as \"Quincy on drugs.\" As exec producer Carol Mendelsohn puts it, \"They're scientists with guns.\" Jerry Bruckheimer, better known for action film spectaculars (Armageddon), says the show \"takes you inside a world I've never seen before\" &#8212; literally inside, as when the camera zooms into a cadaver's chest or intensely magnifies a hair fiber. Zuiker calls these shots \"C.S.I. close-ups, something new and fresh.\" \n\nWE SAY: If only the characters were as animated as the evidence. The detective work is often gripping, but the detectives are mired in clich&eacute;, including the always terrific Helgenberger (China Beach) as a conflicted single mom. Wasting actors like her and Petersen would be a crime. (Jorja Fox, last seen protecting the first daughter on The West Wing, joins C.S.I. in the second episode.) \n\n",

Smoke particles hung in the air, but, three months after an arson, the crime scene appeared cold.\n\n\"There's nothing left, Gris,\" Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) said to his boss, Gil Grissom.\n\n\"More than you think,\" the cerebral Grissom (William Petersen ) responded, already rooting out clues.\n\n\"More than you think\" might as well be the slogan for CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. It drew scant attention before its premiere but has emerged as TV's top-rated new drama, getting about 15 million viewers per week, more than its heavily promoted lead-in, The Fugitive.\n\nThe Friday sleeper has turned forensic science &#8212; the evidence collection and examination that traditionally have served as background on police shows &#8212; into prime time's hot new occupation.\n\n[...]\n\nIf the subject matter is a little ghoulish, so be it, Zuiker and Mendelsohn say. They toned down the gore factor after test audiences blanched at all the blood and bugs ... but only a little. A mass murderer made bloody artwork of his victims in one episode, and well-fed maggots constitute a cast of thousands in tonight's offering: \"Sex, Lies and Larvae.\"\n\n\"My only fear about the job was whether I had the stomach for it,\" jokes Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, an enthusiastic but inexperienced investigator.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "After the promise of the no-budget London thriller Following, *all eyes were on what Nolan would do with a little Hollywood cash. And he certainly hasn't taken the easy road. *Memento **is told with an even more unconventional narrative that keeps your brain in high gear from the very first shot. And it's absolutely brilliant-a terrific little thriller that takes the genre and turns it inside out.\n\nLeonard (Pearce) has a memory disorder: Ever since his wife (Fox) was raped and murdered, he can't create new memories, so he must use a series of Polaroids, notes and tattoos to remind himself where he is, who the people around him are and what he should be doing as he seeks revenge. \"Remember Sammy Jankis\" is his mantra, reminding him of a insurance investigation case from his \"previous\" life involving a man (Tobolowsky) who lost his memory and was cared for by his wife (Harris). But in the present there are lots of people scuttling around him, including a shifty fast-talker (Pantoliano), a victimised woman (Moss) and a vicious thug (Rennie). But who's telling the truth ... and who's using Leonard's disorder to their advantage?\n\nThe film begins with a short backwards scene in which someone gets killed. Then the narrative splits off heading alternatively backwards and forwards in time until we get to the central, climactic scene in which all the loose threads are sorted out with a serious jolt. There are surprises at every turn, and it's no mean feat to keep it all clear. But our attention is rewarded with a stunningly gripping story full of intelligence and wit. Nolan directs superbly, capturing tiny details with clever camera work and design that echo Hitchcock, among others. And as the story unfolds, builds and accelerates, there's a real emotional punch to it all as well. The script is sharp, funny and very astute. And the performances are all first-rate. Pearce holds us right with him in each scene; and it's great to see fine actors like Pantoliano (The Matrix), Tobolowsky (The Insider) and Harris *(Frasier) *shine in roles beyond what we've come to expect. Superb in every way. \n\n*[15-themes, violence, strong language] 11.Sep.00  \n  \nUK release 20.Oct.00*  \n",

Because, to me, it's finally the cop show that nerds have been waiting for.\n\nI don't agree with that. I think it's much more complex than that. I think Billy Petersen's character is a great character. We've never had a character like that before on TV-a guy who is actually really a teacher, and is withdrawn in a way most guys on these shows aren't. I think Jorja Fox's character is just fascinating. I think she's the most fascinating person on TV. That's absolutely my favorite show right now. I was actually quite happy to sacrifice Will & Grace because I think Will & Grace is another show that took a dive this year.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "Jorja Fox is on some kind of new career trajectory.\n\nThe actress moved from E.R., TV's most popular series, to The West Wing, TV's most critically acclaimed. She departed West Wing for C.S.I., the show that has turned out to be this season's highest-rated new drama.\n\nIs it even possible to improve on good fortune like that?\n\nHow about CBS moving CSI next week from Friday nights to Thursdays, where it will follow Survivor: The Australian Outback, almost guaranteeing it a spot in TV's Top 10.\n\n&#8216;Huge surprise'\n\n\"CSI was a huge surprise,\" says Fox, who was hired last summer well after the show began shooting. Canadian actress Chandra West&#8216;s character had been killed off in the second episode, but the producers still wanted the show's forensic investigation team to have a young, female member.\n\n\"I had to make a decision very quickly and not really knowing if (CSI) would succeed,\" Fox was recalling recently, on the phone from her home in L.A.\n\nSo she took the leap. But not the fall.\n\nThe most obvious exit for her West Wing character, the Secret Service agent assigned to the president's daughter, would have been for her to take a bullet in that attempted assassination cliffhanger. \n\nInstead, \"I walked away without a scratch,\" Fox says. \"That's an Aaron Sorkin trick. I guess typically he doesn't write characters out. So I just kind of disappeared into thin air with The West Wing. That's good because there's a door open for me sometime to return.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old has been on the move much of her life. She was born in New York to Canadian parents &#8212; her late mother was a Francophone, her father an Anglophone &#8212; and she grew up speaking \"sort of French-lish.\n\n\"Whatever was easiest to say. Growing up, it was very common that one sentence would be French and the next would be English,\" Fox says.\n\nWhen she was three, the family moved to Florida. At 15, she won a shopping mall model-search contest and began a New York-based career that lasted through her teen years.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I had a real natural gift for modelling,\" she says. \"I was messy and scruffy and a tomboy, so it wasn't something that came as naturally to me as it did to other kids. But to be 18 in Italy having cappuccinos by the ocean getting your picture taken and getting a cheque was quite nice.\"\n\nBreakthrough\n\nDetermined to act instead, Fox bartended, waited tables, worked in a kennel, checked coats at a nightclub. Her breakthrough came playing a rookie cop on Missing Persons, a short-lived 1993 TV crime drama starring Daniel J. Travanti. She joined ER as Maggie Doyle in season three.\n\n\"It was a massive success. It was huge. I was very intimidated by that,\" she says. \"I got the job at seven o'clock at night and I went to work at seven o'clock the next morning. It was good in a way because I didn't have a lot of time to think about how scared I was going to be.\"\n\n",

        "content": "Fox heads the network war and forces CBS ratings to exploit all grounds. No stranger to television &#8212; this brunette meets more than just the average eye.\n\nThursday TV is the talk of two networks: one that hopes it's still on the way up, and one that's trying to halt its slide down. For nearly two decades, NBC dominated Thursday nights with its \"Must See TV\" lineup &#8212; until last year, when CBS' combination of \"CSI\" and \"Survivor\" put the night in play. With both brains and beauty, Fox manages to convey sexiness and sweetness; validating her acting talent she has co-founded Honeypot Productions. Speaking to Jorja Fox, television's most valuable acress since Angie Dickinson, I realized how she has come to symbolize that tough-but-sweet independent woman with her roles. Fox plays \"CSI's\" Sara Sidle, who hails from San Francisco and was brought in by Gil Grissom to investigate the shooting and subsequent death of Holly Gribbs. Since then, Sidle has remained on the team as the new kid on the block, and quickly established a strong reputation for the series.\n\nFox admits she has been lucky to be casted in award winning series, such as \"CSI\" and \"ER.\" \"It's very hard to digest the stardom I have recieved &#8212; it still hasn't sunk in,\" she says. \"It's a miracle I get paid to do what I love most.\"\n\nEver since she was five years old, she wanted to be an actress of a rockstar. \"Even though I knew how to play the guitar, as a child I couldn't get myself on talent shows &#8212; when I got into New Your city I kept getting offers to act for money and I never did becuase of my music,\" Fox says.\n\nGrowing up in Florida's small town, Melbourne, Fox moved to her birth town of NYC upon completion of high school. \"Sometimes your dream is in you and you could manifest your dream without having to leave home, but there are a couple things, such as acting that ultimately find yourself leaving home.\n\n\"Nothing really scared me when I would think of the big city. Also, I was lucky enough to know how to stay safe. Those two things kept me together, and moving to New York was probably the best thing I ever did,\" adds Fox.\n\nShe makes no secret of her chubby-childhood years. Her French-Canadian mother, who grew up around the Great Depression, taught her and her brother the importance of food and the terror of being without it. \"The best possible thing my Mom could say was that her kids had meat on them,\" Fox says, laughing. \"I was a heavy kid, probably from eight to about 16 and it definitely taight me how to be humble.\n\n\"I was lucky because I sprouted. Where I grew up, everyone was lean and blonde. Right around 15, I made a conscience decisions. I wanted to be that lean-fighting-machine.\" A youthful innocent crush led her to take the weight off in pursuit of the class heartthrob's attention. Despite her white-Irish skin, she tried to tan, lost some weight, picked up the guitar for the first time and after the school break she was asked out on a date. \"Immediately I knew he was so far ahead of me &#8212; I was 15 in my brain and he was 23. The guy whom I was head over heels for asked me out a couple of times, and after that we became very good friends.\n\n\"I love bodies &#8212; of all shapes, sizes and ages. It might be hokey, but it's like a fingerprint &#8212; no two bodies are the same. Occasionaly in LA, much more so than NY &#8212; that might be making a sterotype, but &#8212; people can get trapped or petty in what they perceive as perfect in the way they have to look,\" Fox says. nothing is more interesting or sexy to her than all the different ways human beings can impress. When this fair-skinned-chubby schoolgirl left Melbourne, New York immediately accepted her pale skin and dark hair &#8212; instead, she quickly fit in.\n\nConsider continuity: Fox stays true to her career by giving her roles her soul. From a very young age her grandmother told her stories, and Fox's continual interest in storytelling has ranked her a potent actress, although she believes otherwise. \"I am really kind of simple, but this moment, being four months into the taping of the second season, I am more this Sara person than I am myself. She's a lot smarter than I am, much cooler, more adventurous &#8212; obviously I am not. I kind of make believe I am commendable. One thing's for sure &#8212; we both put our feet in our mouths a lot, we both have a lot of heart and we both want to do the right thing by getting to the bottom of the truth,\" Fox says.\n\nBut when Fox is asked about the countless episodes she had with George Clooney on \"ER,\" she begins to laugh and I feel her cheeks blush. \"It was really hard to concentrate,\" she says with a big sigh. \"And, on top of that &#8212; besides him being in the room &#8212; he is always playing practical jokes on people. You are never completely sure what he's going to do. He really is the guy that people describe him as: fun, energetic and down-to-earth. A lot of the practical jokes he would pull on me involed lubricants and plastic gloves.\"\n\nFox has also managed to carve out some impressive film credits including this year's Sundance Film Festival where she portrays the wife of lead Guy Pearce. Directed by Christopher Nolan, \"Memento\" unfolds its story in reverse order. \"This was the most complicated and crazy movie I had ever been asked to perform in. And if I were to be sterotyped &#8212; which I would be grateful if that would happen &#8212; I would like to be know as the gun-totting, intense one,\" she says.\n\nWith \"Memento\" being her third foray into Sundance, her role in the offbeat comedy \"How to Make he Cruelest Month,\" and town gossip queen in \"The Kill-Off\" cannot be forgotten. Although it's a tough question for Fox to answer, she ranks \"How to Make he Cruelest Month\" as her personal favorite &#8212; only because she is very good friends with Clea Duvall, who played her sister. In the latter, she remembers that was the first movie she ever did utside New York.\n\nBut Fox's light doesn't fade with acting or with her &#8216;famous guitar' &#8212; instead, she has expanded by co-founding a production house. With a pleasantly puzzling name such as Honeypot Productions, Fox is interrogated many times for the true meaning behind the name. \"I go way back with the reast of my team &#8212; there are six of us in total and we all live in LA. One day we sat down [and] threw out a couple of names for the company &#8212; we pretty much stayed with [fellow founder] Suzanne [Mara's] idea. It was so sweet &#8212; for us, it was like sugar working together,\" says Fox. Keeping their spirits high, these workaholics work for themselves in this theater venture. Honeypot put up three plays to date, two of which have been scribed by Fox. The fourth play, \"Loving Stanley,\" which she also penned, offers a comedic romp about the women's bowling circut and will soon be released.\n\nFox bemoans pomposity of any sort. As versatile as she is, come this new year, Fox believes she should worry less and chant for world peace.  \n",

        "content": "ER fans know Jorja Fox as Dr. Maggie Doyle. West Wingers may remember her as Secret Service agent Gina Toscano, who saved the life of the president (Martin Sheen) last season. Currently, she's co-starring in CBS's surprise hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But even though she's appeared on three of the hottest shows on television, Jorja Fox is not exactly a household name. \n\n\"I do like to keep a lower profile,\" says Fox, 31, who plays forensic investigator Sara Sidel on CSI. \"It's been really fine for me to just sort of take things slowly and stay working.\" \n\nOn the show, about a team of Las Vegas crime-scene analysts, Fox plays a hard-edged pragmatist who doesn't flinch at the sight of a mutilated corpse. In one episode, for example, Sara takes notes for her boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen) at a bloody crime scene when a police officer becomes too queasy to handle the job. Though her alter ego has a strong stomach, Fox most certainly doesn't. \n\n\"No. I am the wimp of the cast,\" she admits. \"And I think I was the wimp of the cast over at ER, too.\" Fox played Dr. Maggie Doyle, whom she fondly refers to as \"a vegetarian, gun-toting lesbian,\" on the hospital series from 1996 to 1999. \"There were several days on ER where I was nauseous for the duration of the scene.\" \n\nApparently, the mood on the set of CSI's morgue is so jovial that Fox doesn't mind the phony blood and guts that much anymore. \"It's make-believe,\" she says. \"And we have so much fun on the set.\" \n\nMuch of the \"fun\" is derived from Fox and her co-stars &#8212; Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan and George Eads &#8212; joking about the show's gory special effects. According to Fox, a typical on-set quip would be, \"Oh my God, look at that great bullet hole!\" or \"The morgue looks really nice today.\" \n\nFox also enjoys herself when the cast flies to Vegas from L.A. to do location shots. \"I'm not a big gambler, but there's something really, really good about being in Las Vegas and having the excuse that you're working to do all kinds of bad things. If you hit the slot machine with a gin and tonic in your hand, you can say, &#8216;Well, I'm working.' \" \n\nThe high-tech crime-solving methods employed by the CSI team on the show are nothing short of fascinating. So far, the team has found forensic clues in toenail clippings, blood, saliva and other icky substances either left at the crime scene or found in the dead victims themselves. In fact, would-be criminals watching the show may be deterred from committing illegal acts when they see how easily they can be caught by today's technology. \n\nBut Fox has a flip side to that: Criminals could learn a few things from watching CSI as well, like how not to leave clues behind. \"I think we're going to have a lot of viewers from the prison system,\" she jokes. \n\nOn a more serious note, Fox firmly believes in the ability of science to fight crime: \"My good friend's mom was murdered, and it was the scientific evidence that was able to conclude without any doubt that the person that they thought murdered her actually did. In fact, he's in jail.\" \n\nThough the show is high on gore in its depictions of brutal crime scenes, it is low on actual violence. \"It's cool that we're solving crimes without using guns,\" says Fox. \"I'm intrinsically antiviolent.\" \n\nYet, as a crime-scene investigator, Sara does wield a pistol on CSI, as did Gina Toscano on The West Wing. \"Yeah, and Maggie Doyle was really into guns,\" adds Fox. \"So I'm three-for-three on playing women who carry guns.\" \n\nThough she seems destined to play strong butt-kicking women on television, it is a fate Fox welcomes. \"I'm lucky that I've been cast to play these really tough women. My God, if I'm going to be typecast, it couldn't be better to be this type of chick. I love it.\" \n\n",

        "content": "Actress Jorja Fox has been everywhere on the tube-from a three-season stint on ER to a guest role on The West Wing-but she's found a home on CBS' critically acclaimed series C.S.I., playing forensics expert Sara Sidle.  \nFox, 33, spoke with Hollywood.com over the phone from her L.A. home to discuss her role on C.S.I., the upcoming Emmys ceremony, the success of ER and the joys of nudity.\n\nJorja, you're a busy girl these days. Thanks for taking some time off from that grueling damn schedule of yours to talk with us.\n\nFox: Hey, I love these phone interviews. They're so much more stream-of-consciousness, ya know?\n\nAnd more laid back.\n\nFox: Oh yeah. I could be half naked right now.\n\nYeah, me too. Well, that aside, tell me how early production's going on the show.\n\nFox: Great! I'm really excited. It's good to be back.\n\nDoes the show seem to be going in any different directions this season?\n\nFox: They've only shown me one script, so I'm not sure yet. But the first episode is great. There's a big plot twist in there.\n\nLast season, your character, Sara, played a fairly supporting role on the show. Is she going to break out a bit more this season as a major player?\n\nFox: [Sighs] I don't even know. I hope so. But everything's a secret right now, so....\n\nWell, one main character, Marg [Helgenberger], certainly received some recognition this year, snagging an Emmy nomination for best lead actress. What do you think of her chances?\n\nFox: Oh, we're all pretty giddy, that's for sure. She deserves it. The show got three nominations, I believe. I think one was a tech nomination.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you guys win, it's still a damn good reason to get dressed up and schmooze.\n\nFox: Yeah, and it's good that Marg got the nomination because she's definitely the best dresser of anyone on the show. Me-I'm more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl, ya know? Both me and George] [Eads, who plays Nick Stokes on the show] are like that. Man, we tie for last place in the best-dressed department.\n\nOne show you used to work on, *ER*, got a handful of nominations as well. Do you think the show is better or worse since you left in '99?\n\nFox: I disagree with people who put down the show today. I mean, it's the number-one show on TV, ya know? It has been for years. That's such a challenge to stay on top, and they've done it every time. It's still a great show.\n\nEver miss it?\n\nFox: Sometimes. But on C.S.I., the atmosphere's not so different, ya know what I mean? The sets still have that metallic look. The labs and everything.\n\nVery true. It's not such a departure after all. And *C.S.I.*&#8216;s amassing quite a fan base, I hear.\n\nFox: Oh, god yes. These fans are amazing. The show's really developed a following with students-you know, forensic students. They've really latched on.\n\n*I guess most people still recognize you for *ER, but you recently made an appearance in one of the year's best films, Memento. Any further big-screen plans? **\n\nFox: That was fun, definitely. I love movies. There may be a project coming up with Josh Leonard-you know, the guy from The Blair Witch Project? A short film. But right now it's C.S.I. all the way.  \n",

        "content": "Jorja Fox speaks for many of us trying to work while also worrying about current events.\n\n\"I go from moments where you don't want to come to work, to being very focused and concentrating, knowing there is something I've got to do, to other moments when I can't seem to get it together,\" said Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on CBS' hot sophomore drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\n\nIn the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, *CSI *went dark for a week, and producers pulled an upcoming episode that didn't involve terrorism but showed a small plane crashing into a casino.\n\nWhen shooting resumed, Fox found comfort in \"having a place where I had to go and something I'm supposed to do.\"\n\nClearly, Fox was ready for CSI. But what about the rest of America?\n\nHigh ratings indicate that Americans are craving entertainment, both drama and comedy. CBS' Everybody Loves Raymond, NBC's Crossing Jordan, *ABC's *Philly *and Fox's *Undeclared all received strong samplings this week, ratings show.\n\nBut forensic science may not be what the public wants to see right now.\n\n\"We're obviously concerned whether people are going to want to turn to that for entertainment right now,\" Fox said. \"We don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nOn tonight's season premiere (8 p.m., Channel 11), the son of an entrepreneur who helped build Las Vegas is found in his home, dead of an apparent drug overdose. But as the CSI team studies the scene, murder comes to be suspected, and every member of the forensic team is assigned to the case.\n\nThe episode was not available for preview, but if the show continues to exhibit hallmarks from its freshman series, it should go gangbusters again. As viewers have discovered, *CSI *is a mix of provocative plot lines, compelling performances by an ensemble cast and an irresistible Las Vegas locale.\n\nFox's character, Sara, is as straightforward and complex as any on the show. Her compulsion for her work strongly suggests trauma in her past.\n\nBut like another strong drama series, NBC's Law & Order, *CSI *does not dwell on the lives of the principal characters. It focuses instead on the cases. So we don't know exactly what drives Sara.\n\nEven Fox is not clear about Sara's past.\n\n\"I may have alluded to the fact that there may be things in her personal life that definitely directed her to the profession that she's in,\" Fox said. \"It's not necessarily that she was the victim of something, but perhaps she was very close to someone, a family member (who was a victim).\n\n\"One thing about us, we were very plot-driven last year, and I think we're going to stay plot-driven. Certainly the first six shows of the year are all about plot. There are tiny, tiny pieces of character in the shows. Our hope is that people always want to know more about the characters (than is revealed). It's fun that way. You keep an air of mystery about yourself. It's fun to play.\"\n\nFox (her first name is pronounced \"Georgia;\" it's a shorter version Jorja-Ann, the name given her by her French Canadian mom) is the person you want to stand next to during a lightning storm. Her credits include three seasons as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, *a stint as a Secret Service agent on *The West Wing and now a role on CBS' top drama. She was the murder victim in the much-heralded movie Memento.\n\n\"I think it's just been a series of personal miracles,\" Fox said. \"I do feel so very lucky about that.\n\n\"The only thing I know is that if I feel really nervous about a decision I'm about to make, it usually means I should pursue that decision. And all three of those (TV) shows, there was something about them that made me really nervous.\"\n\n",

I was obviously a little nervous about all three shows.\n\nWhich show have you enjoyed starring in most?  \n  \nIt would have to be CSI. It's a fundemental leap into the \"great unknown.\" And that's created an amazing, strange, wild, 150 member family.\n\nIs *CSI* ever based on real occurrences? Real Crimes?\n\n  \nSometimes. We try very hard to tell those stories with integrity.\n\nWhich actors/actresses have you enjoyed working with most?  \n  \nit would be easier to try and hone in on who I've not enjoyed working with. I've been very lucky. I have a cerebrial crush on William Peterson. And certainly Martin Sheen and Allison Janey, are personal heros.\n\nWhat would be your ultimate role?  \n  \nI really just love getting to tell stories.

We do stuff we've always just wanted to do, and things people might not pay us to do - theater under the stars, musicals, we did a dance piece - So far all our projects have been internally written.

Favorite designer?\n\n  \nUrban decay - I've always been underdressed - I try and I try - but I'm intrinsicly messy.

A bunch of healthy-looking, Anytown, USA-dwelling white people, whose tiny, tinny lives remain in the general orbit of a divorced mom named Delmar (played by ER's Jorja Fox, who resembles a more robust Julianne Moore), occasionally convene over fabulous home-cooked meals to furrow their brows about nothing in particular. One night, Delmar's Cadillac-collecting, anthropology-teaching, Mayan shamanism-practicing brother, Jethro (Peter Murnik, a hunky Harry Connick Jr. type), and his affably drunk pal, Marlon (David Shackelford, whose ass-crack is the film's idea of \"funny\"), find a black ex-convict (Bill Nunn, who deserves better) sleeping in the back of a car. Without hesitation, the whole ensemble adopt him as their new best friend. The rest of the plot &#8212; something about surrogate mothering, evil lawyers, and a restaurant that shares the film's title even though all its customers come in couples &#8212; is as undernourished as its characters are stuffed. Blissfully uninvolved with the realities of American race relations, this spineless feel-good nonsense means to warm the cockles of your heart. Somebody check the oven: My cockles were charred.  \n",

SHARON RAINSBURY visited the set of Nine's CSI and spoke to series' stars william Petersen and Jorja Fox. IT is 8.30am on Monday morning, but the Las Vegas criminalistics bureau is already a hive of activity. Uniformed police officers come and go through the front door as two cars pull up outside the grey building. \n\nLead crime scene investigator Gil Grissom is climbing out of his car when colleagues Sara Sidle and Warrick Brown pull in next to him. \n\n\"How'd it go at the college?\" Grissom asks, leaning in the open passenger window. \"They're not co-operating,\" Sidle replies. \n\n\"We didn't have a warrant. Got kicked out,\" Brown adds, before the conversation is cut short when a loud voice interjects from the sidelines. \n\nFrom behind a mobile monitor, director Peter Markle is watching the action play out on the screen in front of him, and he is not happy with what he sees. \n\n\"Let's do it again,\" he cries, as the actors return to their positions at the start of the scene.

        "content": "The increasing presence of motion picture producers and directors in television is turning prime time into an unwatchable mess of PG-13 and even R-style mini-movies. Prominent names such as Joel Silver (The Matrix, Lethal Weapon) and Kevin Williamson (Scream) have already brought their big-screen values to small-screen series. Now add Jerry Bruckheimer (Coyote Ugly, The Rock) to the list. He serves as executive producer for CBS' grim CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the highest-rated new drama of the season and the only new show nominated for a Golden Globe \"Best Series\" Award. He also serves up some of television's rawest images.\n\nCSI's stomach-churning shock value was best described by one of its stars, Jorja Fox. \"I get nauseous just thinking about some of the things I've seen on the set,\" she told TV Guide. \"We recently did an episode in the woods where we come across a murder victim covered with bugs &#8212; real ones. Generally, I'm not very squeamish, but there were thousands of them, including the ones you don't normally see, like maggots. It was intense. To be honest, in the beginning, I had to ask myself if I could handle working on this show every day because the content is kinda heavy. It gives you a whole new respect for real-life crime lab experts.\"\n\nYes, CSI does give viewers an appreciation for those dedicated public servants who sift through police evidence. It has also spoken out against rape, drug abuse, domestic violence, incest and violent crime. But it creates an unintended quandary: Should families entertain themselves by ingesting graphic images of medical autopsies, brutalized bodies, blood-spattered sets and decomposing corpses? \n\nTwenty years ago on Quincy, Jack Klugman described the murders he uncovered each week. CSI shows theirs. From every angle. Over and over again. A drug-crazed raver strangles his friend. A woman caves in a man's skull with a rock. A man shoots himself in the head. A teenager stabs an entire family to death with a kitchen knife. The detectives are fond of saying that blood \"talks.\" It also flies, drips, runs and pools on the floor. CSI is ugly, exploitative, gross, disrespectful of the dead and, unfortunately, enormously popular among the living.  \n",

        "content": "\nNo stranger to television, Fox also starred on NBC's top-rated series \"ER\" as resident intern Dr. Maggie Doyle prior to her segue as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on Aaron Sokin's Emmy Award-winning drama, \"The West Wing.\" Additional credits include guest turns on \"Law and Order\" and the historic coming out episode of \"Ellen.\"\n\nFox has also managed to carve out some impressive film credits that includes this year's Sundance Film Festival dramatic competitor \"Memento.\" This marks Fox's third foray into Sundance. She has previously made the trip in conjunction with her roles as sister to Clean Duvall in the quirky comedy \"How To Make The Cruelest Month\" and as the town gossip in \"The Kill-Off\" which was based on the book by renowned author Jim Thompson (\"The Grifters\"): More recent feature credits include the comedy \"Forever Fabulous\" with Jean Smart and &#8216;Down With The Joneses' opposite Joshua Leonard (\"The Blair Witch Project\").\n\nHaving appeared in numerous stage productions, this New York born actress continues to work tirelessly in conjunction with the theater company which she co-founded, Honeypot Productions.\n\nThe following is an up-close and personal interview.\n\nChaunc&eacute; Hayden: You've starred on \"ER,\" \"West Wing\" and now \"CSI.\" All three have been huge hits. Are you just lucky or is your agent a genius?\n\nJorja Fox: (Laughs) Yeah, it's been crazy. With \"ER\" and \"West Wing\" the difference is that they were already humongus hits when I got the job to be on them. But \"CSI\" is a nice surprise. I mean when the first show airs you just hope that all your friends will watch it.\n\nThere are so many bad shows today. I mean some are really horrible. Don't you agree?\n\nYeah. The same thing is going on with movies. I think films have a really short window to be successful. There's just so much to chose from it seems.\n\nThe critics say the \"CSI\" pushes the boundaries of what we're used to seeing on network television.\n\nThat's true. I also think what makes \"CSI\" a hit is that it's a story that hasn't been told that much. So hopefully it's a little different.\n\nFor people that haven't seen \"CSI\" how would you describe the premise?\n\nThe premise is that we're the people that come in to a crime scene who aren't cops. We're scientists'. And when something happens and there's pieces of the puzzle missing and they're trying to figure out what could of possibly happened to some poor person they call us in. We're crime scene investigators who specialize in forensic science and criminology.\n\nWould it be fair to call \"CSI\" a spin off of the \"X-Files\"?\n\nI'm a huge \"X-Files\" fan, so I love all those elements about \"CSI\" that could be compared to the \"X-Files.\" But we don't' dabble that much in mysticism. But of course that door is always open because we're dealing in the unknown.\n\nSome of the episodes are based -fairly loosely on true stories. Actually, I just finished a show yesterday where a tech advisor wrote the script of an incident that actually happened to her in real life. I can't tell you what it is yet but I will tell you that it was really cool to do knowing that this event really happened to somebody.\n\nI like how you spell your name by the way, Jorja.\n\nThank you! My mom made it up.\n\nSo that's your real name?\n\n(Laughs) Yes!\n\nWhy did you leave \"ER\" when it was doing so well?\n\n\"ER\" kind of just fizzled out. There was some room for me to come back, but I thought they had played out the story with me.\n\nI heard Eric LaSalle is really hard to work with. Well?\n\n(Laughs) Did you know he's a black belt in karate? He really is a very grounded guy and I think that can be intimidating to a lot of people. But he's really really nice. What I loved most about Eric LaSalle was that he and I weren't that great at the technical stuff back when the show first aired. So we were always having to do extra takes to figure out that medical terminology.\n\n*He actually told me that. Well you both convinced a lot of people that you actually knew what you were talking about. *\n\nMost of the time! In fact it got so bad that friends starting calling me asking me what to do for a headache. I would just say, \"I don't know! Go to a doctor!\"\n\nDo people really expect you to know how to treat their medical problems just because you play a doctor on TV?\n\nOccasionally! Which is very funny to me! One time there was an accident on the road and thank God nobody was hurt. But this guy was hit by a car so I stopped and called 911 and waited for someone to show up. And when the Paramedic pulled up he said hi to me like he knew me as a fellow paramedic. But then he realized I really wasn't.\n\nDo people usually recognize you on the street?\n\nYeah, sometimes that happens. I wouldn't consider myself famous really. But occasionally people will talk to me and be really nice. I find that very flattering.\n\nIs it true that you also appeared on the very last episode of \"Ellen\" with Ellen DeGeneres?\n\nYeah! It wasn't really the last show but it was the one hour long coming out show that I was on.\n\nDid you play a lesbian on the show?\n\nI had a small cameo and yes it was as a lesbian. Toward the end of the show Ellen drives to a lesbian bar for the first time in her life. Once she's at the bar I approach her but instead of asking Ellen out I ask her friend out. So, the joke was, even as a lesbian, Ellen still couldn't get a date.\n\nI always thought it was a big mistake for Ellen to come out. Her career took a nose dive right afterwards. In fact I was really surprised that her show didn't work after she came out. If anything I thought it would help.\n\nI was surprised too. I was actually really proud to be a part of that historic episode. I think it was really bold and cool for her to do it. There was so much pressure on her. Actually my character on \"ER\" was gay. That's why they asked me to be on that special \"Ellen\" episode. That show was full of so many huge celebrities, Jay Mohr, Billy Bob Thorton, Opra Winfrey and so many others. I couldn't believe I got to work with so many talented people.\n\nSo why didn't the lesbian angle work for Ellen?\n\nI don't know? But it didn't open the flood gates for shows like \"Will and Grace.\"\n\nI agree. Before I let you go, I have to ask you this. Is it true you were run over by a limousine?\n\n(Laughs) Yes! How did you know that?\n\nI have my sources. It happened while you were doing \"West Wing.\"\n\nRight! I was run over by the presidential limousine! It was the last night of last season's show. We were shooting the scene where we all had to duck and run because the bullets where coming at us. It was very choreographed. We did it a couple of times and everything seemed fine. So I was lying face first on the ground then all of a sudden I felt something very heavy on my leg. So I turned around and it was this weird limousine running over my leg. I was really lucky I didn't break anything.\n\nDid you cry? I would have.\n\n(Laughs) I think a part of me is still in shock over it. I was shocked that it happened and shocked that I walked away from it. It was very strange.\n\nIs that why you left \"West Wing\"?\n\nNo! It just seemed that \"CSI\" came out of nowhere and I was very interested in it. Plus I thought the story line to \"West Wing\" might of played itself out. Plus it's not really about the secret service people anyway. Being one of the secret service people on the show I just didn't think my character had too much room to grow. But it was really a lot of fun to be a part of such a great show. I'm a hardcore liberal person and I liked that on the \"West Wing\" the good guys win. I experienced a lot of joy being a part of that show.\n\nWell I don't think anyone would disagree that you made the right choice moving over to \"CSI\". The show is the most watched show on television. Three shows, three hits. You're batting a 1,000.\n\nThanks! I'm just lucky I guess!  \n",

        "content": "CSI's Jorja Fox is out for truth, justice and a steady job\n\nThis week, Jorja Fox returns for a second season of the CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as determined detective Sara Sidle. This is big news- her previous characters have had a habit of disappearing from top-rated shows. \n\nFive years ago, on ER, Fox played Maggie Doyle, the lesbian pediatrician who pissed off nurses and colleagues, then wandered off the series when the writers couldn't find anything more for her to do. \"Maggie was like a ghost,\" says Fox. \"She just kind of poofed away.\" Three years later, on The West Wing, Fox played Special Agent Gina Toscano, who survived an assassination attempt on the President (Martin Sheen) but might as well have taken the bullet herself. \"I asked to leave,\" says Fox. \"I had [another possible show] I was excited about.\" \n\nWhile that one never happened, Fox, 33, did find herself on CSI; last year, the freshman crime drama, which follows a group of crime scene detectives in Las Vegas, was second only to ER in the ratings. And Fox is staying put, even though she didn't expect to be here at all. Asked if she thought the somewhat corny show would become a monster hit, she answers: \"Um... honestly?\" \n\nBorn in New York City but raised in Melborne, Florida (her Canadian parents dreamed of living near the beach), Fox was discovered in a model search at age 16 at the local mall. Not conventionally beautiful?she was \"a fat kid with new wave punk-rock hair\"-she soon moved to New York and gravitated toward acting. After roles in straight-to-video movies and flops like The Jerky Boys, she scored an audition for ER. Since then, she's played strong-willed characters who usually have attitude (although she did have a cameo in Memento as Guy Pierce's loving wife). On CSI, her antisocial detective Sidle spends more time with dead bodies than real ones. \"Friends and family always say, &#8216;You never smile,' and I'm like, &#8216;It's really hard to smile. I'm standing over someone who's met a horrific end!'\" \n\nTo lighten up her life, last year, Fox founded Honeypot Productions, an acting troupe that puts on the comedic plays she writes. She says she finds the CSI scripts a little goofy in comparison (in one episode, a man is killed by his frat buddy because the latter's girlfriend autographed the former's \"johnson\"). \"There's always something funny and macabre, but we're also dealing with this highly sensitive, dark material. So to meld that together is a great challenge.\" \n\nShe thinks this season's scripts will continue to walk that line and prays last season's success wasn't a fluke. \"We're hoping people don't get bored with it,\" says Fox. \"Every week, somebody's dead and we try to figure out what happened to them. So you have to wonder if it will get stale.\" Don't expect her to stick around if it does. \n\nThe second season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation begins September 27 at 9pm on CBS. \n\n",

On ER, Fox played cranky medical intern Maggie Doyle, on The West Wing she played the recurring role of Secret Service agent Gina Toscano. Now, on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Fox is the new kid on the block as Sara Sidle, a crime-scene analyst who seems about as unfazed as Agent Scully while picking through blood and guts. As gross as that sounds, we have to admit there's something sexy about a woman who can stomach the tough stuff ... and knows how to back a winner.\n\n",

That was when I was 16, so I have no idea if it's still there or not.\n\nWhat did you have to do?  \nI would feed the dogs, and I'd take them from their little hotels to these indoor dog runs. In New York City, the insurance for kennels to walk dogs outside was so expensive that they would walk the dogs inside. It was a great job &#8212; I loved it.\n\nWhat was the best thing about that job?  \nI loved my clients. (laughs)\n\nWas there anything really bad about it?\n\nNot really. For the most part it was just me, and I could listen to music, and I could wear whatever I wanted?it was just a great, great job.\n\nSo how many dogs do you have now?  \nI have a dog named Ali &#8212; she's a boxer &#8212; and two cats named Rumplestiltskin and Sid Poitier. I didn't name them, though; they came with those names. In fact, Sid was originally named Sid Vicious, but when he started to act too much like his namesake, I changed his name to Sid Poitier.\n\nDid you learn anything at that job that's stuck with you?  \nI learned a lot. I learned some discipline, because I had to be there very early in the morning; I learned how to work on my own; and I learned a lot about compassion.\n\nYour character on *C.S.I.* sees a lot of dead people. Have you ever had a job where you saw dead people?\n\nWhen I was 15, I volunteered at an emergency room in Florida, and there were a couple times when people passed away.\n\nEver had a job that made you dead tired?  \nYeah, C.S.I. I love it so much, but I'm burnt. I think this summer I'm just going to sleep late.\n\nWhat was your first paid acting gig?  \nI did this independent movie called The Kill-Off in 1989, but then it was another full year before I got another job.\n\nThe clich&eacute; about actors is that they've all worked as waiters. Did you?  \nI did everything in clubs and bars, though I only worked as a waiter one night when someone was sick. But it was such a disaster that they never had me do it again.\n\nBefore you hit it big, what was your favorite cheap meal?  \nPizza. In New York, especially, I had this idea in my head that I was a pizza connoisseur, so I tried to try every pizza place in the city.\n\nDo you still eat a lot of pizza?  \nYeah, when I'm in New York.\n\nIf you hadn't become an actress, what would you be doing today?\n\nI would've loved to have gotten involved in politics. Not necessarily as a politician, but maybe as someone working behind the scenes.\n\nSo what advice would you have for someone looking for their first job?  \nLook for something that really interests you, be yourself, and trust that the day will come when people will listen to you.\n\nC.S.I. airs Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m. on CBS.\n\n",

        "content": "\nIssue Date: June 17, 2001\n\nOnline extra: Q&A with actress Jorja Fox of \"CSI\"\n\nJorja Fox, \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" forensics investigator Sara Sidle, has a knack for landing in the hot show of the moment. Her face is familiar to viewers of both \"ER\" and \"The West Wing\", on which she had recurring parts as a doctor and secret service agent respectively. Patty Rhule caught up with her on the final week of filming \"CSI\", the CBS hit with a remarkable debut season.\n\nQ: Did the bloody scenes on \"ER\" prepare you for what was ahead on \"CSI\"?  \n  \nI'm the wimp of the cast and I am a little squeamish. Just when I think it's going away, it's not. When I met (star and producer) Billy Petersen and the creator (Anthony Zuiker) for lunch, I sit down and order this delicious lunch and they immediately start talking about heads in popcorn containers. I was turning green. But I thought, if I act too wimpy, they might have second thoughts about me. We just did an episode (where) we find a skinned torso in the desert. Just when I thought I was over it the special effects guy kept pouring fresh blood over it so it was nice and shiny.\n\nQ: How do you handle that? Eat a dry cracker?  \n  \nI just breathe through it. I wait and eat after the scene is over.\n\nQ: You have been in \"ER\", \"The West Wing\", and now \"CSI\" and the cool movie, \"Memento\". What's your secret?\n\n  \nObviously, I feel unspeakably lucky. I just sort of fell into these things. With West Wing and \"ER\" I knew they were runaway hits. \"ER\" I came to in episode 3 &#8212; it was sort of terrifying. But nothing really compares with the excitement of \"CSI\". We shoot in the country outside L.A. You have faith in something and hope it's going to do well. To watch this year unfold, I don't really have words for it. I've been crying for the past couple of days, because it's amazing. It's going to be an excellent year. I only worked on \"Memento\" for a couple of days (as the dead wife). I get to be that sort of objective person, 'cause I'm not in it very much.\n\n*Q: Are you getting more movie work over hiatus? *\n\n  \nNot really movie roles. Schedule-wise, there wasn't a tremendous amount of time. I kind of made a decision to rest and relax. A close friend is doing a short film: it's four or five days (work).\n\nQ: You've hinted that there is more to be revealed about your \"CSI\" character.\n\n  \nI think it's going to be like snapshots, they will very slowly reveal things about all of us and the hope is people will always want to know more about us. Nothing too specific, but she's got a skeleton or two in her closet. We're having a meeting with writers ... to hash out all kinds of ideas for next year. That's something that's really special about the show. It really is very collaborative.\n\nQ: So you'll do your friend's film over break?  \n  \nA short film. I have a little theater company with some friends and this is our first foray into film; we're shooting on 35 mm. I've written some plays and produced one or two.\n\n*Q: How much time do you have off? *\n\n  \nAbout two months. There'll be a couple of big publicity things in early July. In the next couple of weeks, I'm not that good for anybody. It's the happiest tired in the world, but it's almost a little useless.\n\n*Q: Do you have travel plans? *  \n  \nI have huge big travel dreams, haven't decided on a place yet. I'm going to New York, where I'm from, going to do a little bit of charity work for the ASPCA. They're a really good organization. I know it's involving water. It could be the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe, it could be anywhere. I look at the pictures every day.\n\nQ: You're a fan of the ASPCA. Do you have pets?\n\n  \nI have a dog and two cats. My dog comes to the set with me sometimes. If I'm in one scene in a day, she has a great time. George Eads brings his dog every day. That's one thing that's nice about shooting out of town. When we're in L.A., we're in the Valencia area, 45 minutes north. (Other times) we go to Vegas. I love Vegas. It's very special to be there, it's such a specific city, a beautiful, moody, dark place, it's so good for us when we're there. It's very helpful. The only bad thing about Vegas is that it doesn't close. And I'm a terrible gambler. And it's very difficult not to gamble when you're there.\n\nQ: Where did you get the unusual name?  \n  \nMy parents are from Montr&eacute;al. (It's common in French) the j was a twist on it. I'm a child of the '70s. It's my given name ... until I was about 10 everybody tried to tell me how to spell it.\n\nQ: Are you a computer user?\n\n  \nNo one has a DSL line at work. We get in there (to the office computer) and just about when you're really comfortable, they come in to do some work-related thing. I'm a pretty big computer person, but it's suffered alot already.\n\n*Q: Have you seen the fan websites? *  \n  \nI don't see them that often. I was really flattered and amazed.\n\nQ: Are you a married person, a single person?\n\n  \nInvolved, but not married. I'm not allowed to talk about it at all. I've been sworn to secrecy &#8212; the whole theory that it's more special. I'm very happy and living under a shroud until further notice.\n\n",

Tell me about Jorja Fox, one of the forensic investigators.   \nRoseanne Turner, Denver, Ind.\n\nShe has a talent for being in the show of the moment: Fox, 32, was in ER early on, The West Wing last year and now CSI, plus the acclaimed indie movie \"Memento\". The New York native is unmarried but \"involved, and not allowed to talk about it. I've been sworn to secrecy!\" She can talk about her love of animals (she has a dog and two cats); she headed back to New York on her break from CSI to work with the ASPCA. \"I'm the wimp of the cast, a little squeamish,\" she says when asked about her gruesome scenes. \"When I met [co-star] Billy [Petersen] and the creator [Anthony Zuiker] for lunch, I order this delicious lunch and they start talking about heads in popcorn containers.\"\n\n",

        "content": "*There's a line in *Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, where Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential), as tormented lead character Leonard Shelby, is asked, \"What's the last thing you remember?\" He says, \"My wife.\" But the sum of what he can piece together from his injury-induced chronic loss of short-term memory is \"the feel of a person.\" Jorja Fox, who suffers a Psycho-like death and haunts the film as Shelby's memory of his murdered wife, does exactly that on the screen: creates the feel of a person. It's this instinctive ability to mine the white space on a page of dialogue that really calls attention to a Jorja Fox performance. While you may not have her name on the tip of your tongue at the moment, the surprise hit show \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (CBS) may be the platform that will launch this young actor into the national consciousness.That's because Jorja is doing something with her craft that isn't seen a lot: she's not only acting, she's listening. And the actor's reference points are \"personal.\" Born in New York, but raised in the small Florida town of Melbourne Beach, Fox's path into the profession reads like a teen fantasy. Local girl enters a modeling contest with friends; wins the contest despite the just-rolled-out-of-bed tomboy look; ends up on photo shoots in Europe; retires by the age of 18; decides to act. Then she gets cast to do guest spots on shows like \"Law and Order\" and \"Ellen\"; stars in NBC's huge hit \"ER\" and moves on to the Emmy award-winning series \"The West Wing.\" And now it's \"CSI,\" where she plays the gung-ho junior member of the investigative team, forensics investigator Sara Sidle.\n\nThat's not including her indie credits: Forever Fabulous, Down With the Joneses, and, of course, Memento, where she gets to be a corpse not unlike the ubiquitous bodies that people the storylines of \"CSI.\" But the CBS show offers something more than a mystery to solve with each episode. Starring William Petersen (who also produces), Marg Helgenberger, George Eads, and Gary Dourdan, \"CSI\" is about healing, about coping with the enormous violence all around us. \n\nIronically, in her last season on \"The West Wing\" she was a near-casualty, literally run over by an armored limousine. \"Not just a limo, a two-ton Presidential limo.\" Luckily, she survived the errant tire and actually wanted to keep on working despite the bruises. But that just speaks more to her post-Modern appeal, the rare combination of gritty realism tempered with genuine optimism in the face of challenging times. Coming from a place of honesty, Jorja Fox is on the trail to find her destiny, and the public is getting a clue about what this girl can do.\n\nVenice: So one day you found yourself having a cappuccino in Italy, being a teen model. That must have been culture shock.\n\nJorja Fox: I thought, &#8216;What the hell am I doing in Italy?' Culture shock was moving to New York! I was a terrible model; I just wasn't that person. It was better in Europe than New York. I would get out of bed and not brush my hair.\n\nI wanted to be an actress from a young age. Part of the reason [I did modeling] was that it was an opportunity to go to New York City. It was great-coming from this small town. I studied at Lee Strasberg Academy ... also with Bill Hickey (Prizzi's Honor).\n\nWilliam Hickey was a great actor. \n\nHe's dead now. Nobody could believe he was teaching classes down at this place in the village. He was very ethereal and would go around stuff. Other acting teachers would say, \"You're forcing it.\" He would just tell a story-about a vineyard in Ireland, and it would all make sense. I loved his class.\n\nWhat did you see as a career trajectory?\n\nI tried to play down the modeling thing, like a model who wants to be an actor. People look at that with a snicker or a grin. I retired at 18. It was kind of funny. I wouldn't trade it for a second. I was also playing music at the time. I had two loves: acting and music.\n\nHad you been doing indie films all the while you were doing TV?\n\nThe first job I ever got was an indie movie. I sort of chased movies for a long time, but TV offered opportunities. I still love movies. [At first] I really liked movies over TV; now that's changed. With movies you work hard over a short period. In the past I had commitment issues [with the time required to do series TV]. Then I realized I had been working three years steadily, really enjoying it, and never flaked out! In the beginning I was so scared.\n\nHow did you get over your fear?\n\nThe actual practicality of doing it day after day takes over. \n\nSpeaking of being scared, what about the car thing?\n\n[During the taping of an assasination attempt on \"The West Wing\"] I was run over by a limo, and I walked away from it. It was moving really slow, three or four miles an hour. I never saw it coming; I never had a chance to tense up. It was a two-ton limo, it wasn't even a standard limo. It was a huge master [scene], and we were laughing because we were face down on the pavement. I saw the wheel just coming off my leg. They yelled, \"Cut!\" There were four guys who picked me up; it happened at about 9 pm. It was our last night of the season. [After the medical exam and no broken bones were found] They said, \"Go home.\" But I felt if I went home, I would have freaked out a lot more. After that, I was a little paranoid about accidents.\n\nHow did you get over it?\n\nOn \"CSI\" I went up in a helicopter. I was kind of terrified, but I decided I could do it. It was better than therapy!\n\nDid Aaron Sorkin write you out of \"The West Wing?\"\n\nNo. He didn't write me out. They left me alive. It was kind of great for me that they let me walk away without a scratch. Aaron is one of the greatest geniuses I have ever had the pleasure of talking to and working with.\n\n\"CSI\" seems to be such a hit you may not be able to go back to \"West Wing,\" even if the door is open.\n\nIt's the new level of shock, how well \"CSI\" is doing. We're all obviously very surprised. I think people like the mystery and the puzzles. I think that people like feeling like they are solving the puzzle with the story. You can watch it, and there are thrills. You are actively able to see what happened .\n\n*You mean people feel relieved that there's going to be a resolve? *\n\nSomebody either did it or they didn't do it. But it's really not a judgment. It is what's real-not \"I'm a cop I'm on the right side of the law.\" I think [the characters ] are human, flawed. \n\nAnd it's not &#8216;sci-fi-ed' out.\n\nThe world in general right now is sort of undefinable-not like when it was the 50's. Not everything is so cut and dried. In the 2000's, there are so many things [to consider]-the environment, all the people who make a living off the environment. We're sort of in this gray area between resources that need protecting and people that need to make their living.\n\n*I know you're a vegetarian; are you vegan? *\n\nI aspire to vegan! On \"CSI,\" [my character] was eating fish in a scene. I don't normally eat fish, but she does. I was eating Chilean seabass-and [someone pointed out] that it is in danger of extinction. They said, \"You might want to know your character is eating an animal that's on the extinct list.\" But I didn't know until we shot it.\n\nIt seems like you are finding a way to make everything work together-your principles and your craft.\n\nIt has been luck, really. If [a project] says something close to my heart, if it makes a statement, that's great. It's all been sort of luck. With \"The West Wing,\" it was an amazing working relationship for me. You rarely get to say that much about the world at large. I felt like a tiny link to some kind of truth.\n\nHow did *Memento* come about?\n\nThat's been really cool, too. We shot that a year and a half ago. I had heard really great things about the script. I was contacted really close to the shoot date. I loved working with Guy Pearce. He is one of my favorite husbands. I've only had a couple. I've been really lucky in the husband category!\n\nYour character is Guy's obsession. Have you seen the completed film?\n\nAt the premiere, I hadn't seen it yet. The hard part was that people kept asking me about it before I was going in. They had really specific questions, like, \"That scene with the prostitute in the bathroom, what did it mean?\" At first I tried to answer the questions, then I started lying! I was really paranoid because of it.\n\n\"CSI\" is going to change things. Are you getting recognized by people yet?\n\nI live in the same neighborhood-go to the same places. I haven't really gone outside the realm. When we break, start traveling, and leave L.A., it will be interesting to see what happens. People are so cool in this town anyway. People who have taken the time [to acknowledge me on the street] have been really great, nice, and supportive. It's good feedback.\n\nYour character doesn't have much of a personal life. Will this change as the show progresses?\n\nIt's a hard decision. We developed a show about the stories and not about the people. People have really liked that going into year two. There was sort of a decision that if you found out things about [the characters] it would be through their jobs. You get to know people first, before you get to know their intimate details. \n\nWhat are your intimate details?\n\nYou mean me, or my character?\n\nBoth. Come on, think of something!\n\nI'll start with Sara first. An intimate detail about Sara is that there is something dark in her past that involves her in the work that she is doing. Not something that happened to her personally, but someone close to her. We're still forming that; she might be one of the characters who has a reference point. I love that she's not a cop, that there are gray areas, not representing moral authority. She just has the skills. You can never afford closure, give certainty to people. [In \"CSI\"] they can't go back and fix what happened to people, they can just come in after the worst day of [the survivors'] lives and see what they can do to help. I think that's what the show is about.\n\nIt does focus on recovering and healing.\n\nIn Western society in general, the \"d\" word is never used. Everyone at some point is going to have to deal with death on a personal level. It's a vague, conceptual thing for a lot of people in America. This show takes a very good look at that, and that's why it is so popular-people are watching.\n\nOkay. Now your intimate detail. You thought I forgot, right?\n\nNo, I didn't. What do you mean by an intimate detail?\n\nSomething in your life that is a reference point. I know you had a friend whose mom died a violent death.\n\nYeah. That, and my mom passed four years ago. My friend's mom was murdered. It was violent and aggressive, horrible. My mom died of an illness (ovarian cancer), and her death was very fast for an illness. Very fast and very slow-a couple of years separated my friend and me, her mother and my mother. Those two really stand out for me. \n\nDid you incorporate her illness into your own work as an actor? \n\nWhen I got the job on \"ER\" my mom had been sick, and the first day I started [shooting] I got the call that things were a lot more grave than I thought. It stayed with me for the length of the show. The first two seasons were a balancing act: a great job and a horrific thing going on personally. My mom made me promise that I wouldn't [go home]. That's my reference for \"CSI,\" because we're dealing with loss and death. \n\nYou do as much with silences as you do with dialogue. Are you aware that you are doing this?\n\nI think that's the whole idea of listening. I've seen that with other actors-the moment where it could be an actor's most brilliant moment, where the actor says nothing. There are also times when it's great to have this five-page dialogue, like Mamet. Our shows are great because most of the time we're talking about the science.\n\nIs your name your mom's creation?\n\nYes. She was French Canadian. The idea of the \"J\" was a novel idea. My dad was of Irish descent-but it was weird at that time [in Canada]. It was like being black or Mexican, and white. There was a lot of animosity around everybody mixing. There's still some flavor of that in Montreal. They left it all behind. I'm named after four relatives!\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI don't know. I won't be able to work [during the strike]; maybe it's better to travel, just to recharge and bring stuff back to my work. We're pretending that we're having a life when we act, but it's cool to have one to use as a reference.\n\nSo you'll strike if that happens?\n\nI definitely support the union. I don't want to strike, but it's a hard year with the contracts. We are like athletes, the career span is shorter. We'll see.\n\n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox has appeared in a number of prominent television shows, including E.R., C.S.I. and West Wing. In Memento, she shows up as the victimized wife of Leonard Shelby - only seen in flashback sequences. For her, the experience of filming the film was almost like a dream because she only had to be on-set for a few days. \"I filmed, I think, three days out of 29. So I had a very short, easy time,\" she said.\n\nAt the premiere's after-party, she told Zap2it that she was thoroughly impressed by what she had seen. It had been the first time she had seen the film all the way through. While some audience members may have left confused, though, Fox had the benefit of knowing how the story ended before ever sitting down. \"I thought it was great,\" she said. \"I want to see it again already - knowing the ending is very helpful for seeing it from the beginning.\"\n\nGetting cast for the part, Fox knew very little about the story when she accepted the role. Of course she had read the script, but there were many nuances that she wasn't quite clear about. She ended up seeking out some help to understand what was going on. \"I really did read the script several times,\" she said. \"And I cornered Guy (Pearce), because he's in every scene, so I'm like &#8216;You must know what's going on. Come on, help me out.' And then I cornered Chris (the director) about it, but he's extremely ambiguous - which he seems committed to, which is very cool. And tonight I feel like at least I think I understand the stuff. I'm not sure if I got it right, but I left there with an understanding of what I thought was happening.\n\n\"I realized very quickly that I had lucked out in a huge way that I was getting to do something really cool,\" she said. \"You always hope that you get to do something interesting or different or smart - makes a statement. You always hope for that kind of stuff.\"\n",

        "content": "\nAre you surprised at the popularity of the show and the amount of young people who are going to college now to learn more about forensics?\n\n  \nJORJA FOX: I'm enormously surprised at the success of ?C.S.I.? I think that even in all of our wildest dreams that we could have imagined as great a run as we are having and I'm just thrilled about it. I feel blessed every day. I'm also surprised that, yes, there seems to be an increase in kids wanting to study forensics.  \n  \nI know that the big joke right now is with law enforcement, when they talk to people, everybody thinks that they can have their crime solved in 40 minutes or at least less than two days. Unfortunately, that's the key to our show. We're hearing about that right now and it'll be interesting to see if the kids stick to it or if it's something that looks more glossy than it is perhaps on a day-to-day basis./p \n\nHow has the reaction been within the law enforcement community? Do you hear mostly positive responses?\n\n  \nJORJA FOX: Yes, for the most part everybody is very, very supportive. It's really a great thing. We try very hard to make the show as real as we can. Time is the only place where we really take big cheats. We thought about opening a case in September and we'll solve it in December - like real-life - but we thought we might lose some of our audience then.\n\nWhat's it like joining a show that's so successful?  \n  \nARCHIE KAYO: It's so exciting.\n\nIs it a little bit intimidating joining one of the highest rated shows on television?\n\n  \nARCHIE KAYO: Yes, there's no question. I think it's certainly a genuine privilege. Besides the show being so well done, everyone on the show is a class act. Everyone is realizing that it is kind of an extraordinary ride and they are all aware.  \n  \nJORJA FOX: Basically we are all loony and down-to-earth.\n\nIs it really crazy behind-the-scenes? It's such a serious drama.  \n  \nJORJA FOX: Yeah, we cut loose.  \n  \nARCHIE KAYO: You couldn't imagine.\n\nWho is the practical joker?  \n  \nJORJA FOX: I think probably George Eads is the biggest practical joker. But everybody is fair game and everybody has jokes that they like to play on each other.\n\nThis movie tonight - \"The Emperor's Club\" - is basically about teachers and the impact they have on their students. Did you have a teacher who made an impact on you?\n\n  \nJORJA FOX: Yes, several. I am specifically thinking right now about a high school English teacher, Mrs. Williamson, and a high school Humanities teacher, Mrs. Asher.\n\nWas it what they taught you or how they taught you?  \n  \nJORJA FOX: Both, I think. They were really accessible to all the kids in the school, for the most part. It didn't matter if you were doing well in the class or if you were doing poorly in the class, they kept an eye on everybody in addition to just inspiring kids. For me, I never loved Shakespeare or traditional English studies; I like modern stuff. For a teacher to get me really excited about Shakespeare to a point where you are passionate about it - you can't wait to read the next chapter - that shows dedication.  \n  \nARCHIE KAYO: I had an English Composition teacher in college who I think I really, really looked up to. I thought so much of him as a professor, he was so inspirational, that I actually wanted to be him when I graduated. So I went to talk to him and I said, ?I want to teach.? He said, ?Archie, I really admire that, I think it's noble, but I think you should go live your life and then come back and you'll have more to teach.? At first I was offended, but now I realize how right he really was.\n\nHave you called him since you started acting to let him know he was right?  \n  \nARCHIE KAYO: (Laughing) I can't find him. I've been looking for him but I don't know where he's gone.\n\n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox appears to have the golden touch, having starred in three of the biggest US TV hits of the last decade! She played Dr Maggie Doyle in ER, guest-starred as Special Agent Maggie Toscano in The West Wing, and now plays ambitious forensic investigator Sara Sidle in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which begins its second series on 5 this week. Jorja's taste in film roles is just as inspired, having played Guy Pearce's wife in critically acclaimed psychological thriller Memento. She also runs her own production company. Somehow, she found time to speak to 5 about her seemingly charmed career.\n\nThough Jorja is currently busy filming an episode of CSI (?I'll be spending the night walking around a sewer!?), she's happy to talk to 5: ?I love Channel 5 and I have a real affection for Brits.? She's equally enthusiastic about her role in the hugely successful forensic science drama: ?When I started with &#8216;ER' and &#8216;The West Wing', they were already these huge runaway hits, but CSI's really special in the sense that it was a roll of the dice. Who knew? They could have cancelled it after three shows. It was magnetic ? it just drew me to it...?\n\nDetermined\n\nJorja grew up in Melbourne Beach, a small town on the Florida coast, and was &#8216;spotted' in a model search at a local mall: ?It was great ? I got to travel. I was in Europe when I was 17, and I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. I was fearless then!? But she was always determined to go into acting, a decision that soon paid dividends with some sensational roles: as well the aforementioned parts in The West Wing, ER and CSI, Jorja has starred in the groundbreaking &#8216;coming out' episode of Ellen. Cult film Memento is also a career highlight. The movie's baffling chronology leaves audiences uncertain as to what has actually happened ? so was Jorja let in on the secret, or did she construct her own theory? ?Not at all. If Chris Nolan [Memento's director] knew, he wasn't telling. When I went in on my first day, he could barely explain it himself! But, luckily for me, I didn't really have to understand it. I heard that Chris had various different edited versions ? I love that movie for that reason. It was the same with &#8216;The Others' when I saw that recently. I sort of like to go along for the ride, so I'm not really looking for clues, or trying to figure out the plot twists.?\n\nSurprising\n\nWhen she accepted the role in CSI, the show's massive success (it recently reached number one in the Nielsen Ratings) was by no means a foregone conclusion, as Jorja explains: ?We hoped that it would do well, but the bottom line was, it's partly about death, which is not necessarily incredibly commercial. It's also about these experiments, and it's been a little surprising that so many viewers are prepared to &#8216;travel' with us on subjects like, say, shoelaces!? This focus on the characters' work, as opposed to their personal lives, appeals to Jorja, especially in contrast with shows that run out of dramatic steam very quickly: ?I think there is a tendency for people to think that you've got to make very high drama, but on CSI, we hope that people will always want to know more about the characters than they already do ? that's sort of the goal. It's almost like snapshots, which is fun because it helps us as actors to be mysterious for longer!? There are exceptions, says Jorja, but generally, ?The scriptwriters try and tie any personal stuff to a particular case.?\n\nDepth\n\nThe actress acknowledges the team effort that goes into producing CSI, and reserves special admiration for Elizabeth Devine, a hugely experienced former crime scene investigator who is now a technical consultant and story editor on the show. ?I really admire what Liz did for a living ? there's a very high burn-out rate. She's very influential on CSI.? It is understood that Elizabeth bases the plotlines featuring Jorja's character (Sara Sidle) on experiences from her own early career, while Catherine Willows, the character played by Marg Helgenberger, is involved in stories based on her later cases. Can Jorja confirm or refute this? She says: ?That's so interesting. Certainly, I do often get to tell the stories that were Liz's when she was around my age, and I wouldn't be surprised if that were also true for Marg's character. That gives it a whole new appreciation and depth.?  \n",

Eric says that when filming wraps for the summer he plans on \"travelling to Europe and hitting the film festivals\". May we suggest a less violent approach, say a handshake, when arriving in Berlin?\n\nJorja Fox, actor interviewed by Eric Szmanda\n\nEric Szmanda: Has working on CSI changed your outlook on life? \n\nJorja Fox: Well, last night when I cooked dinner for myself in my toaster-oven, I sat down and watched NOVA. [laughter] I sat right down and picked that station. They were having this great show on black holes and stars in the galaxy, and I don't know why, of all the channels, I thought maybe I'll watch NOVA tonight. \n\nES: You feel this obligation to study up. \n\nJF: I was always into true crime. It was always about the psychological aspects, the thin line that people walk, you know. What makes somebody go one way and somebody go another? And how two people can have the same sort of family situation and one becomes a violent mind and the other becomes a great writer. Forensic psychology is an area of the show that I wish we had more of because it fascinates me so much. I miss it and we started to do it for a minute and they pulled back on it and decided it was another show. I'm also interested in the Sci-Fi and horror genres. So it translated really well. \n\nES: Nice combination. \n\nJF: I know, even though I had sort of pulled back. I was scared of everything because I was always engulfing myself in scary things. So I needed to cut myself off a little bit and now it's good balances it out a bit better. \n\nES: How was it working on MEMENTO with Guy Pearce? \n\nJF: Working on MEMENTO was a dream literally. I had no idea what was going on and was too embarrassed to say anything. I found out later nobody knew what was going on. Chris Nolan had three separate story ideas going on in the editing process. It was really fun and a complete surprise from shooting it to even right now. And Guy Pearce was one of my favorite movie husbands. He's totally grounded and sweet. Very wise. \n\nES: What was that thing in your life that steered you in this direction? \n\nJF: Steered me in the acting direction? \n\nES: Yeah. \n\nJF: I always wanted to be an actress. Maybe because I grew up in an immigrant family - I have a 99-year-old grandmother - and this idea if the old world and the storytelling. I loved for my mom and my grandmother to sit down at night and tell these stories and they were really good at it. So from a really young age I just loved the idea of storytelling. I had a little TV problem, too. From age 5 to 15. \n\nES: What were your favorite shows? \n\nJF: Well, there several over the ages. CHARLIE'S ANGEL was a big one. LOST IN SPACE I loved, and THE BIONIC WOMAN. \n\nES: All those are just a little bit before my time. Those were all in syndication by the time I was- \n\nJF: Well, yeah, LOST IN SPACE is old. They were in syndication when I watched them too. MASH, was one of my favorite shows ever. I think I've seen every MASH ever made. \n\nES: It's the MASH anniversary right now. \n\nJF: Is it really? \n\nES: Yeah, I saw Hot Lips on THE TODAY SHOW this morning. \n\nJF: Nice. The show was going on during the Vietnam War, but they called it Korea because they couldn't be that controversial. \n\nES: If you weren't doing this what would it be? \n\nJF: Music, which no one ever paid me a cent to do. \n\nES: Singing? \n\nJF: Guitar probably. Or maybe I'd go into politics. Yeah, I have a romance about it. Which is probably all because I've never done anything in politics. It seems so romantic and cool to me. Everyday doing things that you think you believe in, but I'm sure it's better in thought. What do you think you'd be doing? \n\nES: I'd probably still be working in the music business. It's the only other thing I can see myself doing. I think it would have to be some kind of promotion or entertainment of some kind. \n\nJF: It seems to me, I don't know much about the music industry, but it seems that it's always at the insanity level, except for maybe the Motown years. Everything got made right for awhile but it seems like the pendulum has gone to the other side again. A band can have number one singles and still not have any money at all.\n\nES: The average member in a rock band makes about the same salary as a 7-11 employee. \n\nJF: Whoa! \n\nES: Until your album starts selling millions you don't seeing anything in terms of residuals. So a lot of them just blow their wad way too early and then they are left with nothing, which I have seen happen to a lot of my friends. \n\nJF: You imagine it's the beginning of your new life, you know. You get this great deal and the money comes in. You get better equipment and a nice van, and all that kind of stuff. \n\nES: It still comes out of your budget, which a lot of bands don't realize either. Dirty business, I don't know why we're involved in such a dirty business. [laughter] \n\nJF: Is there a business that's not dirty though? \n\nES: I doubt it. I've realized that it's all pretty relative. My dad sells medical supplies and there's really no difference in the everyday interaction with clients versus what I was doing when I was trying to sell records. It's all the same, it's just products. Even what we're doing, we are just selling a product. \n\nJF: Absolutely, a very popular product. A product that a lot of people are interested in and they'll spend money on. It's going to be real interesting to see Time/Warner this year with the new CEO. If I ever had a company, I would try to keep as much integrity as I possibly could, and I think they've done that with so much genius. Or at least compared to a lot of other companies out there. They've done some pioneering, beautiful things. \n\nES: When you got into this acting thing, did you ever think some day you'd be seen as a product? \n\nJF: Yeah, I think what's so funny about it is that you're lucky if you're seen as a product. That's a lucky thing. Probably from the time I was 16 there started to be an awareness of that, but this really is a business. There is art and there's business and sometimes they get together. Art needs business and business definitely needs art. \n\nES: How do you deal with it? \n\nJF: I haven't been called on to be a product really. I think I've been really lucky, It's weird because I was coming from New York City and I had some ideas about LA that weren't very nice. I thought it was a place people came to sell out. That greed is at the base of everything that happens in LA. It was naive of me. Im glad I've stayed and stuck it out for a while because in LA I've met more people with more heart and soul than maybe I ever got to meet in New York. How long have you lived here? \n\nES: Seven years. \n\nJF: Longer than me even. \n\nES: Yes, I spent a year of that in Chicago and six months in Vancouver. \n\nJF: What year were you in Chicago? \n\nES: '96-'97 \n\nJF: I think I was already in LA. I spent a year in Chicago in 1995. \n\nES: Doing what? \n\nJF: I did a TV series in Chicago. \n\nES: What was it? \n\nJF: It was called MISSING PERSONS. We looked for missing people. [laughter] Which is sometimes what we do here on CSI. We didn't have the gadgets at all. Mostly we just talked to people, we did interviews and things like that. We did look for clues sometimes, but it wasn't really the kind of clues we look for now. \n\nES: How did you like Chicago? \n\nJF: I love Chicago in the summertime, but it was really hard for me to work there in the winter. You are in high heels and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and it's negative 60 degrees. That kind of grueling cold. The camera was frozen and they'd have to thaw out the camera. I think it's an amazing city. \n\nES: Do you think you'll stay here in LA. \n\nJF: I don't know if I'll ever stay anywhere forever. If I want to keep acting there's only really one place that I would want to go. I wasn't ready to quit acting so I came here. And it's been really good to me. It's been really good to you too. \n\nES: I'd say. No reason to complain. [laughter]\n\n",

She has made some discoveries among the living, too.\n\n\"I was a jaded New Yorker with this idea that everyone in L.A. sells their soul,\" says Fox, thirty-three. \"And I don't think I've met people with more soul than the ones I've worked with out here.\"\n\nIt helps that Fox has worked on some of the best shows on television, first as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER for two-and-a-half season, then as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing.\n\n\"It was huge for me,\" says Fox of her gig as Toscano. \"Here I am, this liberal Democrat, enthusiastically political person, and I had a chance to be on a show that tells that story ebery week.\"\n\nOffered a more sizable role on CSI in the fall of 2000, she reluctantly traded in her earpiece and pistol for a scalpel and latex gloves. The unheralded show turned out to be a surprise critical and ratingshit, and Fox's charmed Hollywood life continued.\n\nThe daughter of an Irish-Canadian father and a Belgian-Canadia mother who immigrated to the U.S. from Montreal prior to her birth, Fox had the nomadic childhood common to many actors. \"My mom had to move every two or three years, even if it was just a block away to a new house,\" says Fox.\n\nToday, Fox is tall (five-foot-nine) and rail-thin, but growing up in small Melbourne Beach, Florida, she was overweight. \"My mom was a child of the Depression and World War II,\" she says, \"so the best thing that she could do for me and my older brother was to feed us regularly. I was eating five meals a day. Suddenly I realized that, wow, I could eat three meals instead.\"\n\nNewly thin, fifteen-year-old Fox entered a modeling contest at a local mall on a whim &#8212; and won. \"I was the palest, whitest kid with dark brown hair in Florida, where the ideal was to be blonde and tan,\" says the onetime tomboy. \"The whole town was just aghast.\"\n\nFox subsequently moved to New York and launched a lucrative career as a teen model. \"It was one of the greatest things I've ever done, she says. \"Not only to move to New York, but then to go to Europe for six months and meet people from all over the world.\"\n\nWhile many teens would sell their souls to model professionally, Fox retired from the runway at eighteen to pursue her true love: acting. Studying at HB Studios while supporting herself as a coat-check girl and bartender, she found only sporadic work in indie films such as The Kill-Off (1989) and Happy Hell Night (1992) until 1993, when she was cast in the ABC serious Missing Persons. It lasted less than one season, but the experiance persuaded her to move to Hollywood.\n\nFox now has a burgeoning film career (Memento) and Honeypot, an L.A. theater company she co-founded with a group of fellow New York transplants; but she's happy to dedicate the bulk of her time to CSI.\n\n\"It's been such an amazing place to come to work,\" says Fox. \"And if it's your job and it happens to be amazing, then that's the best thing you can ever have.\"\n\n",

As criminalist Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox, thirty-three, a bohemian type whose backstory includes recurring roles on ER and West Wing, would be the neoPeggy Lipton. Gary Dourdan, thirty-five, a Meisner-trained Philly native who got his start on A Different World, landed the part of sly Warrick Brown; in Pleather jackets, \"War\" looks as groovy as Linc. And Savannah's George Eads, also thirty-five and a former public relations major from Texas who could pass for a navy S.E.A.L. (or a crew-cut Michael Cole), completed the triangle as hot-shot Nick Stokes.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd in a show where everyone seems to get along. \"I've never felt closer to a group of people,\" says Fox  a good thing, since the group is usually exiled to quiet Santa Clarita, a residential town one hour north of L.A that pinch-hits for the Vegas suburbs. \"It's a long haul,\" Helgenberger says. \"There are lots of graveyard shifts and night exteriors. Everyone gets fried.\"\n\n[...]\n\nFox, a Florida beach girl, is the \"cool-but-sweet chick\" who surfs and downs veggie burgers. And \"I'm the mother hen, for sure,\" says Helgenberger. She's even been known to bring in pies for the cast and crew. \"I'm not exactly Betty Crocker, so I don't actually make them,\" she laughs. \"I just try to make sure everyone's doing okay, keep the spirits up.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

Our storyline is going to deal with a murder in the little people community.\" \n\n\"It's very cool,\" GEORGE EADS (Nick) adds, \"because &#8216;Under the Rainbow' is the last time I saw a group of little people together on film.\" \n\nWhen Lawrence Ames (MICHAEL GILDEN) is found hanging on the stage where the convention will take place, Grissom (WILLIAM PETERSEN), Sara (Fox) and Nick (Eads) are called to the scene. At first it appears to be a suicide, but Grissom disputes that, and the team sets to work to track down the killer. \n\n\"We've done a couple of shows in the past that have dealt with situations that hadn't gotten much television coverage,\" Petersen explains. \"We always find it interesting to get into a milieu that is unfamiliar to regular network viewers. The value of television is to take you places you don't normally get to be. These little people conventions are not something where &#8216;average' people go.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Catherine is attacked by an unknown assailant at a crime scene where she is collecting evidence. \n\nFor a sneak peek at the \"A Little Murder\" episode of \"CSI,\" watch tonight's ET.

        "content": "\nJorja Fox appears to have the golden touch, having starred in three of the biggest US TV hits of the last decade!\n\nShe played Dr Maggie Doyle in ER, guest-starred as Special Agent Maggie Toscana in The West Wing, and now plays ambitious forensic investigator Sara Sidle in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which begins its second series on 5 tonighy.\n\nJorja's taste in film roles is just as inspired, having played Guy Pearce's wife in critically acclaimed psychological thriller Memento. She also runs her own production company.\n\nBut it is CSI, which has become a cult hit here in the UK, which is currently making her name.\n\nDespite spending most of her time on the set in Las Vegas, Jorja is more than aware of the ripples that CSI is causing across the Atlantic.\n\nShe says: \"When I started on ER and The West Wing they were already huge runaway hits, but CSI's really special in the sense that it was a roll of the dice. Who knew? They could have cancled it after three shows. It was magnetic &#8212; it just drew me to it ...\"\n\nJorja grew up in Melbourne Beach, a small town on the Florida coast, and was \"spotted\" in a model search at a local shopping mall.\n\n\"It was great &#8212; I got to travel. I was in Europe when I was 17, and I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. I was fearless then,\" she says.\n\nBut she was as determined to act, a decision that soon paid dividends with some sensational roles: as well as the aforementioned parts, Jorja has starred in the groundbreaking \"coming out\" episode of Ellen.\n\nCult film Memento is also a career highlight. The movie's baffling chronology leaves audiences uncertain as to what has actually happened ? so was Jorja let in on the secret, or did she construct her own theory?\n\n\"Not at all. If Chris Nolan [Memento's director] knew, he wasn't telling.\n\n\"When I went in on my first day, he could barely explain it himself! But, luckily for me, I didn't really have to understand it,\" she laughs.\n\n\"I heard that Chris had various different edited versions ? I love that movie for that reason. It was the same with &#8216;The Others' when I saw that recently.\n\n\"I sort of like to go along for the ride, so I'm not really looking for clues, or trying to figure out the plot twists.?\n\nCSI is now the top rated drama in the US.\n\nJorja explains: \"We hoped that it would do well, but the bottom line was, it's partly about death, which is not necessarily incredibly commercial.\n\n\"It's also about these experiments, and it's been a little surprising that so many viewers are prepared to &#8216;travel' with us on subjects like, say, shoelaces!?\n\nThis focus on the characters' work, as opposed to their personal lives, appeals to Jorja, especially in contrast with shows that run out of dramatic steam very quickly.\n\nShe says: \"I think there is a tendency for people to think that you've got to make very high drama, but on CSI, we hope that people will always want to know more about the characters than they already do ? that's sort of the goal.\n\n\"It's almost like snapshots, which is fun because it helps us as actors to be mysterious for longer!?\n\nThere are exceptions, says Jorja, but generally, \"The scriptwriters try and tie any personal stuff to a particular case.?\n\nThe actress acknowledges the team effort that goes into producing CSI, and reserves special admiration for Elizabeth Devine, a hugely experienced former crime scene investigator who is now a technical consultant and story editor on the show.\n\n\"I really admire what Liz did for a living ? there's a very high burn-out rate. She's very influential on CSI.?\n\nIt is understood that Elizabeth bases the plotlines featuring Jorja's character (Sara Sidle) on experiences from her own early career, while Catherine Willows, the character played by Marg Helgenberger, is involved in stories based on her later cases.\n\nBut even the actresses don't know if it is true.\n\nJorja says: \"That's so interesting. Certainly, I do often get to tell the stories that were Liz's when she was around my age, and I wouldn't be surprised if that were also true for Marg's character.\n\n\"That gives it a whole new appreciation and depth.\"\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation, tonight, Channel 5, 9pm\n\n",

        "content": "She's a dressed-down, seriously smart cookie in &#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Invesigation', but off-screen, Jorja Fox loves to get glammed-up for big nights out in Hollywood.\n\nBrains and beauty can mix. That's if vivacious American actress Jorja Fox, 34, is anything to go by. The ex-model plays Sara Sidle, a bookishly sexy forensic scientist in Channel 5's number-one show, CSI: Crime Scene Invesigation, which also has the second biggest TV ratings in the US. But life on screen is more grit than glamour, with Sidle spending most of her time at Las Vegas murder scenes. \"I'm more into make-up than Sara would be; she's practical, although she certainly flirts with the guys,\" Fox laughs.\n\nIn *CSI*, your character has very straight hair, yet yours is naturally curly. How come?\n\nI associate her with action-figure qualities: sleekness and stelth and, for me, straight hair reflects that. I use Phillip B Straight Baume [&pound;16 ; from Space NK, 0870 169 9999], and straightening irons every day.\n\nWhat do you do with your hair off duty?\n\nMostly, I wear my hair curly, partly to give it a rest because I straighten it every day at work. So I'll let it do it's own thing.\n\nYour character is quite no-nonsense, but is she feminine? Does she like make-up?\n\nThe characters are almost always on the job, so you see her in work clothes. Sometimes she has to go to dark, creepy places - sewers, deserted roads, and under people's houses - so she wears lots of jeans, boots and long coats. Crime scenes are dangerous places. Often criminals return to the crime scene, so she needs clothes she can run in! Make-up wise, she likes low-key lips and smoky, mysterious eyes to reflect the intense, brooding vibe of her character.\n\nNow that *CSI* is so successful, you must have to go to awards ceremonies and dress up.\n\nYes, we have been invited to awards ceremonies, which is nice and it's exciting to achieve the recognition. Getting ready to go is really fun and I enjoy havign my hair and make-up done. I always wear a classing gown and the full hair and make-up works.\n\nAre you a beauty junkie?\n\nYes, I love the natural beauty of women and I think make-up is fantastic when it's work for fun, to feel different or to create characters. But if people feel they need to wear it before they can present themselves to the world, then I feel sad for them. All shapes and colours and sizes are beautiful.\n\nWhat's your favourite make-up look?\n\nI love the dewy, healthy look. For me, it's all about looking alive and fresh but, for going out in the evening, I love the old-school glamour look with vampy eye make-up.\n\nSo, what have you got in your make-up bag?\n\nChristian Dio Teint Diorlift Concealer [&pound;15 ; available nationwide], I normally don't leave the house without putting some on, a MAC brown eyeliner [&pound;9 ; 020 77534 9222] and brow pencil, although I wear black eyeliner if I'm going clubbing. On a night out I'll also wear mascara and lipgloss. I love Stila Lip Glazes [&pound;18 ; from Space NK], and Paula Dorf Lipsicle lipglosses [&pound;13 ; from Dickins & Jones; 020 7734 707]. I keep it simple on skin as I wear power and foundation all day and I like to give my skin a break.\n\nHow do you cope with the punishing schedule on *CSI*?\n\nNormally it's 12 to 15 hours a day, but we do get days off and three-day weekends occasionally. If I am especially tired, they'll right me a lighter episode.\n\nHow do you keep up your energy?\n\nCoffee, coffee and more coffee. Also, I try to get at least eight to 10 hours sleep. My social life has gone out the window. But I try to keep my energy up by eating well- lots of fruit, vegetables and protein. I eat a lot of those protien bars, too. I'm a vegetarian, not so much for health reasons but becuase I live in the big city, where there's plenty of food, I don't see the need to kill animals to eat.\n\nWhat do you do to disguise tiredness?\n\nWe have genius make-up artists who put us back together, but I drink tons of water to prevent dehydration and puffy eyes.\n\nDo you have any beauty rituals?\n\nOh yes, I love the bath. I'll put essential oils in the bath and play a little music.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nWe get time to relax on set, so I go to my trailer and play guitar. The Winnebegos go everywhere with us and I take all my tapestries and games and cars, and I have a dog, so I take him with me. LA is very much an outdoor culture, so I go to the beach and to the mountains with my dog.\n\n",

        "content": "\nAs crime-solving wizards on TV's top-rated drama, the stars of CSI steep themselves in blood, bullet holes and (very) gross anatomy. \n\nThis past summer the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation did what you'd expect anyone from a major hit series to do. They kicked back and forgot about the inanimate parade of bruised, gouged, mutilated and (on one memorable occasion) liquefied corpses that form the dramatic center of the CBS show's high-tech forensic sleuthing. Costars Jorja Fox, Eric Szmanda and Gary Dourdan all vacationed together in Paris. Evanston, Ill., native William Petersen took in a Chicago Cubs baseball game with six CSI grips from L.A. \n\nMeanwhile Marg Helgenberger, 43, went on a busman's holiday from hell: She'd been worried that the show's phenomenal popularity &#8212; signaled by its own new spinoff, CSI: Miami, teaming NYPD Blue alumni David Caruso and Kim Delaney &#8212; might be taking the edge off her performance as intrepid detective (and ex-stripper) Catherine Willows. So she spent a night with Las Vegas's own crime scene investigators, the inspiration for the series. The unit was called to a casino hotel to check out a corpse, male, in his 30s, dead of drugs and alcohol. \"You get a sense of the fragility of life,\" says Helgenberger, seated near a photo of her son Huey, 12, in her trailer on the set in Valencia, Calif. \"But I also came away with a sense of what heroes these people are. They do a job most people couldn't or wouldn't do, and make a difference solving crimes.\" \n\nAs of July, Helgenberger was back on the set for CSI's third season, which kicked off Sept. 26 with its best ratings ever. An audience of 30 million tuned in for the adventures of this savvy, cast-iron-stomached Vegas forensics unit led by the obsessive Gil Grissom (Petersen, 49), with an assist from a team that also includes Warrick Brown (Dourdan, 35), Nick Stokes (George Eads, 35) and Sara Sidle (Fox, 34). Their cases are peppered with grisly details &#8212; an old lady devoured by her cats, a cheerleader disemboweled on a soccer field &#8212; and discussed with such intimidating jargon as \"phenolphthalein\" (a chemical that detects blood) and \"epithelial\" (skin cells). \"Most of these terms are in Latin,\" says Petersen. \"But we learn as we go along.\" \n\nThey learn fast. The show, which has supplanted ER as TV's top-rated drama, is now famous enough that when Dourdan and Eads last year promoted CSI in Buenos Aires, where the show airs, local police decided to take the stars down a peg. \"They showed us tapes of autopsies to see if we would crack,\" Dourdan says. \"We didn't.\" \n\nFar from being queasy, the cast seems genuinely curious about the show's morbid matters. Petersen &#8212; who is coexecutive producer and costar &#8212; unwinds by plowing through the dense prose of The Future of Life by forensic entomologist Edward O. Wilson. One shelf of Helgenberger's colorfully decorated trailer includes Practical Homicide Investigation. The set's atmosphere is hardly funereal, though. Some days Fox, Dourdan, Eads and Robert David Hall (who plays coroner Albert Robbins) bring out guitars for an off-camera sing-along of folk and blues, and Paul Guilfoyle, 53 (police captain Jim Brass), is considered a reliable cutup. Helgenberger arrives already chilled out. \"I did yoga at 4:45 a.m.,\" she says. \n\nAll around them, however, is the presence of death. There's the lab (stocked, for verisimilitude's sake, with several million dollars' worth of equipment, including a $500,000 ballistics identifier) and Robbins's morgue. \"One of the treats for me,\" says Hall, 55, \"is what our special effects guy will do to the corpses.\" The cadavers are actually actors, made up to look seriously dead and damaged. And all that blood? It's Karo Syrup, \"and it tastes like peppermint,\" says Eads. \n\nEven though the gore is fake, Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda, who plays DNA tech Greg Sanders, could do with a little less of it. They will never again make the mistake of eating pizza before a forensics scene. \"I started feeling nauseous,\" says Fox. \"I don't think I could ever be a CSI.\" \n\n",

Just ask actress Jorja Fox.\n\nWhen Jorja Fox isn't busy playing a forensic scientist on the CBS Drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, she's sleuthing out new ways to stay fit. Her latest fitness foray: adding tennis to her repertoire, which already includes running, boogie boarding and hiking. Fox hadn't played since her teens, so she started by having a coaching session with Sue Whiteside, tennis director at Rancho Valencia in Rancho Santa Fe, California. She recieved not only a skills brushup but also a terrific workout. \"I don't tone my arms as consistently as I do my legs,\" Fox says, so Whiteside suggested practicing serves to build up arm strength and add curves \"And don't shy away from overheads!\" Whiteside says- nailing them strengthens shoulders. To up the cardio factor, get to the ball on one bounce. \"If you work hard, you can burn 500 calories in an hour,\" says Whiteside. Fox has fallen in love with tennis: \"My producers might kill me, but maybe I'll start whacking balls against the side of the soundstage during downtime.\" \n\n",

        "content": "\nIf you've already seen an episode of CSI, perhaps someone pointed out the face of Jorja Fox. Remember in 1996 when Maggie Doyle made her debut in Cook County in ER. It is with this role that she allured the public by accuratly protraying an intern who, after a fashion, tried to make her place among the doctors and befriended Carter (Noah Wyle), before acknowledging her homosexuality. In real life, Jorja is truly passionate, her talents touching everything she does : playing the guitar, singing, writing plays and working with a group with which she co-founded (Honey Pot Productions).\n\nThe least one can say, is that work does not frighten her. She once more showed that lack of fear, this last season, when she debuted on CSI: she was part of the Secret Service, charged to protect the daughter of President Bartlet on The West Wing. Jorja is a big name actress because she rose briskly from small to large productions, where she takes part in a considerable number of independent productions on the large screen. Because her career requires a great deal of investment of her self, she turns to the ocean as a resource. She is connected to the water, because it reminds her of her childhood: she grew up in Melbourne Beach, a small island in Florida. \n\n",

        "content": "We go \"undercover\" with C.S.I's Jorja Fox. By which we mean we dress her in crazy getups and ask her silly questions. It's our m.o.! \n\nSilver Lake, California, 3:19 on a sunny afternoon at the dog park, about a softball pitch away from downtown L.A.: I was scheduled to meet Jorja Fox at 3 P.M. and follow her around with a tape recorder while she walked her dogs. Just when I start to think, This sucks, I see a sprightly, tank-topped, ponytailed woman come bounding through the gates. It's her Jorja Fox! And I was just beginning to feel like a creep sitting in this place without a dog. \"I'm so sorry I'm late! You must have felt like a creep sitting in this place alone without a dog\", she says. \"No problem\", I say. After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja Fox is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. And with a role in last year's indie-film sensation Memento, the lovely Ms. Fox is proving that she's a lucky charm of sorts - or at least something I'd like to have draped around my neck. On CSI she plays a scientist who must find the answers to many bizarre and often sordid questions. I decided to turn the tables on her. It's funny seeing her there - you know, under the table. \n\nSTUFF: Your character on CSI knows a thing or two about crime scenes. What sort of things should we watch out for if we murdered someone and didn't want to be linked to the crime? Theoretically, of course.  \n  \nJORJA: Well, I definitely think you should not murder anyone, under any circumstances - ever! \n\nSTUFF: It's a little late for that right now.  \n  \nJORJA: I would say call the paramedics first then call the cops. If you can't do that, then just cover your entire body in latex and get rid of the corpse and you'll probably get away with it. \n\nSTUFF: How should I get rid of the body?  \n  \nJORJA: A piranha fish tank is my personal pick. \n\nSTUFF: When a director asks you to be angry, do you think of the time the neighborhood bully threw your pet turtle down a well.  \n  \nJORJA: Anger is very easy for me. The hardest thing a director could ever ask me to do is cry. That's when I become super-actory. I have to go in a corner and psyche myself up for it. I think I'm kind of an angry person. Anger is something I identify with. For better or worse. \n\nSTUFF: What's the strangest outfit you like to put on when nobody else is home?  \n  \nJORJA: Well, my friend who works for the city left his uniform at my house one night and didn't come back, so I tried on this whole weird sort of construction thing with a tool belt. That's pretty kinky. \n\nSTUFF: Let's say I showed up at your house on a typical Sunday morning, flashed my badge and dusted the headboard of your bed for fingerprints. How many different sets would I find?  \n  \nJORJA: Fingers and toes?. Probably only five or six right now. \n\nSTUFF: That's a big headboard.  \n  \nJORJA: I sleep on the floor, by the way. \n\nSTUFF: In preparation for the weekend, have you ever stolen a set of handcuffs or rubber gloves from the set?  \n  \nJORJA: Rubber gloves always comes in handy. I don't use handcuffs on the show, but there's probably a set in my house.\n\nSTUFF: When someone creepy sidles up to you at a bar, how do you get rid of him?  \n  \nJORJA: It doesn't really happen to me. I might have that weird-radar, because people who talk to me are almost never creepy. I'm really lucky that way. You've gotta wonder what kind of vibe you're putting out there if you're having really creepy people come talk to you. \n\nSTUFF: What's the worst pickup line you've ever heard that used your last name?  \n  \nJORJA: Maybe, \"I'm feeling very sly, and I know 'cause you're a Fox that you'd want to make it with me\". \n\nSTUFF: I don't even get it. How do you respond to something like that?  \n  \nJORJA: If I have a drink in my hand, sometimes it accidentally falls in the direction of the person. If somebody's nice enough to come up to me and be interested in me, it's almost always a really cool thing. Unless they're really gross about it. I haven't gone home with anybody who tried to pick me up in a long time. \n\nSTUFF: Would you say you're crazy like a fox, or is your last name nothing but a lie?  \n  \nJORJA: Until I was 14 years old, I was really fat - I was obese. And I have this gap between my teeth. At that time, it was twice the size - you could put a quarter through it - and I had freckles. My mom bought FOXY GIRL T-shirts - which were big, sort of, in the 70's - for every day of the week, and I had to wear one every day. It was kind of brutal. It was very difficult to live up to that. The whole \"foxy\" thing is funny, because for most of my life it was so not true. It was like a reverse joke. But, yeah, I'm crazy. I'm totally crazy. It's true. All of my family members are crazy, too. There's a lot in a name. \n\nSTUFF: What's the strangest thing you've ever gotten stuck in that gap between your front teeth?  \n  \nJORJA: I'd have to say rocks. A couple of rocks, I was camping, it was dark, I was caught up in the moment and I got some rocks in my teeth. \n\nSTUFF: Rocks. Your face was in the dirt?  \n  \nJORJA: Gently, but yes. \n\nSTUFF: What are some of your vices, besides the cigarette you're smoking right now?  \n  \nJORJA: Ha! Well, I stay up really late, I drink coffee and alcohol and I like to be bad. Bad! But I don't have so many vices. \n\nSTUFF: What kind of drink could I buy you?  \n  \nJORJA: A beer. I would really be impressed. A bottle of beer. Nice beer - a microbrew. No glass. Amber is my favorite. \n\nSTUFF: You play guitar: Have you ever gone to a store and tried out a new guitar by playing \"Stairway to Heaven\"?  \n  \nJORJA: No, but I do know how to play \"Stairway to Heaven\". I've seen people do that. Once or twice I've even taken them outside and let them know that it's probably not all that cool. \n\nSTUFF: You're a self-described liberal. Will you use your fame to save the world? \n\n  \nJORJA: Wow! I would sure love to try. \n\nSTUFF: Where would you start?  \n  \nJORJA: Honestly? Two places: the environment, to be very serious, and sex. \n\nSTUFF: Sex.  \n  \nJORJA: I think \"Make love, not war\" might be the most profound statement that's ever been made. If people were spending more time having sex, they'd be a lot less inclined to be violent. \n\nSTUFF: Thanks. \n\n  \nJORJA: You're not going to ask me what my favorite dildo is or something? \n\n",

She's the kind of Hollywood Success Story that seems, well, almost suspect.\n\nThey call her the lucky charm. First, Jorja Fox was gun-toting intern Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER. Then she was Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano, who protected the president's daughter on The West Wing. When both of those story lines ended, Fox went on to play forensic-science hotshot Sara Sidle on CBS's smash hit CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (Thursdays, 9 P.M./ET). The actress with the angelic face and raspy voice has hopscotched to yet another hit series. \"She's like out talisman,\" says costar Gary Dourdan, who plays criminalist Warrick Brown, \"because she's been on all these great dramas.\"\n\nThe fun for CSI viewers is following the crew as they unravel the mysteries behind assorted revolting crime scenes: lacerated bodies in shopping carts, corpses whose mouths are stuffed with apples. For Fox, 33, dealing with the nitty-gritty role can take its toll. \"It isn't even the blood and guts [that really get to me],\" she says over a brunch of a chocolate croissant and cappuccino. \"It's the violence. There's such an emptiness of soul.\"\n\nAm intriguing combination of a big-city and small-town girl, Fox was born the younger of two children (her brother is 12 years older) in New York City and raised from age 3 in Melbourne Beach, Florida. Her bother is a 78-year-old retired paper-products salesman; her mother, an Air Canada reservations agent, died of ovarian cancer at age 69 in 1996. \"My mom was a child of the Depression,\" Fox says. \"The thing that gave her the most joy was feeding us. We were eating six meals a day.\"\n\nAt 14, a crush on an older boy helped Fox tackle what had become a serious weight problem (152 pounds at age 12). At 15, the newly slim, self-described \"messy tomboy\" shocked everyone by willing a shopping-mall modeling contest. Fox subsequently returned to New York, where she lived in a residence for models while working and completing high school. She used her earnings over the next three years to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, among other schools. \"My mother had wanted to be a painter and my father a writer. They didn't do any of those things,\" she says, \"but they really supported me.\"\n\nIt is especially poignant that in 1996 her mother was diagnosed with cancer when Fox landed her \"dream role\" on ER. That was the last thing Marilyn Fox ever saw Jorja do. \"I was having the biggest personal crisis and the greatest professional thing happening at the same time,\" she says.\n\nThe loss affected her deeply &#8212; and CSI reminds her of it often. \"It's always surprising how close [death] is,\" she says. And Fox worries that her 12-14 hour days are hurting her relationships with the people who are still here. \"Sometimes, I feel like I'm a terrible daughter, a terrible friend,\" Fox says quietly. \"If you're lucky, people stick around.\"\n\nThat kind of insecurity may explain why Fox, who's dating a film actor (whom she won't name), has yet to marry. \"I've had some really great affairs, but I'm allergic to marriage,\" she says.\n\nThis summer, Fox is visiting her dad in Florida before she takes a European vacation. And she hopes her lock will still hold. She calls CSI \"the best job ever.\" Could she do it in real life? No way, says costar William Petersen, who remembers a white-knuckled Fox clutching his arm during a helicopter ride over the Nevada desert during one episode. \"She has a very delicate stomach,\" he says. \"She doesn't even like looking at crime photos.\"\n\n",

You can see that they're attracted to each other! Do you think that Grissom and Sara should date despite their age difference? ? Karen\n\nMatt: I think dating would be a huge mistake for CSI, but not because I'm an ageist or anything. This isn't (thankfully) NYPD Blue, where the entire office seems to be pairing off with each other. Keeping the attraction muted, as subtext, allows us to be fascinated by the possibilities. Both characters are pretty well defined as somewhat anti-social loners who occasionally pine for a fuller life. If they began a romantic relationship, I think it would diminish our interest in their interactions almost immediately. Best just to be left wondering. \n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nOne person's death is another person's breath. That's something Jorja Fox knows everything about. The part of a forensic investigator on the television show C.S.I. has introduced her to a large audience. We talked to the American actress about her own life and her love/hate-relationship with death.\n\nThat she would ever be standing next to dead bodies that aren't even cold yet, for a living, surprises Jorja more than anyone. The thirty-three year old actress slowly but surely made her way up to Hollywood. Thanks to relatively small, but outstanding roles in shows like &#8216;ER' and &#8216;West Wing', Jorja has managed to make a name for herself. When you get to know her a bit better, you will find that Jorja is just as unconventional as the characters she portrayed throughout the years. In &#8216;ER', she played Maggie Doyle (\"I was a lesbian, but still had a mouth as sharp as a machinegun.\"), she was in the famous coming-out-episode of &#8216;Ellen', in &#8216;West Wing' she was seen as a clever cop and in the movie &#8216;Memento' she portrayed Guy Pierce's dead wife. (\"Even the actors didn't know what that movie was about when they started it.\")\n\nFoxy Woman\n\nNow, every week in C.S.I., she stoops over the strangled, the shot, the stabbed and the other gruesomely murdered. Not bad for a girl that, for a long time, lived a gypsy's life with her parents, an Irishman and a Belgian woman who moved to the States just before Jorja was born. \"My parents were incredibly restless,\" she says about that period in her life. \"My mother needed to move every other year. If possible to another country, but if there was no other possibility, we would just move into the house on the other side of the street.\" The only constant factor in the Fox family was mom's cooking; she put five meals together every day. As a result, Jorja weighed about 140 pounds at the age of twelve. \"I was huge,\" Jorja exclaims. \"I was horribly bullied in school. And if that wasn't bad enough already, my mother bought me this whole stack of oversized t-shirts that said &#8216;Foxy Woman'. I felt miserable.\" She finally lost the extra weight as the result of a long term crush. \"That was the first time I realised you can eat three meals a day, instead of five. That was a revelation!\"\n\nWith her new slender figure, she felt confident enough to enter the Miss Melbourne Beach beauty peageant in Florida, where she lived at the time. And what nobody expected, happened: Jorja won. \"Picture me standing there; stick thin, pale and with dark hair, when all the other girls were voluptuous, tanned blondes.\" Her triumph gave her enough confidence to register with a professional modeling agency. It turned out to be the beginning of a wonderful period.\n\n\"It's great to be a model. It's good pay, you get to travel all over the world and you meet lots of different people,\" Jorja says. But her ambitions went beyond the lens of the photocamera. She took actinglessons, started her own theater production company Honeypot and went to as many auditions as she could. But the biggest step turned out to be moving from New York to Los Angeles. \"I thought LA would be terrible,\" Jorja says, laughing. \"To me, it was a city for people who are willing to sell their soul to the devil, just to become a star. But by now, I've figured out that that's nonsense. I met a lot of warm and sensitive people here.\"\n\nIt wasn't much later though that Jorja had to deal with some rough times. Just when her career started to take off, her mother died of cancer. \"I was really depressed, but at the same time I was doing better than ever, professionally. At a time like that, all you can do is make the best you can of your life. It's useless to keep looking back at the past.\"\n\nWeak stomach\n\nFor the role of Sara Sidle in C.S.I., which is set in Las Vegas, Jorja regularly resides in a dried out desert in California, where a set is build. Staying over there has brought the cast closer together. \"There's absolutely nothing to do there,\" Jorja explains. \"So we really don't have any other choice than to go grab a beer in the evenings. We talk about ourselves, but also about the job. At first, I wasn't even sure whether they were going to let me stay, since they only asked me for three episodes. I made about two hundred dollars for one episode!\" In spite of the often gaunt storylines of the show, the colleagues have a lot of fun in between (or during) scenes. \"I think it's fascinating, all those dead bodies with outrageous injuries. There's something grotesque about death.\" And even though her co-actor William Petersen states that Jorja doesn't even have the stomach to look at those injuries, as far as Jorja's concerned, the show could use even more death and decay. \"I've pushed my limits on many ocassions. There have been a couple of episodes that really walked the line in picturing brutal violence. But I don't have any boundaries. The more &#8216;gore', the better. And a little more sex in the show wouldn't be such a bad idea, either! I think it would be kinda exciting actually, out there in the morgue.\"\n\nPersonal file  \n  \nName: Jorja-An Fox, Jorjan for short. She changed it to Jorja later.  \n  \nDate of Birth: July 7th, 1968, in New York.  \n  \nCurriculum Vitae: Jorja starred in &#8216;ER', &#8216;West Wing', and had a small part in Memento.  \n  \nFun facts: Jorja has been a vegetarian for years and wants to become a vegan one day. She owns a boxer named Ali, and two cats, Sid and Rumplestiltskin.  \n  \nCivil Status: Is dating an actor who's name she won't mention.\n\n",

        "content": "\n*1996 saw an \"explosion\" of lesbians on TV compared to previous years: we were introduced to *lesbian twenty-something Rhonda Roth on the new (and short-lived) series [http://www.afterellen.com/TV/relativity.html Relativity], Paul's sister came out on Mad About You, Roseanne's mom came out on Roseanne, lesbian Officer Abby Sullivan joined NYPD Blue-and Dr. Maggie Doyle became the first lesbian to join the staff of the hit NBC series [http://www.afterellen.com/TV/er.html ER], then in its third season.\n\nDoyle (played by Jorja Fox, currently on CSI) is a new intern in the ER, a vegetarian, street-smart daughter of a cop with a red BMW and no-bullshit attitude. Over the next three seasons, her extreme self-confidence and willingness to challenge authority occasionally get her into trouble at work, but her passion and willingness to help others wins her friends, too. In particular, Doyle and fellow resident John Carter develop a friendly and mutually supportive working relationship, and she also befriends (heterosexual) HIV+ nurse Jeanie Boulet.\n\n*Doyle's passion, activism, and willingness to work around the system are established early on. *In the first part of the third season, Doyle alerts law enforcement to a pregnant woman who tried to drink her baby to death, and when chastised by [http://www.afterellen.com/TV/sandylopez.html Dr. Weaver] for doing so, retorts \"How about this? If I get to testify against the bitch, I'll do it on my own time.\" \n\nIn another episode, Doyle secretly uses the office pool to buy a bus ticket for an abused woman trying to escape from her husband. She also publicly supports Jeanie's decision to come out as HIV+ to the rest of the hospital staff, and when Jeanie is fired by the hospital in the fourth season, Doyle puts her in touch with a Gay/Lesbian Defense Fund lawyer and urges her to sue the hospital for discrimination. \n\nIn true *ER* fashion, Doyle's sexuality is concealed for the first several episodes, *then finally *revealed halfway through the season in the February 6, 1997 episode \"Whose Appy Now?\" when Carter asks her out. She invites him to the shooting range with her instead, and while they're in target practice, she spies her ex-girlfriend Amy (a cop) and mentions to Carter that they just broke up three months ago and that Amy is \"jealous as hell.\" \n\nThat is the extent of the conversation about Doyle's sexuality, and this is actually the only time we ever see a girlfriend or ex-girlfriend of Doyle's.\n\nOn the surface, Doyle appears to be just one of many lesbian characters on TV without a life, the stereotypical television lesbian-in-name-only that was common on network television up until the last few years: despite remaining on the series for three years, we never see Doyle with a girlfriend, or even hear her talk about one after the target practice scene with Carter. \n\nThere are only two other times, in fact, when Doyle's lesbianism is even mentioned-in the beginning of the fourth season when Carter asks Doyle if she's showing favoritism towards the new female intern, to which Doyle just laughs, and then in the fifth season when Doyle comments \"guess he thought anything goes with the gay chick\" in reference to the sexual harassment she was subjected to by a male doctor, whom she later filed charges against. When asked by another doctor if she thought filing these charges would hurt her career, Doyle just shrugs it off with \"self-respect is a bitch.\"\n\nThere were a few other cryptic (and humorous) references to her lesbianism over her three-season run, **which established Doyle's quirky personality, such as in this **exchange between a group of doctors and nurses in the third season:\n\nChuney: Malibu Barbie was my favorite, too.  \nMark: I was always partial to Ken.  \nLouise: Ken?  \nMark: You don't like Ken?  \nLouise: Too pretty.  \nDoyle: I'm with you, Louise. Ken's nothing but trouble.\n\nAnd another one later in the third season, when Carter tries one more time to ask Doyle out:\n\nCarter : You know, you're great.  \nDoyle : So are you.  \nCarter : Seriously...you're great...funny...beautiful, too. I don't suppose you would ...\nDoyle : Not a chance.  \nCarter : Cheers.\n\nAnd finally, in a scene at the end of the third season, Doyle quips to a deranged patient on a biblical rant \"No meat, no men-I'm your woman!\" as she arrives to help him.\n\n*No love life and only three references to her sexuality in three years could render Doyle just more *lesbian road kill on the television highway except for one thing: lack of a love life aside, Doyle is one of the most un-stereotypical lesbian characters in TV history.\n\nA woman who isn't interested in sleeping with men, helps another woman escape from her abusive relationship with a man, stands up to the male senior doctor who is harassing her and encourages another doctor to do the same, and encourages her HIV+ colleague to sue when she's discriminated against. A smart, confident feminist vegetarian lesbian who isn't afraid to stand up for herself and others, an educated and accomplished human-rights activist who has a gun collection, a street-smart daughter of a cop who can be alternately tough and compassionate.\n\nIn short, Maggie Doyle is institutionalized sexism's worst nightmare. \n\nAnd unlike many television lesbians who are clearly positioned as \"feminine\" in order to offset the potential threat of their lesbianism, you never see Doyle in makeup and heels, and the few times she does wear something other than hospital scrubs she is usually in something gender-neutral like jeans and a t-shirt (although this is typical of all of the female characters on *ER, *it is notable that Doyle isn't treated any differently from the heterosexual women in this regard).\n\n*This kind of rich, complicated, and anti-patriarchal character is not standard fare on television, *and not surprisingly, there have been few such lesbian characters on network television* before or since. *\n\nLesbianism on television* *is* *almost always divorced from feminism or from activism of any kind in order to make it as palatable as possible to the general public, since a feminist lesbian is the embodiment of everything American patriarchal culture finds threatening. Therefore, to create such a character on television is extremely risky; to make her a likeable character without compromising her feminist characteristics is a huge challenge.\n\nBecause this is so risky, lesbianism on network television is usually presented as just an issue of sexuality, in which television writers labor to reinforce the idea that lesbians are \"just like the rest of us\" except that they sleep with other women. This applies to almost every lesbian character on television in the last twenty years, but specific examples include the lesbian couple on Friends, Ellen's characters in both of her sitcoms, Rhonda on Relativity and Debbie Buchman on Mad About You, and almost every lesbian in a TV movie including The Truth About Jane and What Makes a Family.\n\nAnd while this \"just like everyone else\" descriptor does accurately describe the way many lesbians see themselves in real life, it doesn't necessarily apply to all (or even most) lesbians.\n\nParadoxically, the persistent use of the \"lesbians are just like us\" messaging on TV *has* helped pave the way for more lesbian characters on TV, but it is also slowly eroding the connection between feminism and lesbianism. This of course is exactly the result television networks are hoping for, and the very reason they have propagated it; lesbianism without feminism is the ultimate male fantasy-and serving up male fantasy is what drives television ratings.\n\nAnd while it may be that for many lesbians, their sexuality is not in fact related to feminism, I'm pretty sure we don't want the television networks making that decision for us. \n\n*In this environment, Dr. Maggie Doyle is not only an anomaly on television, but potentially revolutionary. *Unfortunately, this revolutionary potential is probably one of the reasons her character was never really fully developed on ER. Doyle was never a primary cast member, but over time she was relegated more and more to the periphery of the storyline, until she finally just didn't come back in the sixth season. \n\nTo make her a full cast member would have required devoting more screen time to her personal life and to the lesbian feminist issues she cares about, and while the writers at ER have pushed the envelope in terms of lesbian representation more than once, they are still products of their ratings-ruled environment in which lesbian feminists don't generate huge audience response. And if there's anything more threatening than a lesbian feminist on TV, it's a lesbian feminist in a happy relationship. \n\nThere have been other complex, realistic and even feminist lesbian characters on network television (including the current lesbian characters on ER and *[http://www.afterellen.com/TV/buffy.html Buffy]), *and unlike Doyle, they are actually allowed to have on-screen relationships. But none have embodied quite the same activist spirit as Doyle, the same desire to take on the system; as long as American culture retains its sexist and homophobic roots, this may remain true for awhile to come.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote: episode details and photos provided by JorjaFox.net; the site also lists TNT's schedule of ER repeats if you want to catch Doyle in action",

        "content": "\nvegetarian girl next door catapults to stardom\n\nAs a star on the top-rated CBS police drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja (pronounced Georgia) Fox as to watch what she eats. Not or health reasons- although nutrition certainly is important to the devoted vegetarian- but becuase of the show's sometimes gory realism. \"I've learned not to eat before certain scenes,\" she says.\n\nThat's hardly surprising give the fact that Fox's character, Sara Sidle- a name that, she says, \"sounds a little too much like 'suicidal'\"- works as a member of the CSI autopsy team. Her job? Examining the lifeless bodies discovered in the dark hours of the night in Las Vegas and uncovering clues about the who, what, where, when and why of their demise.\n\nSidle is just the latest in a string of serious, determined characters that fox has portrayed on the big and small screens. She joined the cast of ER in its third season as the gun-toting, vegetarian, gay resident, Dr. Maggie Doyle- \"No meat. No men. I'm your woman.\" She appeared in The West Wing as special agent Gina Toscano, the dedicated secret service protector of the president's daughter. And in her most recent film, the critically acclaimed Memento, she played the murder victim, a role that entailed lying for hours on a bathroom floor, wet, covered by a shower curtain.\n\nBy following Fox's career, you might assume you know a thing or two about her from the characters she's played. You know the look: the tall, lithe brunette with the slight space between her front teeth. You recognize the voice: a hint of the tomboy all grown up. You feel the persona: girl always up for a wind-in-her-hair kind of adventure, followed maybe by a pizza and beed. And, yes, she is both an animal lover and a vegetarian, a detail that has been written into some of the characters she protrays.\n\nThat's Jorja Fox, it's true. But the person behind the role is someone else again- a distinct character with a storyline all her own.\n\nmodel citizen  \n  \nA New Your City native, Fox spent most of her childhood in Melbourne Beach, Florida, on a barrier island with the ocean on one side and a river on the other. \"My life was all about water- sailing, water-skiing, swimming, surfing. It's where I developed my passion for being outside. It was simply a wonderful place to be a kid. I grew up barefoot.\"\n\nThe family- which includes an older brother- had moved south to fulfull Fox's mother's dream of living in a beach town. But they were a restless group, changing residences often and taking frequent trips to New York City and Canada, where Fox's parents hail from.\n\nAs it turns out, it was in Flordia that Fox met her destiny, winning by a fluke, she says, a modeling contest she entered as a joke. \"I was very, very, very shocked to win,\" she says. \"I was a fish out of water becuase I wasn't a classic beauty. In Florida, beauty was all about being blond and tan. I'm a tall, gangly, dark-haired Irish girl. I just didn't fit the bill.\" But her beauty was recognized nevertheless, and at 15 she won the oppertunity to live in New York City and give modeling a try.\n\nAfter a summer spent living with another teenage model and a chaperone, Fox decided there was no going back. She opted to stay in New York, finish high school and pursue modeling. Her career focused primarily on print media- magazines in particular. \"I'm too short for runway work,\" she says. \"I only worked the runway when someone else called in sick.\" Another impediment to success on the catwalk? The once-barefoot girl \"could barely walk in heels.\"\n\nFrom New York she went to Europe, where, she says, she felt \"fearless.\" Those years of modeling and traveling throughout Europe with peers were \"fantastic, a wilder dream than I ever could have imagined,\" she says. After a time, however, Fox decided that modeling had its limitations.\n\nReturning to New York at 18, she turned her attention to acting, focusing on studying and auditioning. She adopted an eclectic approach to supporting herself: working at a kennel, as a temp and even as a coat checker in a downtown nightclub.\n\nBut her fast-paced city lifestyle never diminished her love of the outdoors, and she continued to run for exercise and bike just to get places she needed to go. \"I rode everwhere. It just seemed like a normal thing to do. Besides, I was broke.\"\n\nAlong the way, Fox began to examine the way she'd been eating. A lifelong meat-and-potatoes lover, she constantly peppered her vegetarian friends with questions about their dietary habits. Then one day in Brooklyn- in the midst of consuming a meatball sub- she had an epiphany. \"I just got it. I made a connection. I started reading voraciously about vegetarianism, and got ready for the questions from others, like the ones I'd asked my friends.\" Fifteen years later, Fox says eating a meat-free diet is just something she does without questioning.\n\nsweet success\n\n  \nAt age 19, Fox got her first movie role in The Kill-Off, a dark and disturbing independant film that was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. And soon after, other roles started coming her way. \"By age 25, I knew I could make a living as an actor,\" she says.\n\nAt 34, she has ample proof that she was right. Her resume includes stints on the best and brightest of what's on the small screen. in addition to her roles on ER and The West Wing, Fox has also appeared on Law & Order, the \"coming out\" episode of Ellen, and in such films as The Jerky Boys, Dead Funny and The Hungry Bachelor's Club.\n\nNow, Fox throws herself into the role as the work-obsessed, relationship-impaired Sidle, a hard-nosed scientist raised by two ex-hippies in rural Northern California. According to her character sketch, Fox's current alter ego \"can solve any problem except how she's supposed to relate to others.\" Her character plunges into her work becuase she's afraid of what she'd have to face if she slowed down. She pursues the mysteries of death because those of life are more discomforting.\n\nFox's own character sketch would read quite differently. She's devoted to work and life in equal measure, and has no trouble connecting with myriad living, breathing creatures. She exudes energy, enthusiasm and, in contrast to her serious television demeanor, a light-hearted, let's-have-some-fun approach to life. Her passions are many- being outdoors, getting in her car and heading out on the open road, surfing, live music, spending time with friends and the company on her animals- two cats rescued from shelters, and one dog, a boxer aptly named Ali.\n\nTo keep up with all of her interests, coupled with CSI's grueling schedule- few weeks and often unpredictable hours- Fox needs endurance. When she's filming, she may put in five long weekdays plus Saturday, either on the set north of Los Angeles or on location in Las Vegas. Each workday can last anywhere from six to fifteen hours; her starting and quitting times vary greatly. \"Sometimes filming starts at 7 a.m., other days it starts at 6 p.m. One day I may be done at 5:30 p.m., other days 5:30 a.m. A lot of times I don't know in advance,\" she says.\n\nhealth matters  \n  \nGiven the demands of starring in a weekly television series, Fox has to be prepared for anything- and she is: \"I'm adaptable. I like the flexability.\" Not one to adhere to a rigid routine, she has learned that she needs to respect her internal rhythms to keep up her stamina. \"I've learned to sleep when I'm tired and eat when I'm hungry.\"\n\nOne thing she isn't flexible about, however, is her healthy diet. Although Fox was a vegan for six months when she lived in Chicago, that lifestyle is more difficult to adhere to lately. \"I work so much that I depend on others to cook for me,\" she says. \"I still don't eat much dairy, just a little cream in my tea, but I eat tons of eggs, now that they have cage-free organic ones.\"\n\nAs for the benefits of a vegetarian diet: \"I noticed that during the first five years of being a vegetarian, I felt much lighter, although I only dropped three or four pounds. I liked that lightness,\" she says.\n\nBut Fox's healthy habits go far beyond diet. She is, she says, a faithful reader of Better Nutrition, and she takes her own health very seriously. She's always careful to boost her immune system, particularly during the filming season. \"I take a decent amnount of supplements- a B complex, a mineral complex, digestive enzymes, astragalus and vitamin C. I don't want to get run-down,\" which is bound to happen with the schedule she keeps and the close quarters in which she works. \"The cramped stages don't have a tremendous amount of ventilation,\" she says. \"It's like being at school and one kid shows up with a cold, and you just know everyone is going to get it. Same thing on the set. I hear someone sneeze and I say, 'Oh, here we go.'\"\n\nShe also exercises when she can. \"I'm not a gym person,\" she says. So when she works out- every other weekday and twice on weekends- she does it either in the fresh air of the privacy of her home. \"I put on a CD and dance for 45 minutes,\" she says.\n\nHer favorite workout partner is Ali, the boxer, who's always up for a run whenever she is, which more than likely is late in the evening. While the two of them often go for a run at 10 p.m., after working, you'll never see them out before the sun rises. \"I'm not a morning person,\" says Fox, \"I wake up slowly.\"\n\non the go\n\n  \nDespite the struggle to get out of bed each morning, Fox unfailingly shows up to breathe life into Sidle, a key player on the CSI autopsy team and a role that Fox embodies with pleasure. \"I love my character,\" she says. \"She's so smart. She's at the top of her game. Every day is a learning experience.\"\n\nFox is self-deprecating when comparing herself to the character she plays, denying that she's as smart as Sidle, who has a B.S. in physics from Harvard and did graduate work in theoretical physics. \"I just love being able to say that,\" she says. Unlike her alter ego, Fox claims that she has finite space in her short-term memory. \"As an actor,\" she says, \"I don't retain a tremendous amount. I do six scenes a day, and there's not that much room in my memory for more. I learn the lines, then I clear them out and learn others.\"\n\nBut, in fact, she has learned more that she lets on. After all, it takes skill to appear believable when conducting a dramatic rendition of an autopsy.\n\nHaving lived on both coasts, Fox is pleased with the peripateic life she leads. \"I'm a bit gypsy-ish.\" As long as she can be outside- at the beach, hiking- she's happy. \"That's why I love running; you can do it anywhere. It travels well.\" She's also a dedicated surper, riding the ways several times a month, more during hiatus from her show.\n\nDuring her infrequent breaks from fliming CSI, Fox devotes hersel to Honeypot Productions, a small acting troupe that she co-founded. This is where she truly expresses herself, she says, by writing for and acting in live threater. So far Honeypot has staged five different shows, two of them written by Fox and all of them performed outdoors. \"We put on plays that no one would pay us to do. We stage them in friends' backyards.\" She stops to laugh. \"No one has volunteered a yard for next season, but I think there's one person who just might be willing.\"\n\nIf Fox's skyrocketing career is any indication, those backyard plays are sure to launch into Broadway productions. Stay tuned.  \n",

        "content": "\n(CBS) Every week, the cast and crew of \"C.S.I.\" find themselves immersed in  \nbone-chilling tales, made even more haunting by the music that accompanies  \neach scene, reports The Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen.\n\nWhile \"C.S.I.\" is famous for its high-tech gadgets, the music on the show  \nis also cutting edge.\n\n\"We try to choose the edgiest, coolest, hippest music,\" says the show's  \nexecutive producer, Anthony Zucker. \"As we watch these shows in the editing  \nroom, we sort of talk about, 'Let's put some interrogation-type music there  \nor some great string.' Anything sort of eerie and creepy.\"\n\nFrom techno to tribal, Zucker knows the magic of finding the right sound.\n\nHe says he can see the television character Grissom looking at different  \nbugs and different gestations of the bugs and add the music and sounds  \nnaturally.\n\nSeries stars Gary Dourdan and Jorja Fox are also music lovers. A lunch  \nbreak often turns into a jam session. But, the music isn't just fun. It's  \ntherapeutic, because it provides the cast an escape from the disturbing  \ndrama.\n\n\"Some of the stories are based on real life stories,\" says Dourdan. \"That's  \nhaunting.\"\n\n\"If I read the scripts before I go to bed, I have nightmares,\" says Fox.  \n\"And usually by the end of the season, when we get ready to break, it's all  \nabout 'PG' ? happy entertainment.\"\n\nFox says the two actors listen to music to get in the mood for the dark  \nseries.\n\n\"Sometimes I listen to some really heavy hip hop,\" says Dourdan, who  \nexplains the aggressiveness can help get him into the mood to act in the  \ndrama.\n\n\"I listen to rock 'n' roll music,\" says Fox. \"But, I love everything. I  \nlove soul. I love Blues. I love Motown. My character's from San Francisco,  \nso I can't deny the whole sort of late Sixties, summer of love thing.\"\n\nDourdan says he and Fox sing on set, as well.\n\n\"I'm a horrible singer,\" says Fox. \"I don't know why he's encouraging me to  \nsing.\"\n\n\"She's great,\" counters Dourdan.\n\n\"But I love to sing,\" says Fox. \"The problem is that I love it and I do it  \nall the time.\"\n\nThe music of \"C.S.I.\" is now available in stores as a compilation CD. And  \nfor those who can't get enough of Dourdan, he's hard at work on his own CD  \nto be released later this year on his record label, \"Metisse.\"\n\nTo watch \"C.S.I.\" tune to the CBS network Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET\n\n",

        "content": "\nWhen teenager Jorjan Fox left Melbourne Beach for good, midway through her senior year in December 1985, she had no idea where she was going. Well, to New York City, for sure, but beyond that, it was a shot in the dark. \n\nThe resume was modest. She had taken modeling classes as a kid, done a little drama work in high school, and she'd had a couple of brief glimpses of gore as an emergency-room volunteer. She couldn't hack math and science. Maybe she'd be a rock star; she liked to play guitar. Anyhow, Fox left Brevard to chase big dreams in the big city. \n\nEighteen years later, the trail in the rear-view is bright and clear. Culture vultures know her as Dr. Maggie Doyle on \"ER,\" Secret Service agent Gina Toscano on \"The West Wing\" and, more recently, forensics analyst Sara Sidle on CBS' brainy/macabre hit series \"CSI,\" which just completed its third season. She had a cameo as a lesbian in the ground-breaking \"Ellen\" coming-out episode, and students of the arcane will remember her as the murder victim in Chris Nolan's nightmarish 2000 film \"Memento.\" \n\nIt's a long way from Melbourne, but by phone from her home outside Los Angeles, Jorja Fox (she dropped the \"n\" at the beginning of her acting career) has fond memories of her formative years. She was only 3 when her mom and dad &#8212; Canadian immigrants Mark and Marilyn Fox &#8212; relocated to Brevard in 1972 from her birthplace in New York City. Dad sold paper products. \"Mom's dream was to live by the beach somewhere,\" Fox says. \n\nFox attended Gemini Elementary, Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy, Hoover Junior High and Melbourne High during her 13 years here. She was also a candy striper at Holmes Regional Medical Center, and her brother Jeff, 12 years her senior, was once a member of the Melbourne Beach Volunteer Fire Department. \n\nMarilyn Fox died from cancer in 1996, and Mark Fox now lives in South Florida. Her only connections to Brevard these days are those occasional Mel-Hi alums who migrate into the California entertainment industry. For instance, she recently ran into MHS grad Kevin Green, a producer for the CBS reality serial, \"Survivor.\" The two used to ride the school bus together. \n\nIf minor, even capricious, decisions assume huge proportions with perspective, then Fox's half-hearted impulse to enter a fashion show at Melbourne Square mall in 1984 probably qualifies as one of the earliest connected dots on the road to Hollywood. Looking back on it, the 34-year-old, former punk-culture devotee can only chuckle. \"Winning that contest,\" she says, \"was the fluke of the year.\" \n\nIn several magazine articles supplied by a Los Angeles publicity agency, Fox stated that anger was one her easiest emotions to access for a role. Indeed, when she attended Mel-Hi, her attitude caught the attention of English and drama teacher Leslie Gabe. Gabe went on to cast Fox in two starkly contrasting productions: the romantic comedy \"Pillow Talk\" and \"Juvie,\" a bleak drama about life in a juvenile detention center. \n\n\" 'Pillow Talk' didn't seem like a natural fit for her,\" says Gabe, who worked Fox into the lead character played by Doris Day in the 1959 film. \"The only other role she'd played was in 'Juvie,' and the lead was a girl who was dark and angry. That was the persona Jorjan liked to project until you got to know her better. She had an aura about her, a little bit of a wall that kept people at a distance.\" \n\nTo this day, Fox &#8212; who says she'd never make a good crime-scene investigator in real life because of her squeamishness &#8212; isn't sure where that edge came from. \n\n\"I was in trouble a lot in high school, but it wasn't anything serious,\" she recalls. \"Things like walking around with headphones on, which was against the rules. I didn't understand why. Maybe it was just being in a small town. There are a lot more ways to push the envelope in a small town.\" \n\nFox calls Gabe \"a fantastic teacher\" and credits her for introducing her to the stage. In fact, the \"Pillow Talk\" experience landed Fox in a \"limited distribution\" film comedy called \"Tierra Tango\" some years back when the casting director turned out to be an avid Doris Day fan. \n\nToday, in the lull between startup production on the fourth season of \"CSI\" in July and the release of an indie film entitled \"Down With the Joneses\" (in which she plays \"a desperate, angry, used-up wife\"), Fox works on plays with a group of friends calling themselves Honeypot Productions. \n\nThere's not much of a window to work with. \"CSI\" didn't finish taping its third season until April. \n\nAnd lately, there's a notion to master surfing, which is something she didn't do much of when she was living on the Space Coast. Maybe that's part of the reason why Fox &#8212; a pale, dark-haired kid who decided to compete in modeling against the more conventional, blond, tanned, surfer-girl types &#8212; regards what happened at the Melbourne mall all those years ago as something of a watershed event. \n\nNow a serious vegetarian, Jorja Fox says she was \"obese\" in the seventh grade, and decided to change her look when she developed a crush on an older guy. She dropped the weight and got lean, but never fully bought into conforming to anyone else's expectations. \n\n\"I'll never forget when we were doing 'Pillow Talk.' It was the first time anyone had seen Jorjan out of character, so to speak,\" Gabe says. \"She was wearing a dress and makeup and heels and everybody said, 'My god &#8212; you look so pretty!' \" \n\nSo it was almost on a dare that she bowed to a friend's insistence and signed up for the mall competition. There were \"at least 200 people there, maybe more,\" Fox says. \"I really didn't do anything to prepare. I was wearing shorts and a tank top.\" \n\nIt went pretty quickly. She spoke to a couple of judges and did a turn. And she won first place in a field of stereotypes. The reward was a free photo portfolio, plus an opportunity to train at the Elite agency in New York City. But Fox didn't beat a path to the airport. \n\n\"I actually sat on that thing for about a year, because I wasn't sure it was something I really wanted to do. I waited until the following summer to go to New York, and I was up there on my own. I loved it,\" she says. \"After that summer, it was really hard to go back (to Melbourne Beach).\" \n\nWhen her parents decided to return to New York in 1985, Fox eagerly followed them, even though it left her a semester short of graduating with her class at Mel-Hi. She went on to study at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she found her calling. \n\nShe broke through nationally in 1993 with cop drama \"Missing Persons,\" starring Daniel Travanti. The show was short-lived, but she made her mark. By 2001, TV Guide was naming her as one of the \"51 Hottest Stars on TV.\" \n\n\"Jorjan was very, very smart,\" Gabe says. \"I could see her being a success in whatever she dedicated herself to doing. But I think of all the very talented and dedicated people who've come through (Mel-Hi) and tried tomake it (in show biz). The odds are so against them. Sometimes I almost think you need something more. It's as if the stars have to be aligned for things to go so well.\" \n\nFor now, the erstwhile high-school rebel is apparently comfortable with her place in the galaxy. She shares workout tips with Fitness and Self, confides makeup secrets with In Style, and vamps in photo spreads for Stuff, which calls her \"TV's Sexiest Scientist.\" \n\nYet, when asked how she'd advise kids to work through image problems through those jittery teenage years, Fox retains a soft spot for the misfits. \n\n\"At the end of the day, it's really important for you to follow your own heart about what you're really interested in,\" she says. \"Kids feel so much pressure to fit it, but it's important to understand that the things about you that don't fit in are what's really going to set you apart. It's what makes you special. Be yourself. People will notice. And they'll remember.\" \n\nJorja's journey\n\nFilms  \n  \n\"Down with the Joneses\" (to be released this year)  \n  \n\"Forever Fabulous\" (2000)  \n  \n\"Memento\" (2000)  \n  \n\"The Hungry Bachelors Club\" (1999)  \n  \n\"How to Make the Cruelest Month\" (1998)  \n  \n\"Velocity Trap\" (1997)  \n  \n\"The Jerky Boys\" (1995)  \n  \n\"Dead Funny\" (1994)  \n  \n\"Dead Drunk\" (1992)  \n  \n\"Happy Hell Night\" (1992) \n\nTelevision  \n  \n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (2000-present)  \n  \n\"The West Wing\" (1999)  \n  \n\"Alchemy\" (1997)  \n  \n\"House of Frankenstein 1997\"  \n  \n\"ER\" (1994)  \n  \n\"Missing Persons\" (1993)  \n  \n\"Summer Stories: The Mall\" (1992)\n\n",

But if you want to know about something that appears to be far more simple, say a personal relationship between the CSI team's aloof boss, Gil Grissom and TV's sexiest scientist Sara Sidle you can apply the same rule. \n\nDanny Cannon a series executive producer and frequent director, says Grissom will \"become more engaged with the world\" as the show continues. \n\n\"You keep hearing that from writers, right?\" Petersen, 50, responds when asked to explain the phrase. \"I dont know what that means either, but I heard it, too. I think one thing Grissom has learned is that he either has much to learn or much to forget. I think he's very strong but he has his limitations and he focuses on what he's good at. It's not that he's never been out with a woman, it's just that he's never been in love with a woman, so that's not a priority for him.There's some change going on in him, some midlife situation he's going to have to address, but how he addresses it I have no idea.\" Petersen means, of course, that we should assume nothing. \n\n\"If he's smart he'll chase me, right?\" quips 35 year old Fox.\"I came in originally as a love interest for Grissom and there is a back story then they changed their minds on that. So we know there's some history between them but we dont really know what it is. Still I think the dance will be played out.\" Then Fox pauses and adds \"But I dont know for sure.\" \n\nTo Anthony Zuiker, who created CSI a romantic interlude between two of his main characters is a moot point anyway.\"We're a forensic procedural drama at heart,\" he says, a description which in itself would be likely to drain the romance out of anyone quicker than you can say \"scapel\". When we go into personal relationships in doses- I stress the word doses- it's so much richer when Jorja Fox wipes chalk off Billy Petersen's cheek, or he might call her 'honey'. It cames totally out of left field and when you hear those things it really gets everybody talking and excited versus us doing those beats constantly from page 0ne to page 60. It just wouldnt have the impact.\" So the balance between lab and love is likely to remain skewed heavily towars lab, althogh Zuiker of course adds: \"But in short, assume nothing.\" \n\n[...]\n\n",

I really hope that the split would  \nturn out into something positive.\" \n\n\"CSI,\" which is on its third season, is about a team of forensic  \ninvestigators, led by senior forensics officer Gil Grissom (William  \nPeterson), and the crimes they solve with high-tech gadgets by  \nassessing pieces of evidence gathered at the crime scene. \n\nFox, 34, who is based in California, describes \"CSI\" as \"an anti-  \nviolence series that presents people in the worst days of their lives.\"\n\n\"It's a show that has subjects most Americans would not want to talk  \nabout,\" she said. \n\nDespite the serious nature of the topics tackled in the show, \"CSI\"  \nis continuously garnering rave reviews in the US. \n\nFox attributes the show's success to the sense of security it  \nconveys to its viewers. \n\n\"It makes it look very difficult to get away from some crime,\" she  \nexplained. \n\nThe show's producers hired a team of technical advisers and arranged  \nfor crime laboratories in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to be open for cast  \nmembers of \"CSI\" to use, according to Fox. This, she said, is primarily  \nto help train the actors for their roles as forensic investigators. \n\n\"Reading medical trivia books also helped me understand my role  \nbetter,\" she said. \"I have always been fascinated with science.\" \n\nFox landed the role of Sara in a \"very traditional way.\" \n\n\"I went to the audition, read a part, and then left,\" she  \nrecalled. \"I got a call from one of the show's producers a few days  \nlater asking for a meeting.\" \n\nAfter two seasons, Fox has learned to adapt Sara's brazen attitude  \nand passion for work. \n\nShe used to get very queasy whenever Sara is made to stitch pigskin  \nor examine the contents of the stomach of a dead child. \n\n\"She is much smarter and courageous than I am,\" the actress said of  \nher CSI character. \"But I'm as focused as she is when it comes to my  \ncraft.\" \n\nFox started acting at age six, and was involved mostly with  \nindependent theater productions when she was in high school. \n\nShe first appeared on NBC's top-rated series \"ER\" as the lesbian  \nresident intern Dr. Maggie Doyle. She was also featured as the master  \nthief Pallas in the futuristic film \"Velocity Trap,\" and Delmar  \nYoungblood in \"Hungry Bachelors Club,\" a story about love and  \nfriendship. \n\nFox also played the role of secret service agent Gina Toscano in  \nAaron Sorkin's Emmy award-winning drama \"The West Wing.\" \n\nBut her role as Sara is one of Fox's prayers that have been  \nanswered. \n\n",

But backstage fights over what should happen between the characters played by William Petersen and Jorja Fox make the on-screen happenings seem like winter in Antarctica, say insiders.\n\n\"The production team has been torn apart,\" a source says.\n\n\"One group believes workaholic Grissom is so emotionally stunted that he could never have an affair and that's the way he should be played.\n\n\"But the rival faction is campaigning for some action between the sheets.\n\n\"They point out that after all, it's unrealistic to believe that when two available people flirt so much it won't lead to an affair.\n\n\"To have them flirt without a sexy outcome is like kissing your sister, and the viewers will start to yawn, they say.\"\n\nThe stars who play the two characters involved can't agree on how far to take things, either.\n\nPetersen, 50, wants the pair to explore their growing attraction, as long as it doesn't turn the show into a soap opera, say insiders.\n\nBut Fox, 35, believes that although their constant flirting is a great dynamic for creating tension, a segue into sex would detract from the show's strong stories.\n\nShe admits she'll be making goo-goo eyes at Grissom for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a very personal year for the characters,\" she reveals, \"more-so that we've ever done.\"\n\nThe backstage bickering over the steamy issue has spilled onto the Internet, where fans are airing their opinions online. And now that the new CSI season is in full swing, the debate is healing up.\n\nOne group of fans even posted an open letter to the shows producers, urging them to press ahead with the Grissom-Sara love match.\n\n\"We feel that a relationship would provide a human element to the show,\" the petition says.\n\nOther online fans agreed, licking their lips at the prospect of the two stodgy characters getting intimate for a change.\n\nBut some viewers are squarely against pairing up the investigators in the bedroom.\n\n\"It does nothing for the show,\" one disappointed fan complains.",

        "content": "\nONE question romantically inclined TV audiences never tire of asking is \"Will they or won't they?\"\n\nThese days, the most unlikely TV couple who's keeping them guessing is \" CSI: Crime Scene Investigation \" 's Sara Sidle and her boss, Gil Grissom, played by Jorja Fox and William Petersen. \n\nIf you've been focusing on the series' parade of autopsies rather than its more subtle relationship dynamics, you missed one of last season's most heartbreaking below-the-radar attempts at pairing off. \n\n\"I don't think we've seen the end of that story line,\" Fox told The Post. \n\n\"I think we're going to have a very personal year for the characters this year, more so than we've ever done.\" \n\nOnline chat rooms were ablaze with opinions of the budding romance, with one fan summing it up as follows: Either get together or not, but stop the big tease. \n\nThe chatter was obviously unaware that it's the big tease that rachets up interest and makes imaginations race overtime. \n\n\"Billy [Petersen] and I both love the fact that people have different takes on it,\" she said. \n\n\"It's kind of a little bit controversial. It takes on its own substance. People read into it what they want to.\" \n\nThe fictional Sidle, who has pretty much buried her feelings for Grissom, got rebuffed toward the end of last season when she tentatively expressed her wish that they take it further. \n\nFox says Grissom responds by basically telling Sidle, \"She 'wouldn't have the chance of going out with him,' ever! He didn't know what to do with it.\" \n\nSo, is Grissom a simpleton or does he suspect he might have a heart? \n\n\"I think he's very much aware of it,\" Fox said. \n\nNot that these two characters are paragons of relationship savvy. As one online fan wrote, they're \"two workaholics with poor social skills,\" which prompted Fox to explain that \"the show lends itself to that - so much of what they do is thinking.\" \n\nFox, 35, who made her mark playing \" ER \" 's feisty Dr. Maggie Doyle, concedes that this past season her CSI character has become a much more vulnerable character. \n\n\"I suffered a couple of really big blows for her personally,\" she said, referring to betrayals by a boyfriend and another friend, not to mention the explosion at the lab. And her feelings for Grissom. \n\nOutside of \"CSI,\" Fox is one of the core members of Honeypot Productions, a theater group that puts up shows in the open air during California summers. \n\nThe group has been putting its efforts into an original musical they're considering adapting as a film. But right now, it's back to the crime lab and new scripts. \n\n\"We're leaving it to the writers to follow their hearts, because they're always going to be annoying someone, so you can't win,\" she said.\n\n",

        "content": "\nCSI's Jorja Fox has a simple plan: Don't worry, be hippie.\n\nOut of the darkness of the CSI morgue, actress Jorja Fox lightens up as a guitar-toting, happy-go-lucky hippie.\n\nBetween the loss of her mother and *CSI's grim plots, \"I realize that the veil between life and death is thinner than I thought,\" says Fox ...*\n\nAsk Jorja Fox about the small gap between her front teeth, and she presses her lips together in mock sensitivity. Starting at 12, \"I worse braces for three years,\" says Fox, part of the crack forensics team on CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. \"Then my wisdom teeth were supposed to come in and push them together. That didn't work. By the time I was 20, I said forget it.\" Good thing. \"That's her Alfred E. Neuman smile,\" says costar George Eads, \"And I've never seen anyone wear it better.\"\n\nShe doesn't get to wear it much as driven, discontented criminalist Sara Sidle, on the top-rated show. Admits Fox: \"Sara does not have teriffic social skills.\" Unlike the actress herself, who enjoys clubbing and jams on electric guitar in a loft she and four pals lease as a studio. \"I prefer to stay on the lighter side of things,\" Fox, 34, says. \"She's a hippie,\" says costar Eric Szmanda. The vegetarian pleaded for a fake prop- \"which they probably would have done anyway,\" she admits- when a CSI script called for a decomposing pig. And on a trip to Yosemite, says her friend, commercial art director Andrea Campos, \"she actually hugged a tree.\"\n\nFox has embraced more roles than trees. Before CSI's debut in 200, she was familiar to viewers from three seasons as intense Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, followed by a year as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing. The success of CSI surprised her. \"I didn't think a show about death would do well.\" Of course, some viewers may tune in for her unfussed, husky sexiness. \"She's got this Lauren Bacall thing going on,\" says costar Gary Dourdan, \"with that raspy voice.\"\n\nThat comment would have made her blush as a tomboy growing up in melbourne, Fla., with her dad, Mark, 79, a now-retired salesman, mom, Marilyn, who died in '96, and an older brother Jeff, 46, now a financial sales manager in Atalanta. Living by the beach, \"I wore flip-flops to school until I was 13,\" says Jorja (pronounced Georgia- her mother liked the unusual spelling). She started acting in a local theater at 5, then lucked into a modeling contest at a mall while dressed in shorts and a T-shirt. \"I was a terrible model, awkward and gawky,\" she says. But work in New York and Europe paid for acting studies, and in 1993 Fox got her big break in ABC's short lived Missing Persons, shot in frigid Chicago. \"I wore so much winter clothing, my neighbors thought I was a construction worker.\"\n\nBy 1994 she was enjoying the warmth of L.A. but in 1996, the year she started on ER, she considered going home to Florida after her mother was diagnosed withovarian cancer (she died that year at 69). \"But my mom wanted me [to stay] and have that job. She was a fan of ER and knew much more about it than I did. When I got the part, I called to ask her, \"Who's Dr. Greene?\" This was what made her happy.\"\n\nShe would have been thrilled by her daughter's latest success. Thanks to CSI, Fox owns a three-bedroom Hollywood Hills home, where she lives with her boxer Ali and is, for now, single. She may have avoided the dating game by taking her brother to the Emmys last year, but there was no getting around the red carpet. \"I'm always the one with hair falling out, or I trip in my shoes,\" she says. \"That'll be with me my whole life.\"\n\n*Fox Rocks to Wake the Dead  \nAfter learning guitar at 14, Fox played in two New York bands in her 20s, \"but I always ended up owing someone money.\" Now that CSI pays the rent, she jams late into the night with friends- or on a soundstage with members of the CSI crew. \"When I act,\" says Fox, who also composes, \"I'm communicating other people's ideas. With my music, it's more my story.\" With a new chapter: She just bought herself a drum kit.*\n\n",

        "content": "\nThe star of TV's top show, CSI, on marriage allergies, getting frisked and bad smells in the lab.\n\n*1*\n\nPLAYBOY : When confronted with something gruesome, who is more likely to get queasy, you or your co-star Marg Helgenberger?\n\nFOX : Me, for sure. Marg is one of the strongest and toughest women I've ever met. Recently, while filming scenes for CSI, she has been in a meat market working with carcasses, walked through garbage at a disgusting landfill in Santa Clarita, California and worked in the pouring rain for days. She's a badass &#8212; she internalizes her disgust. When Marg, George Eads and I were at that landfill, Marg when into shock for an hour and barely said anything. We'd ask, \"Marg, are you OK?\" and she'd just not. George was trying not to get sick, and true to my Lower East Side New York City roots, I was screaming at the writers, \"You guys are fucking crazy! You fucking suck,\" for maybe 10 minutes. Because I'm the squeamish one, they think it's funny to put me on the grossest cases, which they do consistently. That episode about the high school cheerleader who gets upset and eats one of her classmates? That was my case.\n\n*2*\n\nPLAYBOY : Any pranksters on the show?\n\nFOX : We take turns. One of the crew members &#8212; who will remain nameless &#8212; brought in a remote-controlled farting device. I had a lot of fun with that. One day I was in every scene, and as a new actor would come to the set, I would use the machine. We got Billy Petersen while he was on camera. And I got Marg in rehearsal. But Marg has a 12-year-old son and she barely blinked. I thought it would get her so much better than it did. i acted like it was me who had passed gas and I just said \"Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.\" She got it. But I was meaner with Billy and acted like he was the one who'd passed gas. That fart machine entertained us for an entire afternoon.\n\n*3*\n\nPLAYBOY : Is craft service on CSI different from other shows?\n\nFOX : There are several of us who have a hard time eating at work. If we're doing something disgusting, I have to wait until it's over before I will touch food. A couple of months ago I was working with Eric Szamnda and we were going through a guy's stomach contents. It's season three and we're feeling cocky saying, \"This doesn't even bother me.\" We've got this vomit on the table and we're picking pieces out of it, trying to decide what the guy had eaten. Then we broke for a meal, which was pizza that night, and we both said, \"Oh yeah, let's have a slice. That sounds great.\" We went back to work and were on the set maybe 10 minutes before we were completely nauseated.\n\n*4*\n\nPLAYBOY : Has the show made you more life affirming or more cautious?\n\nFOX : Life affirming. it's left me believing that if it's your day, it's your day. I'm not stupid about my own safety, but I'd never want to be paranoid either. Death is very close to life. It's always hovering closer than we'd like to think. But it doesn't scare me.\n\n*5*\n\nPLAYBOY : What other franchises are in the works? CSI: The Hamptons?\n\nFOX : CSI: Hawaii would be lovely. The only one I've heard of that seems to have credence is CSI: London, which would be an interesting show.\n\n*6*\n\nPLAYBOY : What does it say about our society that we can't seem to get along without a lot of shows about crime and forensics?\n\nFOX : We live in a gray world right now, and some of that grayness is great, certainly where social and moral issues are concerned. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. That's what makes CSI so reassuring: It's nice to watch something and find out without a shadow of a doubt what happened. But the amount of violence in this country is horrible. Michael Moore, in Bowling for Columbine &#8212; one of the best movies I've seen in the past 20 years &#8212; asks why America has such a thirst for violence. There are several good theories: We are only a hundred years from being a hunter-gatherer society. It's in our genes and we act that way in our daily lives. I also think people don't have enough sex.\n\n*7*\n\nPLAYBOY : Would David Caruso be welcomed on CSI or would he and Bill Petersen out-earnest each other?\n\nFOX : I'd love it if David Caruso were to do a show or two with us. I think he and Billy would have a good time together, though I don't know if they'd do it. As far as I'm concerned, David is welcome anytime, especially if he works with the ladies.\n\n*8*\n\nPLAYBOY : Have you used any special investigative or forensic skills in your personal life?\n\nFOX : No. I prefer to use my intuition, which is wrong half the time. If I were to use too much information from the show, I would become Howard Hughes paranoid.\n\n*9*\n\nPLAYBOY : Have you ever asked for DNA samples from a date?\n\nFOX : No. I hope I wouldn't have to, but it's great that it's available. A lot of men finding out that they aren't, in fact, fathers, and it's a healthy thing for them to know one way or the other.\n\n10\n\nPLAYBOY : Are people creepier in real life or on television?\n\nFOX : I guess that depends on where you hang out. People are creepy in real life, but there is something much creepier about people who are seemingly normal but can act like serial killers. But I have to cme to their defense because I'm an actor. The schizophrenic positions that we put ourselves in for a living are pretty disturbing to an outside, but not to me.\n\n11\n\nPLAYBOY : Which star of a comedy show would you like to see as a victim on CSI?\n\nFOX : Larry David! I'd love to see him naked in the morgue. I've never met him, but I love his show. He's brilliant and funny, and it would be great to see him as a corpse.\n\n12\n\nPLAYBOY : If the cast of Friends is worth millions of dollars per episode and they just sit around ...\n\nFOX : There's certainly hope for actors everywhere that there's no ceiling on employment.\n\n13\n\nPLAYBOY : What's the worst-smelling thing in the lab?\n\nFOX : Burned human skin. Sometimes we wish the show were scratch-and-sniff, because we have to pretend that we're encountering bad smells all the time. Maybe that's for season four or five.\n\n14\n\nPLAYBOY : You go home after filming an episode that involves a particularly grisly crime. What do you do to fix yourself?\n\nFOX : Probably have a cold beer and a hot bath and I might have nightmares. Right now I really like Pilsner Urquell beer &#8212; a lot.\n\n15\n\nPLAYBOY : We understand you're allergic to marriage. What are the symptoms?\n\nFOX : Heart palpitations. And a feeling that I can't get enough oxygen. Cold sweats come with that. A burning desire to get into a fast car and drive quickly out of state. I have an inability to properly communicate, then the phone mysteriously breaks so I can't return calls. I hope to get over it someday, actually. I believe in true love and commitment and intimacy. That stuff is great. But, yes, I have this little problem.\n\n16\n\nPLAYBOY : Do you get out of paying for speeding tickets?\n\nFOX : Who says I speed? No, I would never do that. Maybe there are a couple of things I would try to get out of if caught. But for the most part, I would take responsibility. I'm not a huge speeder. I have a speed warning on my car. I set it at a certain speed and try not to go over it. But when I'm in the car and the music is up, I could look down and be 20, 25 miles over the limit.\n\n17\n\nPLAYBOY : For security reasons, have you been thoroughly frisked lately?\n\nFOX : Yeah, actually, I have. Isn't it a normal part of air travel these days? I took a flight with Gary Dourdan and George. We were flying first-class from Los Angeles to Vegas and had one-way tickets. We were stopped at every possible point along the way, probably six times. Our shoes were off, our pants were rolled up. My shirt was up to here, the guys' shirts were off. It was kind of fun to share that with two other people. I realize it was because of the one-way tickets. I support the airlines and the things they have to do to keep travel safe, but that one was a bit much &#8212; a threesome frisk. I saw parts of George and Gary that I hadn't noticed before. And that was comforting.\n\n18\n\nPLAYBOY : We understand you can play Stairway to Heaven on guitar. Do you do any other solo tributes?\n\nFOX : I have never been good at cover songs, mostly because it's so obvious that you can't play when you do them. If I make something up, I can fool people for a while. But the minute you offer up a song people know, they find out whether you're good or not. I can play a little bit of Van Morrison and Traffic, some Beatles stuff and a little Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I was madly in love with a boy in junior high who played guitar. I picked up the guitar because I thought it would be a way to hang out with him. When I stopped hanging out with him. I kept playing. I have a 1967 Rickenbacker hollow-body electric. It's beautiful. And I have a Yamaha acoustic, a brilliant guitar. It was a gift from some friends many years ago. Having a guitar that beautiful inspires me to get better.\n\n19\n\nPLAYBOY : Besides your name, what do you have alternative spellings for?\n\nFOX : My mom made up Jorja. I spent the first 10 years of my life convincing people that I knew how to spell my name. Everyone tried to tell me I couldn't spell. I'm not a good talker. I'm not very verbal, so I don't have alternative names for most things. I'm lucky if I can get something out that's more than two syllables. In English.\n\n20\n\nPLAYBOY : Has anyone made a charming play on your last name? And how did you reward it.\n\nFOX : Yes. I stayed for breakfast.\n\n",

        "content": "\nLead roles in ER and CSI have made Jorja Fox one of the most envied actresses in Hollywood.\n\nThere are three reasons why Jorja Fox particularly enjoys her job &#8212; and they all involve staring opposite Hollywood hunks. First there was George Clooney, then Rob Lowe and now there's Gary Dourdan. \"Believe me, there's no such thing as a bad day when you're going to work with those guys,\" she laughs.\n\nAfter playing Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, and Special Agent Gina Toscano in The West Wing, Jorja is now the ambitious forensic investigator Sara Sidle, in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. With the show knocking both Friends and ER off the ratings' top spot in America, it means that she has starred in three of the biggest US TV hits of the last decade. And most importantly, she's had gorgeous co-stars in all of them. CSI's Gary Dourdan, who plays Warrick Brown, was in a recent poll of the 50 sexiest men in the world.\n\n\"I know, I know, I'm a lucky girl,\" she grins. \"Gary is totally drop-dead gorgeous. Even now, two-and-a-half years into making the show, we'll be doing a scene and I'll look him in the eye and go to pieces. But,\" she shrugs, \"I've had crushes on most of the guys I've worked with.\"\n\nIt's disarming to hear an actress confess so freely &#8212; a Hollywood actress at that. But while Jorja, 34, may be a hot name, she's just one of the girls. and up for a good gossip. Forget bottled water, she swigs a beer and smokes a cigarette, her legs up on the sofa.\n\n\"Crushes\" on your co-stars?\n\n\"Oh yeah, I've had serious crushes on a couple,\" she says. \"And I've told them. But it's difficult to go for it if you're going to be working togeather for a long time.\"\n\nHer co-stars (even with their looks) would have a job pinning Jorja down anyway. \"I'm not keen on being settled,\" she admits. \"Even though I liked the idea of true love, I can't completely believe in the idea of being with the same person for my entire life.\"\n\nShe's also of two minds about having children. \"Theoretically, I'm maternal,\" she says. \"But not while I'm working the way I am. Anyway, they say 50 is the new 30. Our generation's taking a little longer to grow up.\"\n\nBorn in New York, Jorja moved with her parents, Edward and Marilyn, to Florida when she was three. She grew up in Melbourne Beach, surfing and going by the nickname of Foxy.\n\n\"I was a chubby kid with buckteeth &#8212; i could fit a quarter between my two front teeth,\" she smiles. \"Still, my mum went out and got Foxy Girl T-shirts for me to wear. I was not foxy at all.\"\n\nEven so, she was \"spotted\" at a model-search competition and spent her late teens on the catwalks of Europe. But determined to act, she worked in bars, as a waitress, in kennels and got TV bit parts until landing the role of Maggie Doyle in the third series of ER. She moved on to do The West Wing, starred in the film Memento with Guy Pearce, and then CSI came up.\n\nWith over 23 million American viewers, CSI is building an impressive fan base here too, and is the highest-rated drama on Five. Kings of cool Samuel L. Jackson, Quentin Tarintino and Kevin Spacey all reckon it's their favourite show. \"CSI feels special becuase I was in it from the start, when no one knew if it would take off.\"\n\nWith stories of decomposing corpses and bodies attacked by vultures, the subject matter is not for the squeamish. It's also hard for Jorja given that she lost her mum six years ago, aged 69, to ovarian cancer.\n\n\"Losing her and being in CSI has made me think there's a very thin veil between life and death,\" says Jorja. \"Maybe that's why I'm such an optimist. I don't worry about the future becuase it wastes the time you're in. I'd much rather be in the moment, enjoy each day, and do things that make me feel good. I've got a lot to be happy about.\"\n\n",

In 2002, the actor addressed senators in Utah and traveled to Washington, D.C., to fight a proposed storage facility for 44,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste on Goshute land. \"The hazardous materials will be transported on trains and trucks through highly populated areas,\" he said at a press conference at the Capitol. \"The storage land is on an earthquake fault line and subject to flooding.

MUMTAJ BEGUM dusts for prints and gets the inside story. \n\nNO one was more surprised than Jorja (pronounced Georgia, like the US state) Fox when the television series C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation took off the way it did. Embraced by both critics and viewers, it was the highest-rated new drama in 2000-2001 in the United States. Its second season has been consistently amongst the top three TV series in the US primetime ratings and it's also the No.1 show on all of US network television. \n\nFox, who plays the dedicated forensic investigator Sara Sidle, says: \"When it first started, we didn't know if anybody would want to watch a show about science and death.\" \n\nThe 35-year-old actress reckons it's because death is not a topic many people are comfortable talking about. And almost every week, somebody dies a violent death in C.S.I. \n\n\"Science is always a hard sell except maybe when it's a big Hollywood movie. But these subject matters on C.S.I. were something different from what was on TV when we first started. Also, the technology is happening right now, we have the ability to do things (in solving crimes) that we couldn't do years ago.\" \n\nC.S.I. revolves around a passionate team of forensic investigators that uses evidence at a crime scene to build up a solid case and ultimately to find the perpetrators. What's interesting about this show is that the team is made up of ethical professionals who never compromise their principles. This is especially striking since the Criminalistics Bureau is situated in Las Vegas, a city where corruption is not even a dirty word. \n\nAnother interesting element of the show are the special effects used in showing the details of a crime and the technology available in solving crimes. \n\n\"So much of the show we don't get to see. I only see my storyline; the special effects come in after. It's kind of fun for me to watch because there are a bunch of missing pieces that I don't get to see unless I watch the show.\" \n\nWatching the programme has also allowed the general public to become familiar with terms like buccal swab (a sampling of the cells lining the inside of a mouth to obtain DNA), luminol (a spray used to detect traces of blood) and purge fluid (liquids taken from a dead body). \n\nA recent report revealed that some people serving on juries in the US courts have a better perception of scientific evidence thanks to C.S.I. According to Fox, there is a good and bad outcome to this. \n\n\"Yes, juries are understanding better when a scientist explains evidence, but people are also going to the police and wondering why their cases can't be solved in six hours.\" \n\nThat was one of the discrepancies pointed out by real forensic investigative teams when C.S.I. made its debut ? cases cannot be solved as fast as implied on the show. While a fingerprint identification search takes only a matter of minutes on screen, in real life it could take days to find a close match. \n\nFox agrees: \"We try to make the show as slick as we can but sometimes we have to cheat. Some of the procedures that we do on the show take a lot longer (in reality). But we use real stories on the show ? stories taken from headlines. Writers spend a lot of time with current events. And if something touches their heart they will also try to tell that story. \n\n\"In life things are never black and white. They're usually grey. In our show it's very rare that something definitely happened or didn't.\" \n\nCrimes aside, there is very little information on the background of the characters. Once in a while, viewers are teased with tidbits like how Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) used to work as a dancer at a strip joint and how Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) once was a gambling addict. Nick Stokes (George Eads) is often frustrated at how slow his advancement at the department has been and of late there has been a certain spark between Sara Sidle and her boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen). \n\n\"Aah\" is Fox's reaction when asked what's up between Sidle and Grissom. \"What do you think it is?\" \n\n\"I think the tension between Grissom and Sara is going to continue for a while and it's going to have different phases. Basically, I think Sara does carry a torch for Grissom. But you have to ask what Bill (Petersen) thinks of Sara.\" \n\nThose who have been watching the new season on AXN would realise that the third season has a more personal touch. \n\n\"But not so personal because the show will always be a science show. Just a little history on the character, hopefully with some interesting personal twists and turns. I'm very excited to see what the writers are going to come up with because the pressure's on.\" \n\nSometimes too much success leads to too many spin-offs. There is the first spin-off C.S.I.: Miami and now there is talk of yet another spin-off set in New Orleans. \n\nForensic investigation has also become a fashionable job. But is it something that Fox can do? \n\n\"I could never do it. I have a tremendous amount of respect for them. The burnout rate is very, very high, of course. They do the job for five or 10 years and then they move on. There is a lot of violence in this country (United States). And when you see violence like that, it's very hard to stomach. It'll make me a very, very angry person.\" \n\nAn environmentalist and animal lover, Fox confesses she shares some similar traits with her character. Both of them are vegetarian (for non-violent reasons rather than for health reasons) and highly opinionated. \n\n\"We tend to focus on something very attentively before moving on to something else. I think I have a lot of endurance. I don't have very good social skills. Sara's impulsive. She's someone who really, really tries to do the right thing all the time. And I think I do that too. I try to do that. In some ways we are different. I can never do what she does. I think she's very courageous; she's much smarter and braver than I am.\" \n\nWhat is obvious is that Fox is very proud of being part of the show and working with its other actors. She even hopes to write an episode one day. \n\n\"The great thing about working on C.S.I. is all of us work very well together and trust each other's instincts. We are very focused when we work. It's very magical to me.\" \n\n'C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation' is aired every Wednesday, 9pm, on AXN with repeats on Thursday (noon), and Sunday (11am & 9pm).\n\n",

CSI is a procedural crime drama, first and foremost, and the worst thing that could happen is for it to become a workplace romantic drama (like NYPD Blue, which has lost much of its oomph and edge as its detectives keep partnering off with each other). Prediction: I wouldn't count on Catherine and Grissom ever making more than significant eye contact together. But CSI hasn't entirely been without a personal story here and there. Not long ago, Sara (Jorja Fox) learned her paramedic beau had a serious girlfriend after both were involved in an accident. I think this show is happiest when its main characters are at their loneliest. They live for their work, and that's why we watch. \n\n[...]\n\n",

Why would he tell Catherine if really he wants to be  \nwith Sara? It makes no sense, and they are just blowing the finale off like  \nit never happened. Everyone makes a big deal that Sara wiped chalk off  \nGil's cheek, yet Catherine hugs him, and not a word is said. I am just so  \nconfused. Can you maybe clarify what exactly the writers are trying to  \naccomplish? ? Janine\n\nMatt: From what little I know of the situation, the producers will admit to  \na sexual tension between Gil and Sara, and maybe even between Gil and  \nCatherine. But if this is why you're tuning in CSI, I think you're destined  \nto be disappointed no matter who you want Gil to lean on, hug, kiss,  \nwhatever. (My mail favors Gil and Catherine, no question about it. Very  \nlittle support for Gil and Sara.) But I'm all for CSI being all science, no  \nromance. A laboratory liaison on this show would be as disastrous a mistake  \nas showing Jack McCoy actually hitting on any of his lovely ADAs on Law &  \nOrder. I can understand why the writers would add little hints of  \non-the-job attraction in an otherwise just-the-facts show just to shake  \nthings up a little, but in this case it has become a real distraction for  \nCSI fans.

I think you were hasty in saying that a pairing  \nwould be disastrous. The show already deals with a tremendous amount of  \nnon-case driven material &mdash; just look at how Catherine Willows is  \nportrayed: single mother (as is mentioned almost every episode), former  \nstripper, has a murdered, violent ex-husband, her possible father may be a  \nkiller... I think you see my point. CSI would never become a soap,  \nbut a relationship between the two most interesting characters (in my  \nopinion), Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom, could flesh the characters out more  \n&mdash; when given, as Anthony Zuiker has said, in doses. I know I  \nwould love to see it, just as I also love the cases. To me, it is all about  \nbalance, and the show is not balanced right now. We know much more about  \nCatherine than any other character, and last season seemed too weighed down  \nby her melodramas. I would love to see more of the rest of the team,  \nespecially Sara Sidle. Jorja Fox is a wonderful, radiant actress who  \ndeserves more and better stories, as I think she is vastly underused.  \nThanks for letting me rant. I feel better now. &mdash; Michelle\n\nMatt:\n\nGlad to oblige. And I should say for the record that after the column  \nran noting I had heard more from Grissom-Catherine fans than from  \nGrissom-Sara fans, the other side weighed in. I was also informed that fan  \nsites and fan fictions also favor Grissom and Sara. So be it. I just watch  \nTV, and am rarely able to indulge detours into the deeper depths of online  \nfandom. I still think CSI would be wise parceling out these doses of  \nimplied romance in very small and cautious doses.\n\n[...]\n\n",

In fact, it's none of those &#8212; it's actually CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which has taken America by storm and is winning plenty of fans here too.\n\nReturning for a third season this week, it's a crime drama with a difference &#8212; with forensic science being the star of the show, rather than the actors.

Jackson are both huge fans and, since Five began showing CSI just over a year-and-a-half-ago, it has become the channel's highest-rated drama series, regularly pulling in two million viewers.\n\nThe series is produced by hard-hitting Hollywood veteran Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind films such as Armageddon. The new series opens with the team investigating a drag racer's death. If you're squeamish, be warned &#8212; they find the body after the vultures.

I didn't know if I would really be of sound mind, being in that world every day. I didn't know how death would affect me, or if it would get to me. In the first season in particular, I examined a lot of my own ideas about death, which I think was probably unavoidable. I realized that you either face it or are in denial. I'm glad I am facing it, although my ideas are still evolving and changing.\n\nHow do you relate to Sara?\n\n  \nShe is a renegade who has some problems relating to people on a social level. She is very, very good at what she does, but sometimes consumes herself almost entirely with her work. At the moment, she is also a little in love with a coworker who is very unresponsive to her ... but I won't give any more away on that front! It's a joy and a dream to play her, but I sometimes get confused playing somebody for so long. When I go shopping, buy an outfit and look at it a month later, I go, \"Who bought that? Sara or me?\"\n\nDo you think criminals are scared after watching CSI: Crime Scene Investigation?  \n  \nI hope so, but it's a bit of a double-edged sword. On some levels we probably give clues on how getting away, but then we show how difficult it is to get away with something. It's getting to the point where before long we'll be able to catch people doing almost anything.\n\n\"There has been some work done to raise money for crime labs across the country, and that's something,\" Jorja Fox says. \"But it would be great if we could encourage the government to spend more money on this stuff.

He hoped what he called a \"big misunderstanding\" with CBS and its chief, Leslie Moonves, will be resolved by the end of the week and he will be back to work on the hit drama.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely, I look forward to going back,\" he told a Television Critics Association meeting on Wednesday. He was on hand to publicize his upcoming TV movie Evel Knievel, airing July 30 on TNT.\n\nMeanwhile, Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, will for sure rejoin the show, says E! News Live. Fox was let go last Wednesday, it was said, because she had not met a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, to continue to report for work, ongoing contract hassles or no.\n\nThe actress was said to be \"mystified\" by her firing, because she believed she'd sent in her letter in time. E! said the Fox matter was ruled a misunderstanding, clearing the way for her return. \n\nShooting on the show's fifth season was to have begun last week, but cameras never got rolling.\n\n",

We all have to look out for the future of the network television business,\" he said.\n\nTranslation: \"You think we won't be able to find young hotties willing to wield cotton swabs and squint at carpet fibers for half the price?\"\n\nDeals with Fox and Eads were renegotiated after two years and a raise was offered for this fifth season although there was no contractual obligation to do so, he said. The actors reportedly wanted a raise in their $100,000-per-episode pay.\n\nDiscussions had been under way with their lawyers and there were certain \"veiled threats about their not showing up,\" Moonves said. They probably got the idea last year, when \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" star Brad Garrett successfully staged a salary walkout. Asked to compare the \"CSI\" actors' situation with that of the Emmy-winning Garrett, Moonves was vague.\n\n\"We did a negotiation, we brought him (Garrett) back into the fold,\" Moonves said. \"We're very happy we did.\"\n\nTranslation: \"He won an Emmy, for heaven's sake ... and he's big enough to stomp me into next week, so I signed the check.\"\n\nA call seeking comment from the actors (surprise!) was not immediately returned Sunday by their publicist.\n\nProduction will be halted this week while script revisions are made, Moonves said. The roles played by Fox and Eads haven't been recast but the network is \"looking at certain people,\" Moonves added.\n\nAnother cast member, Marg Helgenberger, reported to work as scheduled last week, he said. William Petersen, who co-stars and is a producer on the series, was on call for next week.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about damage to one of TV's top-rated series, Moonves said, \"Of course.\" Later, he said it was possible cast members Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle might play bigger roles.\n\n",

Just axed actors.\n\nGeorge Eads and Jorja Fox, who played two of the younger, hotter forensics experts you'll find poking around a corpse, have been whacked from TV's top-rated drama series, Daily Variety first reported on its Website Thursday.\n\nThe firings came after both Eads and Fox reportedly made it known to their bosses that, in the tradition of employees everywhere, they'd like to make more money.\n\nEads expressed his desire for a bigger paycheck by skipping the first day of shooting Thursday for CSI's fifth season, Variety said. (The Hollywood Reporter said he showed, but showed up late for the 6:15 a.m. call time.)\n\nFox, reportedly canned on Wednesday, drew the wrath of CBS execs for failing to, as Variety put it, \"reply to a letter asking her if she had any plans to not show up for work.\"\n\nThe trade paper said the network demanded in-writing assurances from all of its CSI actors-all of whom reportedly have been grumbling for more money-that they were going to be back at work as production began on the new season.\n\nFor all its efforts, the Hollywood Reporter said the network saw only Gary Dourdan, Warrick Brown on the series, report to work on Thursday, the same day the show earned four Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nVariety said CSI leads William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger were no-shows, albeit due to \"legit\" health-related reasons-and presumably not the same bug that bit the Everybody Raymond Loves cast last summer.\n\nFox was said to be \"mystified\" by her firing, sources told Variety. The actress apparently thought she'd met CBS' 5 p.m., Wednesday letter-sending deadline.\n\nIn the cases of Eads and Fox, CBS invoked breach of contract to justify the swinging of the ax.\n\nThe actors each had two years left on their TV standard seven-year contracts. Variety estimated they respectively were making about $100,000 an episode, and said that all the CSI supporting players recently had been offered small raises.\n\nNot pausing for a moment at their chalk outlines, Variety said the network has already begun searching for Eads' and Fox's replacements.\n\nIn a statement, Helgenberger called Eads and Fox friends and \"wonderful actors.\"\n\n\"I don't know the details of what is going on, but I hope that it all works itself out very quickly,\" Helgenberger said.\n\nEads, 36, played hair and fiber guy Nick Stokes on CSI. Like Fox, he had been with the show since its October 2000 debut.\n\nFox, 35, played material and elements point person Sara Sidle on the series.\n\nIf it sounds as CBS is trying to put the fear of God into its star employees, it may just be.\n\nLast summer, the network steamed as Everybody Loves Raymond costars Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle called in sick for a variety of ailments over the first 10 days of production. Brad Garrett just stayed away-period.\n\nThe cast's health, not to mention Garrett's attendance record, improved considerably once they were awarded raises.\n\nThe Eyeball, though, has not always been as amenable-particularly if the players aren't brand-name stars. It once threatened to gut the cast of Becker (Ted Danson, not included) if its actors didn't end a work stoppage.\n\nSometimes not even stars have been immune. In 1982, Dukes of Hazzard pin-ups John Schneider and Tom Wopat went to war over merchandising revenue. The Duke boys, Bo and Luke, subsequently were shown the highway, and replaced by two \"fake\" Dukes, Coy and Vance. (Schneider and Wopat returned the following season.)\n\nNone of Thursday's wrangling is likely to bolster the mood of CSI main man Petersen. The actor/producer has been griping for months about CBS' franchising of CSI, as evidenced in CSI: Miami and the upcoming CSI: New York.\n\nLast spring, Petersen warned that this coming TV year would be his last on the show, which averaged more than 25 million viewers each week.\n\n",

The past two days at Press Tour have been CBS, and everyone, including pres Les Moonves and EP Anthony Zucker, says they are fired, for good. Me sad. You?\n\nFrom larrypigtails: What the f-k is CBS thinking firing George and Jorja?\n\nThat has been the question at Press Tour. I have a very long quote from Les Moonves with his take on what happened, just for you. Here goes:\n\n\"I'm sort of old-fashioned. I believe when you and I shake hands and we sign a deal, it's a deal. A deal is a deal. And if by the fourth episode of the season, we had decided that George Eades, we wanted to fire him, guess what? I couldn't pick up a phone and say, &#8216;You know what, I want to fire you, but the contract really doesn't matter, so I'm not going to pay you for the other 18 episodes that I owe you.'\n\n\"We feel very important that it's time people realize that a contract is a contract. By the way, what hasn't been written is we renegotiated with these people after the second year of the show already once. What also has not been reported is we did offer them a raise, even though we didn't have to. When somebody doesn't show up for work, that says to us that, okay, they don't want to work for us anymore, and that's our attitude.\"\n\nHe also said the difference between G. & J.'s actions and the Brad Garrett thing last season is that they didn't show up to work \"at all,\" and he didn't appreciate their \"veiled threats.\" And more tidbits: \"We haven't recast CSI. We are looking at certain people, and we're talking to certain people about it.\" \"We are going to shut down production this week, and then we're going to start the following week..we're rewriting some scripts.\"\n\nFrom aver: *So, is it just that Dourdan, et al. weren't pushing for more money, à la the *Friends cast? **\n\nYes. And the problem is this, they aren't Monica and Chandler, and there was no Friends: NY, Friends: Miami and Friends: Vegas. Personally, I think these spinoffs simply showed Les Moonves that the shows can hold up on their own, regardless of any one or two actors. And rumor has it George and Jorja were making $100k an ep. An ep. I am on the wrong side of things here...\n\nFrom reddygirl: What can you tell us about Reiko's character? Is she replacing Jorja on *CSI*?\n\nNo. It's possible that Reiko could be recurring, but right now she is only signed on for one episode. She is not replacing Jorja Fox; this deal was already in place before the fallout-her character is a DNA person, so that Eric Szmanda's character can get out in the field.

News Live. \n\nFellow fired costar George Eads will stage a similar comeback-or so he hopes. Speaking to TV critics in Los Angeles Wednesday, Eads called his dismissal \"a big misunderstanding,\" the Associated Press reported. \n\nCBS had no comment Wednesday. \n\nFox and Eads were bumped off when CBS got out the Louisville Slugger and played hardball with the reputedly pay-hike-seeking actors. \n\nFox was let go last Wednesday, it was said, because she had not met a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, to continue to report for work, ongoing contract hassles or no. \n\nThe actress was said to be \"mystified\" by her firing, Variety said, because she believed she'd sent in her letter in time. \n\nE! News Live sources said the Fox matter was ruled a misunderstanding, clearing the way for her return. \n\nPer various reports, Eads was fired last Thursday after failing to show up for work, or failing to show up to work on time. \n\nWhile CBS interpreted his tardiness as a negotiating tactic, Eads said it was simply a matter of missed alarm. \n\n\"I overslept...I woke up white as a sheet three-and-a-half hours after I was supposed to be on the set,\" Eads said, per the Associated Press. \n\nThe actor, who played hair and fiber expert Nick Stokes on CSI for the past four seasons, said he has \"apologized nine ways to Sunday,\" but has yet to directly speak to tough-love CBS chieftain Leslie Moonves. \n\nOn Sunday, Moonves told TV critics he had no regrets about whacking Eads and Fox. \n\n\"There were certain veiled threats about their not showing up, and there comes a point where we all have to look out for the future of the network television business,\" Moonves said. \"This behavior has to stop.\" \n\nFor now, it's production on the Emmy-nominated CSI that has stopped-at least until its forensics team is in order. \n\nShooting on the show's fifth season was to have begun last week, but with all the spilled blood, cameras never got rolling. \n\nThe network formally began the search for Fox and Eads' replacements Tuesday, the New York Post reported, informing talent agencies it was seeking two actors-one male and one female-in their \"late 20s to mid 30s\" who projected \"sex, edgy and intelligent.\" \n\nFox and Eads each were earning $100,000 an episode, or $2.2 million for a TV year's worth of work.\n\n",

It's a right of passage, a game to play, in the struggle of actor contract negotiations. Just this year, the six principal voices of the Simpson's characters halted production demanding an increase in salary from $125,000 per episode to $360,000. \n\n[...]\n\nHowever last week, the balance of power shifted back to CBS and all the studios with the firing of actors George Eads and Jorja Fox who play play investigators Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle on the hit CBS crime drama CSI, as Les Moonves, CBS chief, called the duo's bluff. Fox and Eads were negotiating for a raise in their $100,000-per-episode pay. \n\n&#8216;There comes a point where we feel a contract is a contract. ... We all have to look out for the future of the network television business,' said Moonves. Differing from his 2003 policy of just telling the writers to rewrite the first episode of \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" to incorporate the absence of Garrett into the script, Moonves decided this time to eliminate the characters immediately by the two firings. \n\nWhen questioned about the concern he had in regards to the top-rated series, Moonves simply said \"Of course.\" It is speculated by Moonves that other cast members Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle could take over larger roles. However, there are attempts to recast the two castmembers as Moonves stated that although the characters portrayed by Eads and Fox had not been recast, CBS was \"looking at certain people.\" \n\nThe filming of CSI has been halted for a week while scripts are edited to reflect the casting changes. \n\n",

George Eads and Jorja Fox insist that they were fired over misunderstandings and weren't holding out for more money by Gary Susman \n\nGeorge Eads appeared at the Television Critics Association's summer conclave in Los Angeles on Wednesday to promote TNT's July 30 movie \"Evel Knievel,\" in which he stars as the famed daredevil, but Eads' biggest hurdle these days is getting his job back as detective Nick Stokes on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\" CBS fired him and costar Jorja Fox last week, claiming that they had missed work in order to hold out for pay raises. But Eads said Wednesday that a \"big misunderstanding\" was behind his firing, and that he hadn't staged a walkout but had merely overslept. Fox, too, has chalked up her firing to a misunderstanding and is reportedly negotiating with the network to get her job back.\n\nEads and Fox each had three years to go on their contracts, and each was reportedly earning $100,000 per episode (or about $2.2 million per year). Eads said that last Thursday, on the first day of filming the show's fall season, \"I woke up white as a sheet three and a half hours after I was supposed to be on the set and called to say I was on the way to work, and they said, &#8216;Don't bother.\"&#8216; The firings of Eads and Fox suggested that the networks would no longer tolerate cast walkouts as a negotiating tactic (one which had worked on such shows as CBS' \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and NBC's \"The West Wing\"), with CBS chief Les Moonves telling the TV critics' gathering on Sunday, \"A contract is a contract.\" On Wednesday, Eads agreed, using those same words, reiterating that his absence last week was not about money. \"I think I'm dealing with a man who's kind of cut from the same piece of leather I am,\" Eads said of Moonves. He added that he'd tried to apologize to the CBS chief \"nine ways to Sunday\" but had been unable to reach him to plead his case. \"It's kind of like meeting with Charlie of &#8216;Charlie's Angels,\"&#8216; the actor said.\n\nFox was fired last Wednesday, the day before she was to have resumed her role as sleuth Sara Sidle, because CBS said it did not receive a written pledge from her agreeing not to miss work as a negotiating ploy. According to Variety, Fox was mystified by her firing because she said she did sign the pledge; unfortunately, she mailed it instead of faxing it. Fox is now in talks with CBS to get her job back, sources close to the negotiations tell EW.com. When asked by EW.com on Wednesday about Eads' and Fox's job status, a CBS spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, supporting player Eric Szmanda, who plays lab-bound investigator Greg Sanders on the show, has quietly talked CBS into a raise, Variety reports. Not only that, but his character will finally get his oft-expressed wish to work out in the field. Just in case, Szmanda might consider keeping on hand a loud alarm clock and a fax machine.\n\n",

On Thursday, they're hoping lots of people will see their new show, \"Dear Bernard.\" It's an original musical the duo is presenting courtesy of Honeypot Prods., a grass-roots theater company they launched with a group of friends eight years ago. It's the biggest production yet and the first one to hit a real stage (the previous productions played to backyard audiences at the homes of generous friends, off-limits to agents, managers and attorneys). \"We're both a little scared, like will we be able to fill the entire place every night on the weekend for four weeks,\" \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" star Fox says over coffee with Reporter at Large and Reid on Larchmont Avenue. \"But there is a reason that it is our biggest show yet, because it's so great and a fun musical that has a lot of heart.\" Because of Fox's heavy shooting schedule with the hit CBS series, she's not taking a role in \"Dear Bernard,\" only producing along with Reid, John Switzer and Katherine Kendall. Starring duties go to Reid, who wrote the entire thing from dialogue to music, inspired by the experiences of her own mother. It centers on Chelsea Mills, an English import who arrives in New York in 1973 only to become one of the biggest body-part models in the big city. \"It is scary taking something like this that we've been working on for a long time and putting it out there,\" says Reid, who got used to stage life in her other career as rock goddess during her time in the Murmurs and Gush. \"We think it's good, but you never know what an audience will think. The cast is great, though, and we got a lot of people to come out on their own and volunteer their time to help get the show off the ground.\" And off the ground it gets beginning Friday and running through Aug. 7 at the Court Theatre.

Fox, who says she is \"still in shock\" from the professional push- pull, says the issue was not cash-related:\n\n\"I can say that it absolutely wasn't over money. But I can also say it is still something of a mystery to me. I mean, I don't act for money. That's not where I live, so to speak. I've done other things, had other jobs, where it was about money and putting a roof over my head and eating, but I don't put a price on my acting. Although naturally I think everybody's entitled to a raise when that time comes.\" (Fans know Jorja from the film \"Memento\" and from her original exposure in \"ER.\")\n\nSo why does she think she was fired? Fox, who emphasizes that she is \"elated\" to be back at work, replies carefully: \"Well, it was over this letter that we were all asked to sign about reporting to work, and I'd really never seen such a letter in my life - my professional life - and I think they didn't like my response ... I just don't think the punishment fit the &#8216;crime.' No threats were being made, nobody was asking for the sun, moon and stars ... and then, just as suddenly, CBS offered an olive branch. I really see this as a misunderstanding.\"\n\nIt is clear the actress doesn't want to get too specific (that first rock was a stunner) and her voice betrays considerable emotion and controlled indignation. It is humiliating to be fired, but she wants to put it behind her; there'll be no prolonged autopsy on this event. She adds with rueful amusement, \"I have no foresight. You know when I got &#8216;CSI,' I thought, &#8216;What a great show; nobody'll watch this!'\"\n\nStill and all, we had to ask: Did she get a raise? \"To CBS' credit, they did offer me more money. But I turned it down.\" Why? \"For one thing, George's head was still on the block - it would have looked like I was dancing on his misfortune. And, again, that's not what it was about.\"\n\nOn to happier subjects. Jorja's theater company,\n\nHoneypot Productions, has a well-reviewed musical running in L.A., \"Dear Bernard.\" She describes it with such enthusiasm, we suggest, \"Why don't you film it, put it on TV?\"\n\n\"That's an interesting idea,\" she says.\n\n\"Get CBS to do it. After all, if you didn't get a raise, you should get something.\"\n\nThe actress laughs, \"Oh, I don't know about that. Remember, they offered the olive branch. Not the whole tree!\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

You think, &#8216;This can't really be happening,' but it is.\"\n\nIn her first interview since the highly publicized souring of the actors' contract renegotiations, Fox tells us she feels she and Eads have been unfairly slammed by some of the media  and that much of what has been reported about the dispute and its resolution has been inaccurate.\n\n\"Seven of the eight cast members had put in for a raise  probably all eight did, but I can only confirm seven,\" she says. \"When you are lucky enough to be on a show that's a hit, you put in for a raise. That is commonly done ... There have been some very ugly contract renegotiations in Hollywood, but I didn't think this was going to be one of those by any means. I'm not one to make demands and hold out. That's not my style. I'm not a thug. It was kind of a bunch of strange events that lined up for this to happen.\"\n\nFox reveals that \"to CBS's credit,\" she was offered a raise, \"but I decided not to take it for two reasons. One, it would have said this was about the money, and it wasn't about the money. And two, George was out at that time, and we didn't know what was going to happen, and to achieve or acquire something on the event of someone else's firing just didn't feel right to me.\"\n\nThe actress refrains from getting into specifics, and \"I won't talk about George.\" She will say, \"It's definitely easier to be fired with a buddy, and it sounds terrible, but George is someone wonderful to be fired with.\"\n\nThey commiserated during their ouster and had a drink together once it was over. This week, she reports, six of the cast members are doing a scene together, and \"I'm sure the mood will be celebratory. We shut down for 10 days over this, and in that time, everyone in the cast and crew had a chance to think about how much we love doing this show. Coming back, it's been kind of like a renewal of vows.\"\n\n",

Many actors over the years have attempted to secure a pay raise by not showing up for work, as was the case for \"Everybody Loves Raymond's\" Brad Garrett last season.\n\nNo doubt expecting a similar situation, CBS had requested a letter from all of the show's actors confirming their intent to return to work. Both Fox and Eads were then terminated on Wednesday and Thursday respectively after the Eye didn't receive their letters. Both nevertheless insist theirs letters were sent and are mystified over their terminations. Co-stars Marg Helgenberger and William Petersen also failed to appear for work yesterday but each is said to be missing for legitimate health reasons.\n\nCo-stars Paul Guilfoyle and Gary Dourdan, both of whom are in the same pay range as Eads and Fox, were also said to be looking for raises however each is understood to have accepted modest pay bumps in exchange for more air time this season. Peterson and Helgenberger, who make significantly more than their co-stars, have apparently not made any rumblings about raises, making their absences likely nothing but coincidental. Helgenberger is believed to make $200,000 per episode while Peterson, who also has executive producing duties on the series, pulls down $500,000 per episode.\n\nEach of the show's principal cast members is in the fifth year of the industry standard seven-year contract.\n\nCasting is currently underway for actors to play new characters that will replace Fox and Eads' roles on the show.\n\nNo statements have been released from either camp however the news will undoubtedly be a key issue during today's CBS session of the TCA's summer press tour.\n\n",

        "content": "\nGeorge and Jorja are no longer on CBS exec Leslie Moonves' mind  \n\nWe can already picture the opening scene for the fifth-season premiere of CSI this fall. Lifeless prosthetic versions of George Eads and Jorja Fox will be laid out on the examining table in the morgue. Robert David Hall will shake his head as he writes down the cause of death: breach of contract. \n\nEads and Fox are the first victims in Viacom co-president Leslie Moonves&#8216; war on rising programming cost. Eads and Fox didn't report for work for start of production on CSI, so Moonves went Donald Trump on them last week. \n\n\"We offered them more money after Season 4,\" said Moonves at CBS's Sunday session at the Television Critics Assoc. press tour. \"And it wasn't enough. This behavior has to stop if the people in network television want to stay in business. The lawyers, agents and managers have to realize if we're going to be in business for a long time, things have to change. It's time that people realize that we can't be the whipping boy.\" \n\nThe agents for the two actors probably thought history was on their side. Last year, the supporting cast members of Everybody Loves Raymond staged sick-out until CBS agreed to renegotiate their deals for a bigger payday. \n\nBig mistake. Not all CBS stars are created equal. Raymond is a character-driven situation comedy. It has made a gazillion dollars for CBS in syndication, and keeping the tight-knit ensemble together on the show was worth it. Even as a loss leader for a season or two, Raymond had value as a lead-in into the network's new hit Two and a Half Men. \n\nCSI is a procedural drama that rarely follows the characters home after work. Just ask the many Law & Order actors who've gotten their walking papers from that show's producer Dick Wolf when their contracts were up. The cast members are cogs in the self-contained storytelling machines these shows and their spin-offs have become. \n\nMoonves pointed out that Eads and Fox, who had seven-year contracts with CSI, received raises after the show's first season. The increases offered for the fifth season apparently weren't enough. Eads' agents must think that Evel Knievel cable movie their client made is really good. \n\nMoonves declined to comment on whether he would take Eads and Fox in if they come crawling back. Reporters at the TCA seemed to take that as a sign that forgiveness is a possibility (The Biz is betting yes for Fox and no for Eads). But Moonves said the network has already started looking at other actors. Production will be shut down this week, he added, so that the first episode can be rewritten. \n\nBut this is also an opportunity for Moonves to make a larger point. While CBS's ratings are strong, the long-term outlook for the broadcast network television business is challenging at best. The slow but continuing loss of audience share to cable and the growth of digital video recorders that make expensive network TV commercials easier for viewers to skip will eventually take its toll on ad revenues. \n\n\"There comes a point where we all have to look out for the future of the network television business,\" Moonves said. \"It's no secret that four of the six television networks lost money last year &#151 we are one of the two that didn't. NBC is the other one.\" \n\nMoonves' hard-line approach could also be a byproduct of his new role at Viacom, which puts him in direct competition with former MTV Networks head Tom Freston for the chairman's job. Moonves is already known as a talent-friendly showman. Now he could be out to show he's a tough business operator as well.\n\n",

She played Lana, a Las Vegas stripper who served her jury duty with a heapin' helping of sass on the side. In fact, Ms. Buxton's resum&e reads like a laundry list of shady-lady roles &#8212; go-go girls, hookers, home-wreckers and other miscellaneous temptresses &#8212; in films, prime-time TV and daytime soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of our Lives. Tonight she returns to CSI (10 pm/ET on CBS) in a part that's very risqu&eacute;, even for her.\n\n\"I'm a transsexual murder victim,\" Buxton tells TV Guide Online with a naughty grin. \"A CSI director saw me in an L.A. play produced by [series regular] Jorja Fox and called with lots of compliments. He asked Jorja if I'd be offended if I were asked to play this part. She told him no, since it's an awesome role. And he wanted a real woman, since it's important to the plot that the victim be believable as a girl from the beginning. So I guess I'm supposed to be a successful surgery case!\"\n\nAn actress possessed of a more fragile ego might've been irked. Not Buxton. \"My voice is low and I have strong features,\" she says. \"It's funny, because this summer I got very close to getting a role as a transsexual in a movie. I guess I'm different looking. I never wanted to play boring girlfriend roles anyway.\"\n\nIndeed, Buxton never bores us. This year, the expert vamp added some much needed comic relief to Days&#8216; ill-conceived serial-killer story line. \"I was supposed to be there for four days and it ended up being three months,\" says Buxton, who played a blackmailing prostitute called Crystal Chablis. \"I couldn't believe a lot of the dirty things I said on daytime TV, which I personally would never say. I'd talk about making money on my back. Or I'd say, &#8216;Mmm... Tasty daddy,' about Drake Hogestyn&#8216;s character, John. I'd go on and on about how I wanted to take his tasty buns in the back of a limo. We laughed for weeks.\"\n\nBy the way, Crystal's currently MIA on Days. Was she written out when fans weren't looking? \"They never told me goodbye,\" Buxton says. \"The last thing I did was say, &#8216;I think I gotta get out of town. I'll talk to you later.' Drake had beaten me up, tied me up, and thrown water on me. He was really mean to me! But this week's CSI really takes the cake when it comes to me not being done right by a man, let me tell you.\"\n\n",

The rooster role, she says, will never be reprised. \"I dropped out of the play, actually,\" a giggling Fox told TV Guide in Los Angeles. \"I did a great rooster.\"\n\nFox has had guest roles in TV dramas The West Wing and ER and starred in 2000 film, Memento, with Guy Pearce. Her current popularity has been built on her penchant for microscopes, disposal gloves and tweezers while playing no-nonsense forensic investigator Sara Sidle in hit whodunit drama series CSI:Crime Scene Investigation. Still, staring in a top-rating drama is never something this actor takes for granted. \"We really have an appreciation for just how fantastically impossible this is, and to appreciate it every day,\" she says. \"I feel so deeply blesses. Who knows how long we'll be in this moment.\" Regular viewers will have tapped into the unresolved nature of the relationship between Sara and William Petersen's senior CSI, Grissom, who brought her to Vegas initially to watch his back and challenge her co-workers. \"Sara went into season four (currently on NINE) heartbroken and a little protective, a littler bitter and also quite fearless about certain things. \"I don't think she'll chase Grissom - and I don't think the dance between Grissom and Sara is over.

        "content": "[...]\n\nHowever, a more tangible problem that reality television has caused is a heavy increase in unemployment among actors and production crews. I was able to speak with two actresses, Jorja Fox of C.S.I. and Sami Reade an actress with 15 years of experience. They discussed how the changes have affected them and members of the acting and production community.\n\nJorja Fox explained how many actors, crew members, and writers have lost their jobs. \"Many reality shows for example can use non-union crews, eating away at jobs that have belonged to union members for a long time.\" Fox further described how many actors have had to take large pay cuts in order to keep their jobs.\n\nIt is easy to see how producers and network executives favor reality programming â low coast and large short term profits. But the long term might not look good. As Fox said, \"Reality shows do not repeat well, rarely go into syndication, and almost never show up in video stores.\"\n\n[...]\n\nSo what can be done from this point? Unfortunately, much of the control lies on the viewing public, but Fox has confidence that things will change. \"Storytelling has been around forever, it will never go away.\" Actors and crew members must also help the cause whether it is those who are employed and need to try and hold the line, or those not working who must take their careers in their own hands. \"Actors have been giving up too much of their power for years,\" expressed Fox.\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "She knows a swab from a cotton bud and a Glock from a... er... glockenspeil. Jorja Fox looks at the career of *CSI* Sara Sidle\n\nJORJA FOX took a huge gamble when she left the critically acclaimed West Wing to try out for the CSI pilot. Although she was fascinated by the script, the talented actress was convinced the fledgling series would get cancelled after only eight episodes. Fortunately, Fox's prediction was wrong, but looking back she wasn't even sure she had nailed the role of crime investigator Sara Sidle.\n\n\"I auditioned the first time and was still on crutches,\" recalls Fox. \"I had gotten run over on The West Wing. It was an accident, obviously. We were doing the season finale and we were doing this assassination on Martin Sheen's character, and during the shooting I was supposed to hit the ground on the street, and this limo ran over my leg. I was lucky I didn't break anything, but for my first CSI audition I was in flip-flops because I couldn't put shoes on and that was not going well for me. I had several auditions during the summer and I think the girl on crutches thing doesn't reassure people, but they kind of smiled and brought me back a second time.\"\n\nSara was officially introduced in the episode Cool Changes, when Gil Grissom brought her in from San Francisco to investigate a shooting. She may have initially ruffled some feathers but Sara quickly gained the attention and admiration of those around her, including Fox herself. \"I am still baffled by her intelligence,\" she states. \"That's a fantasy thing for me because she's so much smarter than I am. That's exciting and how authentic and natural it is. It is just something she was born with. And then there's the mystery surrounding her. That was never necessarily intentional but there's a whole bunch of stories there that we are just beginning to tell.\"\n\nThere's definitely been a formula to their crime-solving methods, so after almost five years of bizarre murders, kidnappings and accidents, how does a show like CSI keep things fresh? \"Umm... in very interesting ways,\" offers Fox. \"We've had such an interesting season this year with so many shake-ups. For the most part, I support them completely. I'm all for taking risks and breaking the mould. Whenever you take a big risk, you stand a chance of it being really successful or failing horribly. It is a courageous thing to do, especially for the writers. As the actors, we get the scripts and roll with it, but they take most of the pressure for doing new things or keeping it all the same. They are the ones in the hot seat.\"\n\nNowhere is that more evident than in the recent Mea Culpa, where head honcho Conrad Eckles split the CSI team into Swing and Graveyard shifts. Grissom remained in charge of Greg, Sara and newcomer Sophia Curtis, while Catherine was promoted to lead Nick and Warrick. \"I don't know yet,\" says Fox when asked about her thoughts on the division. \"I was opposed to it, but I've been opposed to a lot of smart things we've done, like moving us from Fridays to Thursdays. I thought we were going to get creamed. It is a good thing I am not calling the shots or I am not a network executive. We've also always had this thing with our show where half our audience would like to know more about the characters and half would really like us to stick to the science. It has been tricky for the writers because you are always letting someone down, so they decided to follow their hearts, which is the smartest thing to do. It is yet to be seen what fans think but it has been awesome for me to work with Eric Szmanda [Greg] so much. That has been fun, his whole arc of coming into the field and Sara playing a role in bringing him along. I had asked one of our writers last season, Josh Berman, that if he was going to put Greg in the field I would love to work with him, and they did.\"\n\nCertainly Greg and Sara have some smouldering chemistry happening, maybe a little too much considering she is supposed to be carrying a torch for Grissom. \"I tease Billy [William Petersen] all the time that I have a new boyfriend,\" laughs Fox. \"He's gracious about it but I also think he's not happy about it. In the second season, we sort of established Greg had a crush on Sara and of course I loved that. If people find her interesting, that is a nice feeling. Back then there was a feeling he was so young and there was a bit of an age gap. It's been interesting watching Eric because he has always been a beautiful man but he's coming into manhood in the character and Sara thinks that is attractive. I'm open to it and Sara has definitely been finding Greg sexier. And we have something coming up that is pretty hilarious where we find ourselves naked together and that's the only buzz I am going to give you on that.\"\n\nIt is never a dull moment in the crime lab, and during her tenure Sara has weathered her fair share of hard knocks, most notable in Bloodlines when she was picked up on a DUI. \"When we first started the show, I came in specifically as a love interest for Billy's character, Grissom,\" explains Fox. \"They told us we had this prior relationship, and as the show evolved that really changed. We either haven't addressed it or it's changed. The DUI was similar to that. There was no foreshadowing at all so I was really shocked and I don't think I really liked it right away, but then I likened it to the big old Pandora's box it might open. Right now, we're not going to play 'She has a drinking problem' but that she has some ghosts.\"\n\nThose spooks come back to haunt her in Nesting Dolls, as Sara confided in Grissom that her mother had murdered her father. If it seems like the writers are dumping on poor Sara all the time, Fox isn't complaining. \"That's a pro and a con,\" she offers. \"Sara has had a lot of personal arcs through the course of CSI, more than some characters on the show. In that way, I've been fortunate and blessed but it is scary to do it when the show is so process and story heavy and then they throw a curve ball at you. It is how I felt about Sara's mother killing her father. It was like a guinea pig situation with high melodrama. This could turn into something the audience really hates, so as much as I like taking risks, this was a scary risk to take. You can't go back from this.\"\n\nThose nerves were unwarranted. Viewers have always had a soft spot for Sara, which became even more apparent when they celebrated the character's September 16th birthday. \"Oh my gosh! How did you know that?\" exclaims Fox. \"I was completely surprised. It was really cool. It was a bunch of cards that were mailed to Carol Mendelsohn, who is our executive producer on the show. She passed them on to me. She was like, 'These came to me but they are definitely for you. You should check them out.' It was beautiful. Of course, I didn't even know it was Sara's birthday. We had made up stats up back in Season One: where are you from, where you went to college, your birthday, etc. I hadn't really though about it in a long time.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time Fox had received such an outpouring, either. \"The other thing is, when I got fired back in July, there was a tremendous amount of support from fans,\" she recalls. \"It wasn't stuff just coming to me directly but stuff going to CSI and CBS. I was completely blown away and it made me feel a lot better. It is a big deal.\" That rough patch Fox is referring to occurred last July, when she and CSI co-star George Eads were given their walking papers, supposedly over a pay hike dispute. Reportedly it was all a misunderstanding, but some wounds take longer to heal than others. \"I've never been fired from anything in my life, not even from a coat check job,\" she explains. \"I'm sure it's a rite of passage since everybody gets fired at least once in their lives, but in many ways I can't believe it still happened. I think our show is still trying to pick up the pieces from that. Business is business but it was a very difficult time.\"\n\nIf Fox holds any ill feelings, she is hiding it well. Quite frankly, speaking to the beautiful 36-year-old actress is more like having a friendly conversation than an interview. Alas, all good things must come to an end, so Fox concludes our time together by weighing in on whether being the number one show ever gets old. \"Oh yeah, sure,\" she deadpans. \"Never, ever, ever does it get tiring. It is mostly one of those things that it is not taken for granted but just a normal part of the television line-up. Every week I'm always shocked. A few weeks ago, we just won an SAG award and that was incredible. We were the top underdog and none of us thought we had a chance in hell. We were at the table for almost 30 seconds after they called our name. We were just looking at each other like, 'Did you hear what I heard?' We thought we had too much champagne or something. The ratings come back every week and I am always surprised.\"\n\n",

On one hand, there is Grissom, emotionally distant and much older, and on the other is Greg, the young guy who had a crush on Sara a while back.\n\n\"Haven't we all had crushes at work? Sara has always placed Grissom on a pedestal,\" reasons Mendelsohn. \"We found out this season that she didn't have a father figure because her mother murdered her father. So, it is very complicated, her relationship with Grissom. She's attracted to the unattainable man. Whether she will ever act on that is an open issue.\"\n\nPetersen sees the potential in a Gil Grissom-Sara Sidle relationship but feels Grissom is not prepared to jump into something so risky. \"I like that he's an enigma. It's the real reason why he hasn't kissed Sara yet, because he has to keep something back. But, I'd like to kiss her before the show ends,\" Petersen confesses.\n\nWhen it comes to the pairing of Greg and Sara, Fox does not dismiss the fact that it is possible for them to share something more than friendship, even though on-screen, Greg appears to have cooled his heels with Sara. \"I think Sara's heart is still sort of broken over Grissom,\" Fox voices. \"I know that Sara has been taking some second and third glances at Greg this year. He looks good in jumpsuits.\n\n\"Sara got lucky in Season Two. There was a second when Greg had a crush on her. She really enjoyed that. Back then, she thought he might be a little too young for her. But as time passes, people grow. And you are working such long hours together.\"\n\nTalk of relationships seems so implausible when it comes to the characters of the original CSI. Remember, this is CSI, a show that prides itself on concentrating on the \"whodunits\" (i.e. how a crime is committed and solved), and the likelihood of any romance taking centre stage is slim to none.\n\n\"If organically in a story two people reach out to each other, then you may see something,\" confirms Mendelsohn. \"It is not going to be a show about Catherine and Warrick taking a trip. (Anyway.) It was just a desire to keep the show evolving and exciting for our actors too. We are blessed with such a talented cast,\" she says.\n\nShankar concurs. \"After five years, you want to get a little bit more of a sense of the characters as people. You want to catch a little glimpse of someone's inner life in the context of the story or something that's going on. It is a good thing for the show in general.\"\n\n",

They will meet numerous leaders and dignitaries in politics, government, social reform, education, business and the arts, and take time to enjoy Morocco's architecture, art, music, folklore, and natural beauty. \n\nEchoing the goals of The Friendship Caravan, Jorja Fox told the caravan friendship that \"through this trip to Morocco, she hopes to encourage other people to visit and to be more understanding of cultures that are different than their own. She also hopes that they will be able to spread this message by laying the groundwork with the Friendship Caravan and Moroccan partners for an annual 'America-Morocco Friendship Conference of Women Innovators.'\"\n\n\"In this day and age, I believe it is of vital importance to find ways to transcend the stereotypes and misconceptions we might have of each other and to recognize how much we have in common. The importance of family, our love of nature and beauty, and most of all our desire for freedom and equality, are ideals we all share,\" Jorja Fox said.\n\nJorja Fox was born in New York City to French Canadian parents. She started a career in modeling, which took her to various places, including Milan. At eighteen, she decided to concentrate on acting, studying with veteran actor William Hickey at New York's Lee Strasberg Institute. She made her movie debut in the 1989 independent flick, The Kill-Off.\n\nHer film roles have included The Jerky Boys, Dead Funny, Alchemy, and the critically acclaimed Memento with Guy Pearce. Jorja is co-founder of the experimental theater group Honeypot Productions. She writes and stars in plays for the Los Angeles-based group. So far, she has written four of the group's five plays. The fourth play, Lovely Stanley, is a comedic romp about the women's bowling circuit. \n\nThe Friendship Caravan, Inc. is a not-for-profit American organization dedicated to promoting multi-cultural understanding and mutual respect through educational programs, discussions and media-friendly cultural events.\n\nThe Friendship Caravan's programs are non-political; they endeavor to reach out to and include all constituencies. In 2004 and 2005, they are focused, in particular, on the commonalities between Americans and people of the Kingdom of Morocco. \n\n",

True or false?\n\nJorja Fox: Both! In fact, I was fired. But they called me back within a week. I have to admit that it was a truly weird experience.\n\nTele Star: What really happened?\n\nJorja Fox: I wanted to renegotiate my contract and asked for an increase to my salary ($100,000). They didn't want to and showed me the door.\n\nTele Star: How do you explain your return to CSI?\n\nJorja Fox: It's thanks to the efforts of the other actors on the show and, especially, of the public, who reacted very negatively upon learning of my firing. Thus, I was back, but without an increase.\n\nTele Star: Did you always want to be an actor?\n\nJorja Fox: No. When I was 5, I liked doing little skits for my family, but nothing more. As a child, my great love was the sea. In fact, despite my atypical body shape eta: I think she's referring to her height, but I couldn't be sure; I don't think there's anything wrong with her body shape, I became a model. But I quickly understood, after several trips abroad, and in particular in Europe, that my career as a top model was very limited.\n\nTele Star: To come back to the show and to the character of Sara Sidle, do you have, like her, a scientific soul?\n\nJorja Fox: Not at all! Dissecting corpses, it's not really my cup of tea. I'm more of an artistic type.\n\nTele Star: What's going to happen to Sara in the next few episodes?\n\nJorja Fox: All I can tell you is that the writers keep promising to show a little bit of Sara's path. In the end,, they always seem to find a dark story for her.\n\nTele Star: And her love story with Grissom?\n\nJorja Fox: It's a story that never seems to end! But I think that, this year, we'll see them together a little.\n\nTele Star: To this effect, I've heard that you're allergic to marriagee\n\nJorja Fox: Just to think about it gives me heart palpitations.

Hostility heightened between the show's financiers (CBS and Toronto-based co-producer Alliance Atlantis) and its cast, half of whom got raises while the remainder did not, leaving more than a few bruised egos.\n\n\"I don't think the spinoffs hurt our show,\" said Fox, who didn't get a raise after the contract dispute and earns a reported $100,000 per show. \"But I think that they were certainly motivated by a certain level of greed.

        "content": "What a difference a year (not to mention a coffin, a crazed killer and hundreds of fire ants) has made for CSI.\n\nLast season was a rocky one, both behind and in front of the camera, whether it was one of the stars reportedly being fired and rehired after a contract spat or the show's investigative team suddenly splintering into two squads. Then along came the sizzling season finale, which reunited the teams in order to save a kidnapped Nick (George Eads), who faced certain death trapped in an insect-filled casket. But he survived, and his ordeal breathed new life into the series.\n\n\"We had a tough year last year. A real tough year,\" reflects Gary Dourdan, who plays somber yet sexy CSI Warrick Brown. \"We were just getting by, by the skin of our butts, to make it to the end of the year. The finale last season certainly gave us an uplift.\"\n\nThat Quentin Tarantino-directed ending has turned into a fresh start for TV's No.1 drama as it enters its sixth season, with the CSI detectives regrouping permanently into one team while struggling to cope with the emotional fallout from Nick's near-death experience. \"The ripple effects will continue,\" says executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.\n\nIt starts with Grissom (William Petersen) uncovering a clue that proves the criminal mastermind who kidnapped Nick has a partner who's still at large. \"Just when you thought it was over, it's just beginning,\" Mendelsohn says. \"What happened to Nick made them realize that life is short, sometimes shorter than they ever want to believe.\"\n\nAdds Eric Szmanda, who plays lab-guy-turned-CSI Greg Sanders: \"Now we're going to be more careful in how we approach everything. And we'll be more conscious of bugs.\" Particularly Nick, who doesn't have to wait long before the writers find a way to bug him: There's a scene early in the season where a big roach crawls on him, and he lets it creep up until it freaks him out.\n\nViewers &#8212; if not Nick's coworkers &#8212; will be let in on his real state of mind. \"What happened to Nick happened between him and the audience. The CSIs didn't see as much,\" Eads explains. \"I want to keep [his reaction] between me and the audience. If I get the shakes, I'll try to do it behind people's backs. I can say, 'I'll wait in the car,' and [the CSIs] will think, 'What does he mean? Is he waiting in the car thinking about what happened?'\"\n\nWhile Nick's trying to hide his reaction, Warrick stuns everyone with his very noticeable &#8212; and very personal &#8212; response to his buddy's abduction. By the luck of the draw, Warrick escaped being the kidnap victim, and that realization leaves him so rattled that he makes a move sure to change his relationship with his sultry supervisor, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger). \"They'll finally have that heart-to-heart a lot of fans have been waiting for,\" Mendelsohn promises. \"Catherine is thrown for a loop.\"\n\nDourdan admits he \"raised an eyebrow\" after hearing about this top-secret twist but says he's revved up about \"the dramatic changes taking place.\" Helgenberger though, seems a little less enthused because this could be the end of the characters' flirty friendship that, she says, Catherine \"hoped was going to be more than that.\"\n\nBut Catherine isn't just losing her potential love interest. Only a few months after being promoted, she's also ditching her gig as swing-shift commander to rejoin Grissom's gang. \"She can relax a little bit now,\" Helgenberger says. \"She's not having to watch her back as much. She will still carry the weight of a supervisor but not the responsibility.\"\n\nWill she and Grissom have a showdown about who is the boss? No one is talking. But Mendelsohn hints that Grissom's wish to get \"his guys back\" at the end of last season's finale will make him a different investigator now that his desire has been granted. \"To some extent, this is a season about Grissom feeling [things],\" she says. And his connection to his fellow CSIs \"is a lot deeper than he'd ever imagined when we first began.\"\n\nNot only will there be an episode in which viewers finally learn more about the cranky CSI's mysterious past, they may also get to see him open up in an unexpected way. A quadruple-murder case will take Grissom, Greg and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) out of Las Vegas. Holed up at a motel, Grissom finds Greg's snoring to be too much and ends up right where fans have wanted to see him &#8212; sleeping with Sara. \"They spend the night together,\" says Mendelsohn, grinning. \"What happens after that, we won't say.\"\n\nThis could be good news for Grissom but bad news for Greg. The youngest CSI's crush on Sara will cool down considerably. They'll continue to share a mutual discomfort around decomposing bodies. (\"I did a scene with Eric that people are saying is the grossest thing we've ever done,\" Fox says. \"It's a couple of bodies in the trunk of the car.\") But that's going to be it. \"He'll always be smitten with her,\" Szmanda says. \"But he has to scope out other options. I like to think by the end of the season, he'll have a love interest.\"\n\nThat is, if he survives to the end of the season. A two-part episode is coming in November, and producers are planning a surprise ending that could make Nick's desperate hours as bug bait seem like child's play.\n\n\"It will directly affect the future for one of our characters,\" promises Mendelsohn, who then pauses for dramatic effect. \"Nobody is going to get buried. Only, perhaps, professionally.\"\n\n",

        "content": "As CSI's Sara Sidle, she has her hands full of blood, bugs and rotting parts &#8212; but Fox's passion for acting gives her the stomach to cope, as she explains to Jenny.\n\n*O*ver the last five years, CSI has been responsible for some of TV's goriest scenes. From bone cracking autopsies to flesh piercing special effects and horrific murders, there.s no holding back when it comes to blood and guts. Yet star Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, admits that after five years the realistic looking bodies can still ruin her stomach.\n\n\"I'm especially queasy and weak and sensitive to it,\" she says. \"it's not just how gross and graphic it is, but it's the way in which it happened, that somebody horribly killed someone else. And God forbid we're doing a case that's based on a real story, that adds a whole other dimension to how bad I feel. It's like the violence of the crime is more repulsive to me than the graphicness of whatever we're showing. So it's not just peeling a face back in a coroner's office, far grosser to me is how the person got to be there.\"\n\nIf the blood isn't bad enough then there's always the bugs. When actors say never act with children or animals, no one mentions insects, but with the crucial clue of many of the show's cases being the bugs at the crime scene the cast have had to cope with plenty of creepy crawly encounters.\n\n\"We've lost the evidence a lot,\" says Fox. \"Bugs are tough, they're really hard to catch and you're trying not to hurt them at the same time. And they come with their own wrangler so there's no harming of insects on this show.\"\n\n*T*he 37 year old actress was already a familiar face on TV when CSI gave her a job. She'd had a recurring role as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, then she'd become one of President Bartlet's secret service bodyguards in The West Wing, while staring in the critically acclaimed movie, Memento. Fox had started off as a model after being talent spotted in a shopping mall near her Florida home, but her passion for acting and stature in the industry now means she can work with her own company, Honeypot Productions alongside CSI. \"I'm going to be finishing my ninth consecutive year on network television in the States and that's a really, really good run for anyone.\"\n\nBut that run almost came to an end at the start of the last season, as she faced unemployment after being temporarily sacked from CSI.\n\nAt first I though it was kind of a joke but then, after four or five days, I started to realize it was serious,\" she says. \"I think I probably feel a lot less safe about anything having to do with a show, and I think that's probably a good thing, I mean change is inevitable in life. But the rest of what happened was half of the cast was working with a pay raise, and half of the cast was not. I think that's not necessarily good for anybody on the show.\"\n\n*F*ox's character has faced a tough time on the show as Sara has battled booze alongside a king-sized crush on her boss Gil Grissom. They are some of the few scant insights that have been allowed into her character's personal life, but Fox believes part of the appeal of the show is based on the old fashioned idea of good against bad that's the foundation of the storylines.\n\n\"The CSIs go out there and really try and make peace and make truth using their minds and their hearts, you know. It's like an outlaw sort of gunslinger idea without the gun,\" she muses.\n\n\"I think we will go back to very story-driven CSIs at the start of the new season because all the characters, almost everybody on the show, went through something deeply personal and sort of painful last year. So we'll wipe that out for a while and probably do a lot of blowing things up and exciting chase scenes.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean the 'Will they - won't they?' romance between Sara and Grissom is off the agenda entirely. \"I think the ball is in Grissom's court at the moment,\" says Fox. \"I think that Sara's made a decision that she's gonna make. She chased him for about two seasons. I think there's definitely a possibility that something might happen between the two of them before it's all over. But she's so smart, she's so good at the job. But when it comes to matters of the heart, or of friends or personal life, she's completely awkward and uneducated.\"\n\nLike the other members of the original CSI cast, Fox admits she had reservations about the two spin-off series. With both Miami and New York competing for the viewers hears all the Las Vegas crew expressed doubts about the wisdom of created three rival CSIs. But Fox admits that, despite their fears, all the series seem to have found their own niche.\n\n\"I think if you offer somebody a really great piece of cake, they're going to take it. But then if they're offered cake every day, you might start to want ice cream. I may have wished, you know, that there weren't any spin-offs of CSI but I think that the shows have been able to sort of find their own legs.\"\n\n",

Daryl and Jorja, who are vegetarians, are LA's leading celebrity advocates for animals, and their support of Animal Acres is opening hearts and minds to the plight of turkeys and other farm animals.\n\nFrom noon to 4 p.m., guests will be able to enjoy tours of the sanctuary featuring three newly rescued baby pigs alongside the children's' favorite baby pig, Bagel. At 1:30 p.m. guests will gather to actually hand feed the turkeys. This will be followed by a delicious vegetarian thanksgiving meal created by LA restaurant Native Foods, one of LA's favorite vegetarian restaurants, served in the sanctuaries gorgeous courtyard.\n\nIn addition to nine rescued turkeys, the Animal Acres sanctuary is also home to 25 chickens that were victims of Hurricane Katrina and traveled from Louisiana to find safe haven. Other adorable residents include two calves rescued from a Southern California stockyard, and over 50 sheep recently seized from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse by humane officers.\n\nThe Animal Acres \"Feed A Turkey\" celebration hopes to teach people that farm animals are living sentient animals who deserve protection, and kindness, too. Most states specifically exclude farm animals from anti-cruelty laws. There are no federal laws to protect farm animals from abuse. As a result, farm animals in the United States are raised, transported and slaughtered in conditions considered so cruel they have been banned in other countries.\n\nThe sanctuary is directed by Lorri Bauston who co-founded the nation's first shelter for farm animals in 1986. Considered to be the pioneer of the farm animal sanctuary movement, Bauston has helped establish dozens of sanctuaries around the country and her efforts have been featured in several documentaries.

However, his scenes are significant, marking one of the rare occasions in which CSI goes home with a character to peel back layers of personality.\n\nIn the episode, Grissom visits the apartment of suspended subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) to ask why the abuse case triggered an outburst that endangered her job.\n\nCSI is at its best when solving crimes, Petersen says, \"not when people are crying.\" Yet he sees room to reveal personality through characters' reactions to crimes.\n\nScenes between Grissom and Sidle also stir up the complexities of a five-season relationship that has featured sometimes awkward flirtation and hints of deeper meaning.\n\n\"It's this weird sort of mysterious dance. We rarely know from one season to another how we're going to play the relationship,\" says Fox, whose character was first imagined as a love interest for Grissom.\n\nThe actors help influence the shaping of their characters, Fox says. \"One of the things I adore about Billy is that, coming from Chicago and that theater experience, he said, 'This is going to have to be a collective thing. We have to talk about things together.' \"\n\nAbout that raise...\n\nThe thought that CSI could have lost Fox and George Eads bothers Petersen. The pair, who were fired last summer during a salary dispute, eventually were rehired at their old pay.\n\nThe matter was resolved properly, says Petersen, who adds that the network \"would have been looking for me\" if the dismissals had stuck. \"You want a raise and that's wrong? When did that become wrong in this country? When did you have to get castigated for it?\"\n\nPetersen talked to Fox and Eads but didn't go to Moonves, saying it was their business. He trusts Tassler, who matched him with CSI creator Anthony Zuiker, but appears to group Moonves with many he says have changed with success. \"I'm good friends with Les when Les is a good guy.\"\n\nPetersen also disputes the notion that actors are interchangeable parts on procedural dramas.\n\n\"You can call it a procedural. You can say it's all about the science. If that were true, then these 30 million people would be watching the Discovery Channel. They're not,\" Petersen says. \"They want to see Marg (Helgenberger) and Billy. They want to see George and Jorja. They want to see Gary (Dourdan) and Eric (Szmanda).\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

Read a few more books. Do another Sunday crossword. Time to say goodbye to the people I love.\"\n\nAt that point, a figure crosses in front of Grissom, a hand touching his shoulder in passing. Grissom's eyes follow Sara as she sits down on the bed across from him, wrapped in a bathrobe, her hair still wet from the shower. There's no awkwardness between them. It's comfortable. Intimate. \"I'm not ready to say goodbye,\" she tells her lover.\n\nJorja Fox, who plays Sara, is curious, too. \"You know what? Honestly, Sara's never given up on Grissom, to be perfectly honest with you,\" she says. \"And that is the big question . how long has this been going on? You know, Hall and Oates do a great version of that song, and I think we're all wondering that same question.\"\n\nFans of the show have watched the sexual tension simmering between Grissom and Sara for a long time now.\n\n\"We were doling it out in little tiny pieces, just between me and Jorja, so it's a big deal for me and her, just in terms of where we're at,\" says Petersen. With this latest plot twist, he says, everything has changed and \"it's like a married couple in a bedroom at night talking to each other.\"\n\nThe clear implication, the actor says, \"is that we've had a relationship for many years that nobody knows about, that we, even in our behavior around here, nobody would know.\"\n\nGrissom might think so, but fellow super-sleuths Catherine (played by Marg Helgenberger) and Nick (George Eads) are far from clueless.\n\n\"I think that [Catherine] will be perfectly content just sort of watching it unfold and watching them trying to keep it a secret,\" says Helgenberger.\n\nNick's no fool either. \"He sees the way they look at each other,\" says Eads. \"He, I think, understands Sara very well. And I almost don't think he blames her. I mean, doesn't everyone just love Grissom? There's just something eccentric and weird and kooky and cool and awesome about Grissom, man!\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nSeveral Of The Actors Reflect On What Makes Them Tick\n\n(CBS) \"CSI\" is offering fans a lot more than the usual mix of felonies and forensics this season. \n\nThe hit CBS drama is also providing unique peeks at the inner workings of the minds of several of the characters. \n\nThe Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen took it even further when she spoke with several of the actors who portray those characters. She also asked about the season's final two episodes, both major cliffhangers. \n\n\"When you guys first started, six years ago, we knew nothing about (Gil) Grissom, or Catherine (Willows), or Warrick (Brown),\" Chen remarked. \"Now, we're finally getting to learn a little bit about what makes you tick.\" \n\n\"As much as one, as much as anybody knows what makes them tick, you know,\" agreed William Petersen, who plays Grissom. \"... I mean, uh, if you ask Grissom, he, he doesn't know, exactly.\" \n\nAlso this season, the ticking time bomb of attraction continued between Grissom and Sara, Chen observed. \n\n\"It's almost like we all have these alter egos, you know,\" observed Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle. \"That started back in season one. And now that it's been six years, I totally do. I have hopes for her and dreams for her, and I get upset for her.\" \n\n\"You're more Sara than Jorja,\" Chen observed. \n\n\"Yeah, yeah, no, it's confusing sometimes,\" Fox responded. \"Certain times of the year, I'll buy a piece of wardrobe and I'll look at it in the summer and I'll be like, &#8216;Who bought that? Who did... Oh, right, Sara must have bought that!'\" she laughed. \"You know, it's a strange thing that you go in and out of.\" \n\nLast season ended with Nick Stokes, portrayed by George Eads, buried alive &#8212; and this season appeared to follow in that dark tradition, Chen said. There was a murder scene that echoed the Holocaust, another episode in which a woman was sealed alive inside a chimney, and the team even investigated a mass suicide. \n\n\"I think the word has come down on the Internet,\" said Gary Dourdan, who plays Warrick Brown. \"I think they've been getting feedback, that's what people like. They like watching the train wreck. They like watching the car accident. They like watching the dark stuff. We can show things on our show, on network television, the bloodiest stuff. \n\n\"But we can't have a sex scene,\" he adds with a laugh. \"I don't understand it!\" \n\nIn Thursday night's episode, a Las Vegas casino becomes a maze of chases and deceptions after only one man survives the brutal killing of his wife and co-workers. \n\nDourdan told Chen with a chuckle that the soundstage t is so realistic, \"When you walk on the set, it's, you're, you're in a casino. (laugh) They had to walk around and tell the extras, &#8216;Don't put money in the slot machines! You won't get it back! They do not work!' \" \n\nChen notes the actors couldn't be happier that \"CSI\" is heading into its final two episodes with two cliffhangers on tap, even though it's not something \"CSI\" usually does. \n\n\"The more you kind of just to not make it, uh, to not get in a rut, you know, to give it some life and to give it some change,\" said Eads, \"we have such a talented cast here that to play emotion is something we all kind of are, our chops are kind of dripping to play.\" \n\nAdded Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows, \"I guess season seven, I'm hoping, anyway, seven and eight, will be really, you know, just a continuation of that and be lots of arcs of various characters and intermingling, and, and just so it just, I think it makes it more, uh, textured and more rich.\" \n\n\"CSI\" is riding high in the ratings as it heads into season seven ... something the cast members didn't dare imagine when they took their first case. \n\nSaid Peterson, \"You don't ever put that into the, the ethos, that somehow or another, you're gonna be around for seven years. You know, you just hope to make a good show today. It's a big crap shoot, and we happened to roll the right dice. I guess.\" ",

        "content": "\n**Jorja Fox  \nPlays Sara Sidle**\n\n\"I am upstaged all the time by pieces of carpet fibre!\"\n\nJorja Fox is probably best known for her TV work - she had a starring role on ER as Dr Maggie Doyle and a recurring part on The West Wing as Agent Gina Toscano. On film, she can be found in smaller films such as Dead Funny, Velocity Trap and appears as Catherine Shelby in Memento. CSI's Sara Sidle is a recovering alcoholic who has appeared since the very first show. A dedicated, driven forensic scientist, she nevertheless finds her personal life occasionally affecting her professional career.\n\nYou seem to enjoy playing Sara...  \n  \nI love that I'm playing someone who's worlds smarter than I am and that is always a good reason to get out of bed: \"I went to Harvard and Berkeley and studied physics, nuclear fission...\" But there are times where it's not so easy! I was on a roof scene this week for about three hours. They didn't put me on the roof, I was on a set that they built that was about four feet off the ground but I still had to wear a harness, which felt really silly because I'm an adult, so there are days where it's really hard work. But, how cool is it that I get paid to do that? It never ceases to amaze me.\n\nDo you feel like the show is more about the crime than the people sometimes?  \n  \nI am upstaged all the time by pieces of carpet fibre! They'll spend two hours lighting carpet fibre and ten minutes lighting us. I think it's really great, though, because I our hope is that people who like the show will always want to know more about the characters and you reveal it a little bit like snapshots. So I would much rather do that every week than a show where you're just purging constantly. I think the longevity and mystery of it, I think there's still a lot of mystery around a lot of the characters and I'd like to believe that that at least partly keeps people tuning in.\n\nDo you enjoy the character work?  \n  \nI think we all get really excited and also it's kind of scary, especially if you're going some place that the show hasn't gone so much before. I felt I've been really lucky in that way, I've got to be the guinea pig a couple of times. So it's amazing and fun and terrifying and I'm always just crossing my fingers and hoping that it works. It's been really nice to see a lot of the other characters do that this year and it also makes Sara a little less crazy. Everybody else is having breakdowns!\n\nIs it true you were holding out for more money at the start of Season Five, or was that just rumours?  \n  \nI wasn't holding out for more money, I merely wanted a raise (laughs). I, who had been spoiled enough to come from ER and West Wing before I came to this show, had only really known that as an example of how things worked, so it's a very normal thing in the television business that if a show is doing really well that every two years, many of the cast, including the crew and other people, will go in and ask for a raise. Anything can happen from that, and I'm sure you've seen some really dramatic stuff on TV where people really hold out for it, in this case nothing like that happened - they invited George and I not to come to work, and then they changed their minds.\n\nHere comes the science bit...CSI is loaded with technological terms that the cast have to trip off their tongues at speed every week. How do you handle it?  \n  \nI don't like to read the scripts too late in the day, they give me the creeps. I used do it a lot before bed because I like to read them straight through and that's the time of the day that it's quiet and the phone stops ringing, but it's also the time that, I've had nightmares many times!\n\n",

And I think the writers did something bold and brilliant by trying to just really follow their hearts, which is what I think we try to do.\n\n\"When you've got a split that is that significant, all you can really do is to kind of just tell what you feel passionate about and hope that people go on the road with you,\" she added. \"But it is really exciting, yeah, and scary, because then you step out into these story lines and you're like what if they go badly?\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nModest to a fault, Jorja Fox is gracious about what many would call the burden of fame and relentless scrutiny by the public that comes when starring on TV's top rated show. CBS's \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\"\n\n\"In general, I'm only surprised that people want to hear what I have to say at all, about anything,\" she laughs. \"I'm always, you want to interview me? OK. Sure!\"\n\nBut Fox doesn't want to talk about her fabulous television career, doesn't want to pose for the cameras in yet another glamorous photo shoot. This isn't to be mistaken for the classic TV star brattitude of \"It's so hard to be me- where's my Perrier?\" Rather, Jorja Fox has more pressing issues on her mind. She's interested in equality for all, women's right to abortion, Hollywood's allergy to age, and the Bush Administration.\n\n\"I celebrated the death of the United States of America a couple of months ago,\" Fox announces, grabbing a beer and settling in to discuss George W. Bush's State of the Union address.\n\n\"I'm very proud to be an American Patriot, and I'm a capitalist, but I feel that the constitution I grew up with is pretty much null and void.\"\n\nFox numbers her reasons for why Bush should be impeached. The Patriot Act is number 16.\n\n\"They stole the election,\" she says. \"Twice. There's a couple more reasons.\"\n\nThe war in Iraq and the mishandling of Hurricane Katrina come in at the top of the list.\n\nOn the issue of equal rights for women and gays, Fox continues to be forthright.\n\n\"You know, here we are in 2006 where we supposedly have equal rights and [women] are still making a third less than most of the men in the country. And that's fucked.\"\n\nFox then refers to Pastor Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, who has a website called godhatesfags.com. Phelps and his supporters parade around the country to cheer at the funerals of gay people.\n\n\"It's an absolute disgrace,\" says Fox.\n\nAs for the issue of abortion, Fox is struck by the view of the Religious Right that an unborn fetus has the same rights as, if not more than, every American Citizen, especially women and homosexuals.\n\n\"They're saying to us that a little clump of cells has the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but not human beings that are alive and well and living on the planet.\" She pauses to take a puff on her cigarette. \"I take issue with that.\"\n\nHollywood is also on her radar.\n\n\"A woman reaches her 30s and 40s, and the odds of her working, not even necessarily as a star of a film, but just as a bread and butter job- the odds start to decline rather rapidly,\" notes Fox. \"It's one of the uglier truths of this town.\"\n\nA self-described \"rock and roll chick,\" Fox wonders what's supposed to happen to women like herself, not to mention heroes like Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, and Melissa Etheridge.\n\n\"Am I just going to grow into my sixties in my ripped-up blue jeans and my boots, or is there another way that I'm supposed to look?\" Laughing now, Fox flashes her trade mark gap-toothed grin. \"Cause left to my own devices, I'm going to look like Keith Richards.\" Which isn't to say that Fox is headed the nearest plastic surgeon's office.\n\n\"I never saw myself as someone that would want to be involved in this intense, losing, race against time,\" She reflects for a moment. \"It just seems really futile and painful and deprived\" She smiles. \"And I like my lines, I've earned them.\"\n\nPutting aside revolution for a moment, Fox allows herself to be cajoled back into discussing her career and the fact that she has weathered the many storms of rabid media interest regarding everything from being fired and then rehired by \"CSI\" in the summer of 2004 during contract renegotiations to rumors that she's pregnant.\n\n\"There's a point in the year when it's been raining a lot in L.A. and it's not that easy to work out, and the Heineken six-pack starts to show up around the belly,\" She chuckles as she takes a sip of her drink.\n\nFox takes high notes regarding the fiasco of 2004, and skirts the subject disgracefully, instead of focusing on gratitude for her success of television.\n\n\"It's like I'm in Vegas and I'm at a slot machine and I'm stuck to it, like my hands are really stuck to the slot machine, and I've just been hitting it consecutively, for six years.\"\n\nFox relates to all her characters, from Dr. Maggie Doyle on \"ER,\" to Agent Gina Toscano on \"The West Wing,\" to Sara Sidle on \"\"CSI.\" In spite of similarities between the three characters, Fox isn't worried about typecasting.\n\n\"They're all gun-toting, really cerebral, over-educated women,\" she says, \"I feel like if I'm going to be typecast, then wow, thank God.\"\n\nAccording to Fox, developing a split personality when inhabiting the skin of another person is par for the course, even when the cameras are turned off and the crew goes home.\n\n\"It's not like [the characters] caught a plane to Greece and married some guy or died,\" observes Fox. \"In some strange way they sort of still hang out there somewhere.\"\n\nShe cites playing Sara Sidle as her \"greatest joy,\" and say she and the rest of the cast were stunned by CSI's breakthrough success.\n\n\"I really thought of the show would fail miserably after eight episodes,\" She laughs. \"I thought nobody would want to watch a show about death on a Friday night.\"\n\nCurrently in pre-production for an original musical called \"Dear Bernard.\" Fox and her theater company, Honeypot Productions, are readying to take their play to London's famed West End, which is a huge step for the grassroots crew. The group, made up of old New York acting buddies going back to 15 years, has traditionally put up small shows in people's backyards with free booze because Fox feels \"...shows go better when alcohol is involved.\"\n\nAs for the revolution, Fox hasn't given up. As the bumper sticker puts it, she thinks Christian Right is neither. She feels the group is powerful simply because it doesn't play by the rules of decency that the Left continues to honor.\n\n\"I'm not a professional activist by any means. I'm just and actor. But it seems to me we need that next thing.\" She muses.\n\nFox believes that the fight is far from over, and claims she's not going anywhere until she's done her part to reclaim what she describes as the America she grew up in.\n\n\"Dreams come true all the time,\" she smiles, stubbing out her cigarette. \"You never know when, but they do.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox has seen her character Sara Sidle go through a lot over the five and a half years \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" has been on the air, but the 6th season has been less tumultuous for Sara, even allowing her to help Nick Stokes (George Eads) as he grapples with the fallout from his ordeal in Grave Danger. Fox took the time to sit down with CSI Files to discuss the reunited CSI team, her complicated reactions to the team split in the previous season and Sara's relationships with the other characters on the show.\n\nCSI Files: Sara had quite a traumatic year last season. What do you think the fallout will be from that?\n\nJorja Fox: One thing that's been really wonderful for me this season is that it's the first year that I haven't come into the season with some sort of impending disaster or something really heavy going on in Sara's personal life. So it's been nice to sit back a little bit and sort of pass the torch to George and also to Paul Guilfoyle (Jim Brass), who did \"A Bullet Runs Through It\" (Parts One and Two) and Louise Lombard (Sofia Curtis)-they had a very rollercoaster, emotional event in their lives happen. I don't think any of those stories are over and done. I do think the writers have left me with something of a reprieve for a little while. And it's been kind of nice! I had at least one episode with George where Sara got to be the person on the sidelines. She could relate to what [Nick] had gone through, though it's not exactly her own experience, but she could be there for him and watch him come to terms with his own trauma. That was a really nice arc for me to get to play for Sara, instead of being in the middle of all the tragedy, to be the person on the sidelines, saying it's going to be okay. That was really, really fun. But yeah that stuff [about Sara's past] will be back for sure. There's a lot of cool stuff, especially about Sara's mom. It's out there in the ether somewhere and we'll see when the writers decide to bring it into the show.\n\nCSI Files: Are you enjoying playing Sara as being someone to lean on as opposed to needing to lean on others?\n\nFox: Absolutely. I think interestingly enough Sara's incapable of leaning on anybody. It happened very early in the series-there were actually one or two moments where she was able to lean on Nick Stokes. So it was kind of cool that when this came back for him, she got to be somebody that was standing there. And though the character of Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) has saved her butt a couple of times, the character of Nick Stokes has been that guy to check in and be like, \"Hey, are you okay?\" I think Sara's definitely been an island for most of the length of the series. It's really nice feeling I came into season six and I still am [an island]. I'm always looking for moments in the script where at least my character can be a little lighter and have a little bit more of a smile. I think that those two episodes in season five, they were very cathartic for the character in the sense that there was some stuff she got to move through. And although there're elements of that that probably still haunt her, I think that she does feel a little bit more empowered and a little freer from her past than she had for the length of the show.\n\nIt was getting close to painting her into a corner of no return I think. I'm always so excited to play these things, and they're always a surprise. Either you hear a few days before the script comes out or you hear when the script comes out-you're just reading and you're like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm going to be in a mental institution! What? And my mom was there?\" It's scary to play that stuff. It's so fun because it's like, \"oh, surprise!\" but the truth is there's always a part of me that hopes the audience actually can take this journey with this character. I hope it's not something that's just going to put my character in a place where less people end up relating to her than before. Between the drunk driving thing and chasing Grissom for over a year and a half and the lab almost blowing up on her, she's had a lot of stuff [happen to her]! So it's almost like, \"Whew! Thank God the audience is still with me.\" It's a sigh of relief that people aren't like, \"Oh, Sara's crazy! I don't like her anymore.\"\n\nCSI Files: Sara is more popular than ever! She has a lot of fans at TalkCSI, if you've ever seen the site.\n\nFox: I have checked it from time to time. I haven't checked it in a while but I do. I think the last time I wanted to check it about George's mustache actually. But I didn't get to unfortunately.\n\nCSI Files: Unfortunately, it wasn't very popular!\n\nFox: Oh, that's too bad! I think on a day-to-day basis-the writers especially-we gotta just try and follow our hearts. If we're too overly obsessed about whether people are going to like something or whether the fans are following it, then you can get really caught up in that. You can get into a cycle where somebody's always not going to like something and then you get scared to take any risks or chances. It's funny because the show breathes, it begins and it ends with the fans. And we've been so very lucky to have so many. But it's always a dangerous [thing] which is why I don't check CSI Files too much because you get nervous that people aren't happy and you get this crazy downward cycle, like \"Oh no, I've let down the fans!\" It's like way worse than letting down the writers or one of your co-stars.\n\nI thought [George's] mustache was really flattering. I'm from New York and Florida, so I feel I've got this urban person and also this very southern, rural person that co-exist, they make up who I am. George is from Texas. When he showed up with the mustache-which I thought looked really great on him-I think it's that Florida part of me. I'm thinking, well, shoot, 85% of the country really wears mustaches. Look at Colorado and Texas and Vermont and Tennessee and Arkansas-we've got a lot of fans in those areas, so I think I was a little more optimistic about it than some folks.\n\nCSI Files: I didn't realize what a big deal the mustache was until I saw the fan reaction on our site!\n\nFox: Who knew, right? That's why I haven't changed anything in six years! It works really well for the character-I feel like she's the type of woman that probably stays the same a lot. It is a whole other Pandora's box. Like, \"Well, maybe I'll go blonde!\" People will care about that stuff. It's a surprise to me that folks are as invested as they are in that.\n\nCSI Files: It surprised me that it was such a focal point in the midst of the \"A Bullet Runs Through It\" episodes, given that they were such powerful episodes.\n\nFox: Those two episodes are my favorite two episodes ever of \"CSI\". When I read them on the page, I was like, wow, if we can do half the job that the writers did on this episode, this really could become the \"CSI\" opus of the whole six years. I just thought they were so beautiful.\n\nCSI Files: The revelation that Brass was the one who has mistakenly shot the officer was so powerful and unexpected.\n\nFox: It worked. I think very few people got ahead of that and said, \"Oh, it's got to be Brass.\" Very few people saw it coming.\n\nCSI Files: There was an interesting scene between Sara and Sofia in that episode, and the conflict between them seems to be an ongoing one. What do you make of the conflict between the two?\n\nFox: That might end up ultimately being a question for the writers because they kind of want to play it, and then they don't play it. We've shot a couple of scenes that they ended up cutting out. I personally would rather not play it at all. Very early in the beginning of the show, Marg [Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows] and I fought. There was a little bit of a desire in the beginning that Marg and I would go head to head [more] than we have. Being the only two women on the show, we didn't want to set up that relationship for us. It was a place that neither one of us wanted to go, and we were able to beat that one. Certainly, Catherine and Sara do go head to head, but it's not really a through line of their relationship, which I'm really happy about. I definitely feel the same way about the character of Sofia Curtis. I'm still not completely sure how the writers want it played, but I know that I don't want for Sara to be angry at some random woman because the guy that she's in love with doesn't love her back. I think she's too smart for that, even if just intellectually, to blame someone else for the fact that she's not getting what she wants.\n\nIt was a beautiful scene [between Sara, Sofia and Grissom]. I thought Louise played that scene just brilliantly and I really tried to put the energy into that scene that [Sara's issue with Sofia] was really just about that case. Certainly I think there were a lot of folks that read other stuff into it, so it will be interesting to see what happens with them. I think it's awesome to have another [woman] around. When we started there were six of us in the beginning, and then very quickly it became eight and then there was talk of becoming ten like we are now. We haven't added a woman to the cast until then, and again, there are only two of us, so I was always like, \"Yeah, let's get another woman on the show. That would be really cool.\" Now we're seven guys and three women, so there's still room for another woman, I think.\n\nCSI Files: Louise Lombard is definitely a great addition to the cast.\n\nFox: She really is. And I was really jealous when she became a detective! I was like, \"Wait a minute! Nobody told me they were thinking of making one of us a detective.\" I thought it could be really fun to switch gears like that, even though for me personally the interrogation scenes were some of my least favorite on the show. I thought, how amazing to be on a show for a while and then to completely switch hats. It's a challenge for her, and I think it's going to be a really fun thing. She was surprised herself!\n\nCSI Files: Why are interrogation scenes your least favorites?\n\n*Fox: * I think it has more to do with the character [than me personally]. I think that because all of us that are CSIs are scientists-we're not cops. We work for the police and we're a branch of the government, but technically we're not police officers. So I think there was always for me, from season one, an awkwardness of how a scientist goes into an interrogation situation. I still feel after all this time that I haven't completely found my way in that room. There's a part of me that still feels a little uncomfortable. That's where when you get to play a character for such a long time, you really do start to feel like you have a split personality. Like, is it Sara that doesn't like interrogations because she feels uncomfortable or is it me, Jorja? Lines get so blurred after a certain period, but I think it did start with Sara. I think that because as a character, social skills are not her best, it's not her strongest suit, and there's often sort of an awkwardness or sort of a strange detachment [in the situation]. I think being in the interrogation room and confrontational and presiding as a police officer is uncomfortable for her. She would rather chase the science than look somebody in the eye and try to read whether they're telling the truth or not.\n\nCSI Files: That social awkwardness is something she and Gil Grissom|Grissom (William Petersen) have in common.\n\nFox: That's a true line that they share very closely actually.\n\nCSI Files: We had heard there was supposed to be a scene in a hotel room between Sara and Grissom early in the season in \"Gum Drops\", but that it was cut for personal reasons.\n\nFox: Billy had a family emergency that took him home to Chicago for the length of that episode. So, yes, as a matter of fact there was [a scene that was cut]. We were going to kick off the season with a bigger Sara/Grissom milieu than we'd ever done, with a little less ambiguity.\n\nCSI Files: Do you think the relationship between Sara and Grissom will be explored further this season, and if so, where would you like to see it go?\n\nFox: I'd asked the producers about a year ago for a new boyfriend, and had brought it up a few more times. Sara's been lucky enough that she's had first of all this affinity for Grissom, and then there was a boyfriend, the paramedic, that she had for almost a whole season, and then there were a couple of guys in the lab that had had crushes on her, so I thought it might be through line for her. So I had said [to the writers], \"You don't have to put it in the storyline or anything, but it could be even an off-comment that someone makes, that Sara's got a new boyfriend.\" So far they haven't done that, so it leads me to believe that they do have plans somewhere along the way for Sara and Grissom or something that's newer that's come up, that's even more recent to me, Sara and Greg, which has been tossed around a little bit. I think the last time Grissom said no, that Sara decided that that would be it, that she wasn't going to chase him anymore, and indeed if there was anything ever to happen between them, he would have to reopen the door. So the ball's definitely in his court. I do think the producers have plans.\n\nThe whole Sara and Grissom storyline originally would have kicked off with a bang [in \"Gum Drops\"], but unfortunately Billy had a loss in his family so that story's been on hold since that time. George stepped in beautifully on very, very short notice and they changed the story slightly obviously. We didn't do the scene where George and I would be in the hotel room together instead of her and Grissom. But we got to play some very beautiful stuff with his character coming off of \"Grave Danger\" from the end of last year. Sarah Goldfinger wrote that episode (\"Gum Drops\")-she threw all her heart into it and it was very disappointing for her that episode wasn't going to be what she thought she had wrote, and she stepped in and made something equally as beautiful.\n\nCSI Files: What do you think of the idea of the paring of Sara and Greg Sanders|Greg (Eric Szmanda)?\n\nFox: That one was a surprise to me! One of the greatest things that happened to me in season five was that I got to work so intimately with Eric Szmanda. We're very good friends after last year and had hung out socially a lot from the beginning of the show, but I feel like I know Greg Sanders so well now. Every day was fun and an honor and a privilege. It was fun to be the teacher for a change. I think Sara having been partnered up with Grissom for so long, she could play chess with him head to head, but at the same time she's unequivocally the student. So it was really awesome to be able to turn around and be the teacher for a year. I really enjoyed it.\n\nI never thought there were really sparks between [Sara and Greg], and a couple of papers got a hold of it and started playing it and then Eric did an interview this summer where he was asked if there would be anything between Greg and Sara and he stated for the record that they would be just friends, that Greg had had a crush on her but that he wasn't interested in her anymore and they were better off as friends. And I yelled at him, \"I can't believe you broke up with me in the paper!\" First of all, I didn't even know we were going out, and then you have this horribly public break-up. I was the last to know! It's a big question mark. Every major storyline that I've ever had in this show has been a surprise to me. I never knew it was coming, not even two or three months ahead of time, so I could plan for it. I do think that anything is possible, but I think that there's a slimmer chance for Greg and Sara than there is for Grissom and Sara, especially since Billy hasn't publicly broken up with me in the paper! \n\nI miss working with Eric. We get the odd scene together, but we really haven't worked together the way we did last year. I was lucky enough to [work exclusively] with Billy [early on in the show]. Billy had scenes with a lot of other people, but it seemed that for seasons one and two, mostly when I worked, I worked with him. He was my primary scene partner. There's definitely a chemistry that you get to build when you work with somebody like that, whether it's platonically or not, the way when you work with anybody intimately, even in your real life. You start to get into a rhythm and a flow that's really fun and totally different. I might have had one or two scenes with George and Gary in all of season five and I missed them. So I'll look at the schedule and say, \"I'm going to see Gary today, we're going to work together, this is going to be fun.\" So that's been really nice. But, I don't think any of the intimacy is built up as well when they're switching scene partners all the time. It's really fun and cool, but you don't get to go to the deep levels that you do when you're with somebody in the trenches for long periods of time.\n\nCSI Files: How did you feel about the team split in season five?\n\nFox: I wasn't a fan of it. It almost felt slightly scary. I didn't think the storylines would suffer all that much. Season five started so dramatically off-set as well as on-set, and there were so many strange events coming into the first few weeks of season five. It culminated with George and I appearing to have been fired-there was a lot going on. At that time, for them to split the team up, for me there was sort of this conspiratorial, they're trying to split us up so we can't provide support for each other, which we always really been very good at giving. Billy has championed that as the guy that brought all of these actors together. There's always been a really amazing safety net-we stuck together authentically, and we care for each other. When we were suddenly split apart, it felt like they took the show and threw it on its axis, and it spun differently. There were some great stories that came out of it, and in a way it turned out to be this beautiful blessing and it gave the writers something very different to do, which I think they were ready to do. We got Louise Lombard introduced out of the whole thing. Looking back on it, it was a very cool thing, but at the time, it was like, \"What's going on here?\"\n\nCSI Files: Were you happy when the decision to bring the team back together was made?\n\nFox: I was thrilled about it. I think it's proved to be an amazing thing for the stories. As an actor, I miss seeing stories through to the end, which is something we did so intensely in season five because we were split up. So if you got a case, you were pretty much on it, you saw it from the crime scene all the way to getting the guy or girl, or the guy gets away. This year, I'm doing a lot more acting where I'm a piece of the puzzle that gets solved, so I like the stories better thematically, but them sometimes as an actor I wish that I had those cases again, that was the coolest part about being split up, really getting to see something through.\n\nEverybody got a lot of strong emotional arcs, even if they were completely linked to the story: you'd be in interrogation with the person, you'd catch them on the street, you'd meet the mother or you'd meet the victims' families. And now that job falls in the hand of three or four different characters. I think the scripts this year are maybe my favorite year of stories. In a short amount of time, we've told some really interesting, offbeat [stories]. The structure's been slightly different, the writers have been taking some risks and just [producing] some really cool stories, like the cult episode that Danny Cannon wrote and directed (Shooting Stars).\n\nCSI Files: It seems like there are more stories with one case being central to the episode, as opposed to two or three.\n\nFox: Yes, and I think that has everything to do with the team being back together. In order to show the team working together, the line of one case really plays to that. You can see the power of this team, so I love what it says about us.\n\nCSI Files: Are there any episodes coming up that are significant for Sara, or any that you can preview?\n\nFox: I've got one right in front of me here, Jerry Stahl's first episode of the year and it's called Pirates of the Third Reich. I haven't read it yet, but I know that Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) is coming back, which is really cool. I watched people read it last week and watched the color fall from their faces. It's definitely a very dark, scary script. People have read it and had nightmares about it, so I'm getting ready to read that. I don't want to read it too late in the day!\n\nWe just went to Vegas. Billy and I have been paired up a little more in the last couple of months than we were in the beginning of the season, so the two of us will be solving cases, which is fun.\n\nCSI Files: Any sexual tension between Sara and Grissom?\n\nFox: Not so much tension, but certainly the rebuilding of the foundation of intimacy. It's possible [the writers] are laying the groundwork.\n\nCSI Files: What aspect of Sara's personality do you most enjoy playing?\n\nFox: Sara is my favorite character I've ever played. It's a joy every single week to get to go to work and be that person. My favorite thing about her is how smart she is. She studied at Berkeley and Harvard, things that I could never even dream of doing, and that's just awesome to get to pretend that I'm that smart! I love her focus. I love that she can sit with something for hours and hours. I still feel like there's a pretty healthy sense of mystery around her after six years. It's a testament to the writers that there are still some secrets and some parts of her and puzzles of her own that people would like to know more about.\n\nCSI Files: I know people are very interested to see if her background is going to be explored further.\n\nFox: And that's a story that I would love to tell, so we'll see. I do think that there's more to come on that story.\n\nCSI Files: Do you have a favorite role outside of \"CSI\"?\n\nFox: I would say \"The West Wing\", Gina Toscano (a Secret Service agent). I've gotten to play some really smart women on TV, and some women that are outside the box. Maggie Doyle (on \"ER\") was cool, too-she was a gun-toting, vegetarian lesbian doctor-what a great role! I think the role of Gina [is my favorite] because when I started on \"West Wing\", Aaron Sorkin, who was writing the show at that time, said to me, \"This woman is one of two hundred thousand highly trained people in the entire world.\" The specialized training that she'd undergone and the education she'd had was very, very specific. Similar to \"CSI\", it was a role we hadn't seen all that much. We've seen it a couple of times with men in feature films, but to bring that identity to television-we don't know a lot about these people on purpose-to try to bring somebody like her to life-and how cool that she's a woman-made it even rarer. It's a make-believe world, but the stories that Aaron Sorkin was telling on \"West Wing\" were stories that I found absolutely fascinating and timely and I was so glad that somebody was getting to say the things that he was saying on television at the time. So I felt like I was a part of something really important. It was really an honor for me to do that.\n\nCSI Files: Do you enjoy the science on \"CSI\"? Do you have a favorite case that you found enlightening or shocking?\n\nFox: I love the science. My favorite stuff is the lab stuff because I just indulge on getting to play a scientist. It's really fun. My other favorite thing to do on the show is crime scene. They're still, after six years, just as haunting and eerie as they were in season one. That's a surprise to me, that they haven't become old hat. Unfortunately, because a lot of the stories we tell are based on true stories, it really adds a level of gravity to what we're doing. There's just something otherworldly about the crime scenes. Even though they kind of freak me out, I love being there. When you're working, it's rare to get a chill, even when you're doing a horror movie. There's something about the style we shoot them in, the actors that we hire and the stories that we tell that get to me. And that's an exciting feeling.\n\nIn terms of a favorite case, that would be really hard. For season one, it's Too Tough to Die. We had a technical advisor, Liz Devine, and it was the first script she wrote for the show. She is now one of the executive producers for \"CSI: Miami\" and she writes weekly for TV, but this was her first script, and it was a real story of hers, [based on] a case that she worked on when she was a younger CSI. A lot of tech advisors have that one case that even five, six, seven years later still haunts them, or it becomes the case that represents the whole reason of why they do what they do. For her, it was that story, \"Too Tough to Die,\" and I was lucky enough to play her in that scenario. It was awful to do it, but it was also cathartic. [Devine told] the story with so much emotion and focus, that [it led to her] writing a whole bunch of other scripts. She was with our show for a couple of years, and then six months or a year into \"Miami\", Ann Donahue stole her. I was so sad to see both of those women go. They wrote some of my favorite stories and wrote a lot of stuff for Marg and I to do. But I was also so happy for them and I'm thrilled for them that \"Miami\" has done as well as it has.\n\nCSI Files: I've heard it said before that the \"CSI\" spin-offs have taken a lot of resources-writers and crew-from the original. Do you agree with that assessment?\n\nFox: There's no denying it. There's a list of folks that have left our show for \"Miami\" and \"New York\". What's amazing for our show is that if you had our head art department guy leave to go to Miami, the guy that was working under him for the most part took the job. So we had a lot of junior people, writers and crew, who were able to move up on our show. It was a very benevolent situation for people personally. 70% of the original crew for our show is still in tact. What's happened is that people have just continued to move up. I was joking with Marg that we have a list of producers on our show that's grown to thirty-five, and half of them were writers' assistants in season one! I was joking with her that we should have a credit called the &#8216;Co-Cos.' It would be cool to have a credit because it seems so many people have credits before the show!\n\nI do think whenever you're lucky enough to uncover a diamond in the field, you want to hold onto it, and on a certain level you feel like it's yours. The hardest part about spinning off so many shows that deal with forensics is that it happened so quickly, so fast and so early. Our show was still just getting its wings when it was getting dissected and amputated. It was a horrible feeling. I still feel like the luckiest person on the planet, but at the time I felt like I was so lucky to be a part of something, and then watching it get dissolved in front of your eyes was painful to watch.\n\nWhen I was on \"ER\" during the glory days, seasons three, four and five, \"ER\" did not split itself off. It stayed intact and it was averaging 45 million viewers a week. Even though \"CSI\" has been the number one show in the world for the last couple of years, we've never garnered the viewers that \"ER\" used to regularly garner when it was number one and that is one of those questions. If we had stayed the only show, would we maybe have been able to see that or eclipse that kind of thing. Not that that's the end all, be all, but there's no ceiling on anything and I like to test that all the time, to see how high you can fly. And if you can't fly high, it feels a lot better when you couldn't fly because you couldn't do it, not because you felt like something outside yourself affected your velocity.\n\nThe upside of that is that it's built a lot of careers for people that really deserved a shot and got a shot-wardrobe folks and writers and directors that started with us and were able to branch out. They got the wings.\n\nCSI Files: What do you attribute \"CSI's\" enduring popularity to?\n\nFox: I think we all really wish we knew the answer to that question! I think it's a pretty intangible question to answer. One thing I think we've been able to provide: The show went on the air in 2000, and by January of 2001 there was this very ambiguous, mysterious election in America, and I think a lot of people are still not sure that they got all the facts about what went down. Oddly enough, on Thursday night, that unequivocally, without a shadow of a doubt, provides the truth about things. And I think right now that's a comforting thing for people. It's pretty rare right now. It's something we can provide.\n\nEither that, or the world's just way overly obsessed with death! This macabre fascination with maybe even violence over death.\n\nCSI Files: I think part of it is also the curiosity of human nature, a fascination with people who can be so evil as to commit murder.\n\nFox: It's so frightening what a lot of motives turn out to be. Are these people crazy or really mean? I've got to think these guys are crazy, that no sane individual would be capable of doing something so cruel and so merciless for a really random reason. I'm lucky enough not to have known too many people like that personally-I just meet them in the realm of make-believe.\n\nI feel like there's a climate right now where people have very, very strong opinions and if they meet somebody who disagrees them, we behave really aggressively when that happens. Instead of being able to just disagree with somebody, we've got a climate going on globally where people who don't see eye to eye are killing each other over it on a daily basis. It's human nature and it's been going on since the beginning of time, but even with America being so split on so many issues and feeling so angry about that split, there's just this really strange climate happening. And that's just one of the things about \"A Bullet Runs Through It\" that I thought was so beautiful and brave and timely.\n\nCSI Files: It seems like that kind of thing pervades every level of society, and the scariest thing about that is that as soon as we stop listening to each other, we have no chance to find any common ground.\n\nFox: When did we ever start thinking that we all have to think the exact same thing about everything? We'll see if somebody can turn that around. \n\n",

But it doesn't take a professional to figure out who the perpetrator is behind the deaths of the billions of animals killed for food every year &#8212; namely, the meat industry. That's why Jorja &#8212; a longtime vegetarian &#8212; jumped at the chance to shoot a provocative new pro-vegetarian ad for her friends at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn the ad, Jorja stands over a police chalk outline of a cow surrounded by crime-scene tape next to the tagline \"Baka Kinain, Baka Kinatay. Kinain Mo Ba Ito? Investigate Vegetarianism.\"\n\nWhile shooting the ad, Jorja took the time to explain that the more she learned about how animals are killed for food, the less she wanted to be a part of it.\n\n\"I was having a meatball sub one day in Brooklyn [New York], and it just clicked,\" says Jorja. \"I was in the middle of that sandwich, and I put it down, and I never had meat again.\"\n\nWhy do Jorja and PETA think that eating meat is a crime? On today's animal factories, animals are crammed by the thousands into filthy windowless sheds, wire cages, gestation crates and other confinement systems. These animals will never raise their families, root in the soil, build nests or do anything that is natural to them. Cows, caives, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and other animals are kept in small cages, in jam-packed sheds or on filthy feedlots, often with so little space that they can't even turn around or lie down comfortably. They are pumped full of antibiotics, hormones, and steroids in order to grow so fast that many become crippled under their own weight and die within inches of water and food.\n\nPeople who eat animals also suffer. Consumption of meat and other animal products has been conclusively linked with heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers &#8212; all among leading killers in the Philippines &#8212; as well as arthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, asthma and impotence. Scientists have also found that vegetarians have stronger immune systems than meat-eaters and are less susceptible to everyday illnesses like the flu. Vegetarians and vegans live, on average, six to 10 years longer than meat-eaters.\n\nFor more information, visit PETA's Web site GoVeg.com.\n\n",

        "content": "\nIf the revelation that Sara (Jorja Fox) and Gil (William Petersen) are having an affair came as a surprise to \"CSI\" fans in May's season finale, it was a surprise that was a long time coming. And not just because there have been little hints along the way.\n\nJorja Fox said that when she auditioned for the role of Sara, the \"tiny little character description ... suggested that she was a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom.\"\n\nAnd the idea of bringing them together has been kicked around, debated and fought about for six seasons.\n\n\"There have been raging debates in the writers' room since season one about Sara's relationship with Grissom pre-Las Vegas &#8212; what actually happened in San Francisco,\" said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. \"And the room is fairly divided and has been over the seasons. I happen to think that they were intimate in San Francisco, but not intimate once they got to Las Vegas, at least in the beginning.\n\n\"And since I'm the show runner, I won the debate.\"\n\nThere has also been some debate among fans as to whether or not this is a good thing.\n\n\"There's been about 50 percent of the audience who would like to know more about the characters and about 50 percent who would really rather stick to the stories,\" Fox said. \"And I think the writers did something bold and brilliant by trying to just really follow their hearts, which is what I think we try to do.\"\n\nMendelsohn said she's been told the split on the Sara-Gil romance has been about 60 percent for, 40 percent against.\n\n\"And I don't know whether it was just my assistant putting all the pro letters on my desk,\" she said. \"But I read letters from students at Harvard, science teachers, viewers from Italy. And across the board, the fans wrote it was such a pleasure to see two adults, two professionals who are so good at their jobs have found each other and are now engaged in an intimate and mature relationship that's not salacious.\n\n\"You didn't see them ripping off each other's clothes.\"\n\n\"That's this season,\" Fox interjected with a laugh. \"Billy (Petersen) and I have been working out all summer.\"\n\nThe fact that fans are reacting as strongly as they are is a good sign either way, the thinking goes.\n\n\"When you've got a split that is that significant, all you can really do is to kind of just tell what you feel passionate about and hope that people go on the road with you,\" Fox said. \"But it is really exciting, yeah, and scary, because then you step out into these storylines and you're like &#8212; what if they go badly? There is an element of safety sometimes with sticking with the hair fibers and the flies.\"\n\nThe feeling among the writers and producers seems to be that the time had come to play the Gil-Sara romance card.\n\n\"Six seasons into the show, it was a very organic and I think a well-deserved end to the season for the fans,\" said executive producer Naren Shankar. \"And we hinted at it toward the end of this last season.\"\n\n\"I was very intrigued and I had sort of been gearing up from the beginning of the show that might happen,\" Fox said. \"We suddenly find these characters together, and we know not how long has this been going on. And I think that was a really brilliant way to do it. I think it's going to open a lot of ideas for the characters.\"\n\nBut, apparently, the relationship between Sara and Gil won't become fodder for office gossip. At least not any time soon.\n\n\"In this one instance, the viewers will be ahead of our CSIs,\" Mendelsohn said. \"So the viewers will be in on it. The CSIs will not know.\"\n\n[...]\n\nThe good news is that, in addition to a seemingly endless supply of gruesome murders to investigate, \"CSI\" still has a lot of territory to cover in the regular characters' personal lives.\n\n\"I think one of the greatest gifts of being on this show is that we're starting our seventh year, and there's still so many intimate stories that we could tell about these characters,\" Fox said. \"I think it's pretty rare for a show to be on for seven seasons and hopefully you still want to know more about the people than you do.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

Two years ago, CBS fired and then rehired Fox after she initially refused to sign a return-to-work agreement.\n\nHere's what the 38-year-old New York native had to say about \"CSI\" and other topics in Pasadena, Calif., this summer:\n\nOn Sara and Gil hooking up: \"Sara was originally a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom. So being that it was on there (the original script), I was very intrigued and sort of thought it might happen. I think one of the coolest things about it and the way that the story ended up being delivered at the end of season six, is to suddenly find these characters together, and we know how long it's been going on. I think it's brilliant.\"\n\nOn \"CSI's\" creative process: \"You know, you just get this little description, and you take the journey. And the writers and producers are really kind. If there's some place we don't really want to go or we really don't feel safe, we can go to them, and generally they'll change the course or direction for us.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nSeason 5 is perhaps the shows most successful year to date. It's always been a ratings winner - ever since the \"Pilot\" - but it's clear from watching the fifth series that the producers have grown supremely confident. The budget seems even higher than before, helping CSI to match (or, in some cases, exceed) your average crime movie. The formula has become routine, and audiences know exactly what to expect. It's a phenomenon in television terms, and a fully-fledged franchise (no matter how good Miami and NY are, I still rate the original higher). Therefore, you'd expect the writers to sit back and take it easy - they aren't inventing the wheel anymore. But they didn't. Safe from cancellation, and revelling in the joys of syndication, they decided to rock the boat. Season 5 concentrates much-more on the team dynamic than previous series; effectively playing with the group we've come to love, and even developing characters. CSI is largely about collecting the evidence, and rarely gives the characters room to evolve. Fortunately, there are several episodes here that buck the trend, and the finale in particular promises to change one of the character's forever.\n\nSuch risks with an ageing formula made some fans uneasy; proclaiming that CSI was about to \"jump the shark.\" Pish-posh! Solving crimes is still the main focus, and the increase in character development merely helps to give the series extra allure. As it hit the mighty 100th episode, the show took a U-turn; executing a sub-plot that had been building for some time. That villainous day-shift manager Conrad Ecklie (Marc Vann) got his promotion as assistant head of the lab, and proceeded to split-up Grissom.s team. One of the highlights of a busy season, \"Mea Culpa\" sees the team questioned at every turn by the goon, who is taking great relish in screwing with Grissom. Ooh, that Ecklie! Boo, hiss! The result mixes up the team; Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) gets Nick (George Eads) and Warrick (Gary Dourdan), who end up working the swing shift. At least Grissom still has Sara (Jorja Fox), although their romantic sub-plot has disappeared.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nShe's been working in some of the best shows on US TV for a full decade - ER and The West Wing among them. But it's CSI which has made her a household name. We spoke to the actress on set of the world's most popular show.\n\nHow is Season Six coming along?  \n  \nIt's flying by - it's almost over, which is weird, they go so fast now. The first couple of years you feel like three years of your life have passed when you finish a season, and now we blink and we've got five shows left or something. It's been going really good, I think they're some of the best stories we've told actually.\n\nDo you get annoyed by all these copies?  \n  \nI did. It's a form of flattery I guess, and you've got to take that with a grain of salt. But it's cool, because in the beginning, other than William Petersen who did Manhunter back in the '80s, it was this topic that had been explored very minimally - a couple of documentaries, and we were first in with that.\n\nWhat do you like best about your character?  \n  \nI love that I'm playing someone who's like worlds smarter than I am! It's a really great feeling that - always a good reason to get out of bed, like \"I went to Harvard and Berkeley and studied physics, nuclear fission...\"\n\nDid you watch a lot of TV as a kid?  \n  \nI was a TV junkie - I still have to watch myself. There was a period, it was my babysitter and my best friend from age five to thirteen. Then I didn't have one for ten years - I left home, and it was like \"Oh there's a real world, maybe I can do some of the shit I see on TV in the real world!\" But certainly MASH is one of my all-time favourites. I love The Partridge Family, it was the baaad Brady Bunch. I liked the Brady Bunch too. As I got older I loved Charlie's Angels and The Bionic Woman - there were some really cool shows with women that were sort of on TV for the first time. They'd show this bad-ass chick in high heels arresting people, I liked all those!\n\nHow do you find doing the more character-driven episodes?  \n  \nI think we all get really excited. Also it's kind of scary, especially if you're going some place that the show hasn't gone so much before. I feel I've been really lucky in that way, I've got to be the guinea pig a couple of times; it's amazing and fun and terrifying, and I'm always just crossing my fingers and hoping that it works. It's been really nice to see a lot of the other characters do that this year.\n\nAnd how was getting to work with Quentin?  \n  \nIt was fantastic. It was madness - in the nicest way possible. He's a really gracious, loving man, he knows everyone's names and everyone hears a couple of times a day how wonderful they're doing and it's just a nice feeling. Especially at episode 23, when you're at that point where the last thing you really care about on earth is your lines because you're already virtually on vacation. And he came along, everybody just hooked in and gave it every last thing that they had for those twelve days or so. It was closest thing that I've been to in years to a feature film, so for a million reasons it was awesome.\n\nYou must have had offers for feature films during your hiatus?  \n  \nYeah, scary. I really wanted to, but I'm not a workaholic like many people in this town. I wanted to do it last year, I got offered a couple of things that I didn't love, and then the stuff that I wanted to do I didn't get, so I took it as a sign to goof off! This summer I'm going to be in London actually, I'm producing a play, a musical which is going out. It's at the Riverside. I'm going to spend at least four weeks doing that and I'm still looking for a movie to do.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the closing gap in quality between TV and Movies?  \n  \nWatching it for so long, from the time of Robin Williams on Mork and Mindy, to Michael J Fox, I'd always put movies on a pedestal and never really wanted to do TV at all. But TV kept calling me and saying \"Hey you want a job?\" Movies really hadn't been calling all that much! (laughs) So finally I was able to forget movies. I have a little bit of that competitive energy now, I think the hierarchy puts movie stars way ahead of TV stars. At the same time, if you're lucky as we have been, you're entertaining like 25, 30 million people every week which most of these movie stars can't say, so there's that.\n\nHow do you deal with the pressure?  \n  \nI think the really big part of that pressure falls on the writers' shoulders more than us. Certainly we feel it a little bit, but those other guys have to come up with the stories to keep people tuning in from week to week. I'm sure people get really bored of us.\n\nHow much input into character do you get?  \n  \nWe're pretty vocal (laughs) and Billy, to his credit, from the very beginning would have a very communal, collective way of working: you'd take a script and people might come in with their ideas and everybody hacks it out. And people are pretty open-minded to that. It's pretty rare on TV.\n\nWhat was the situation with holding out for more money?  \n  \n(laughs) I wasn't holding out for more money, I merely wanted a raise! There's an understanding at least in the States in the last 35 years or so, that if a show is doing well and you're lucky enough to be working on that show, not necessarily if you deserve it (laughs) but if you're lucky enough it floats, it arrives there. And I, who had been spoiled enough to come from The ER and West Wing before I came to this show, had only really known that as an example of how things worked, so it's a very normal thing in the television business that if a show is doing really well that every two years, many of the cast, including the crew and other people, will go in and ask for a raise. Anything can happen from that, and I'm sure you've seen some really dramatic stuff on TV where people really hold out for it, in this case nothing like that happened &#8212; they invited George and I not to come to work, and then they changed their minds.\n\nDo you have a plan beyond CSI?  \n  \nI'd love to be a producer when I grow up. I'm trying, like the play this summer and other than that I'm pretty open, I mean obviously I'll keep acting as long as people keep being willing to work with me you know. I'm lucky, I've just done my tenth year on network television in a row, so I do think there's a part of me that's like, \"Man, I should just go work on a farm for a year!\" and then try and come back. Take a little break and get out of people's living rooms (laughs).\n\n",

The action begins when Grissom (WILLIAM PETERSEN), Nick Stokes (GEORGE EADS), Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX) and Captain Jim Brass (PAUL GUILFOYLE) attend a wedding at which the groom's mother is murdered.\n\n\"It is a fascinating, sort of character-driven, dark comedy which we rarely do,\" Jorja tells ET. \"What we have is the case of a successful defense attorney, who has represented a lot of less than upstanding characters, who meets a very unpleasant demise at her son's wedding. We try to put the events together, who killed her and why. Of course, there is a twist at the end.\"\n\nThe matter is complicated by the fact that the woman (played by guest star VERONICA CARTWRIGHT) is not popular with a majority of the wedding guests; plus, several of the less-than-upstanding characters that Jorja mentioned are high-level mobsters.\n\nIt takes the CSI team 11 hours to interview all 200 witnesses and collect the evidence from the murder scene, so a very exhausted Sara, Nick and Greg Sanders (ERIC SZMANDA) stop for breakfast. Then, Nick's car is stolen &#8212; along with all the evidence.\n\n\"One of the things I love about this script is that the people at the crime scene, including [the CSIs], recount the events of the wedding, so you get a different flavor of what people see and what their perceptions are,\" Jorja continues. \"We have to recount the events because something happens to all of our evidence. Those perspectives are kind of unique considering we all work together and spend a lot of time together. They are all flavored with our own styles and thoughts. I laughed my head off when I read the script, so I hope the audience will, too.\"\n\nAccording to Jorja, Sara hates weddings, which is something they have in common. \"I am not really acting in this episode, I just show up,\" says the 37-year-old single actress, who admits she has commitment issues. \"Deep down inside, I think there is a romantic that lives inside Sara, but I think she thinks that a lot of people get married for the wrong reason and the wrong way and this wedding is a good example.\"\n\nFor a sneak peek at the \"Rashomama\" episode of \"CSI,\" tune in to tonight's ET!\n\n",

Now, Fox hopes to generate the same amount of buzz for vegetarianism as she has for forensic science. In her new ad for PETA, Fox encourages people to \"investigate vegetarianism\"-something she's been doing for 20 years.\n\n\"[I]f you just cut down [on meat] or tried [vegetarianism], you might find that you love it,\" Fox says in her exclusive interview with PETA. \"And the list of things that you'd be doing positively to affect the planet and the next seven generations that come after you is humongous.\" And she's not kidding-in response to animal welfare, world hunger, and environmental concerns, compassionate people everywhere are adopting a vegetarian diet.\n\nMeat: A Crime Against Animals and the Environment\n\nEvery year in the United States, more than 27 billion animals are slaughtered for food. Animals on today's factory farms have no legal protection from cruelty that would be illegal if it were inflicted on dogs or cats: neglect, mutilation, genetic manipulation, drug regimens that cause chronic pain and crippling, transport through all weather extremes, and gruesome and violent slaughter.\n\nMore than half of the water used in the U.S. goes to animal agriculture, and since farmed animals produce 130 times more excrement than the human population does but without benefit of a sewage system, the run-off from their waste pollutes our waterways. Animal excrement emits gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, which are major contributors to global warming. Forests are being bulldozed to make room for factory farms and feed crops, causing soil erosion, species extinction, and habitat loss. Farmed animals consume 70 percent of the corn, wheat, and other grain that we grow, and one-third of all the raw materials and fossil fuels used in the U.S. go toward raising animals for food.\n\nFox knows the stats all too well: \"I think society can best be judged on how they treat their elderly, their kids, and their animals. ... If that's something that doesn't resonate with you, think of world hunger, and think of the rain forest depreciating, and think of global warming. All of these things can be traced pretty powerfully to eating meat.\"\n\nIf you'd like to investigate vegetarianism, PETA has all the information to get you started. Order your free vegetarian starter kit today or follow Fox's lead: \"[D]o some reading, get on the Web, ... check out PETA.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nFor a season finale, the series leaves viewers on a sour note and cranks up the cheese more than usual\n\nYou expect a certain amount of cheese when you watch CSI, but the season finale \"Way To Go,\" was much worse than usual. There were a number of lines, which I like to call groaners, that were added to get a laugh, but instead caused me to audibly groan to ease the pain inflicted by terrible writing. When it was all said and done, the last ten seconds will give everyone something to talk about during the long summer hiatus, but the previous 58 minutes were nothing special. (SPOILER ALERT)\n\nFor those of you who caught last week's episode (the first of a two-parter) we were thrust back into Captain Brass's (Paul Guilfoyle) fight for life after being shot during a hostage negotiation. We are then treated to a flashback explaining how Grissom (William Petersen) gained power of attorney concerning Brass's medical condition. From here we jump into a standard episode where we have two murders. One a decapitated body found near the railroad tracks, the other concerns a heavy partier who may have over done the festivities.\n\nThere is nothing to say about the episode. For fans familiar with the show we see the usual arc of having the CSIs following the clues until we find out exactly what caused these two people to end up dead. This was a weak two-part episode unlike \"A Bullet Runs Through It,\" from earlier in the season, when Brass accidentally shot a fellow officer. This episode utilized the shooting of Brass as the lone connection to the part one. Brass's fight for his life took up very little air time, and is a red herring for what is the real cliff hanger.\n\nAs expected, they capture their killers, but this episode puts a little more emphasis on family as Brass's daughter Ellie comes into town because of her father's shooting. Ellie is a person of ill repute, and a former crack addict who has come into town, not to see her dying father, but to claim what Brass leaves behind. Grissom attempts to show Ellie how much Brass loves her, but when she realizes that he is going to pull through she bolts. This leaves Brass with the people who truly care about him, although (as we learned earlier) they don't pal around outside of the work place.\n\nWhat is really going to stir the imaginations of fans is the final scene. Grissom is laying in bed wearing a blue Hawaiian shirt explaining how he wishes to know when he is going to die. The camera is panning around him as he lies there talking to an unknown person, finally we see a robe appear in the bathroom doorway. After a few moments of taking in the unknown, the figure is revealed to be Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox).\n\nAlthough it is great to finally see Grissom and Sara together, one has to hope that the show won't stray too far from what makes it popular - the science. CSIhas shown a weakness when it comes to focusing on the characters' backgrounds. I tend to believe that they would do best to not revolve around the possible relationship. There has been hints at a possible connection between the two for years now, but they can't turn this into the next Ross and Rachel fiasco. Touch on it, use it for a couple of story arcs but never let it be the focus of the show. While this was a great twist for loyal fans, we may be looking at the point where CSIhas finally jumped the shark.\n\n",

This was a landmark test case for the U.S. government and the first of its kind using the Animal Enterprise Protection Act. The defendants said it was a &#8216;freedom of speech' issue, and the U.S. government disagrees and call them \"thugs\".\n\nProducer/director Curt Johnson follows this historic case in his latest film \"Your Mommy Kills Animals\"; an indepth look at the animal rights movement and the FBI's recent declaration calling them the &#8216;number one domestic terrorist threat to the United States'. Johnson's recent films include the 2002 Academy Award winning documentary \"Thoth\". The film looks at both sides of the animal rights movement.\n\n[...]\n\nThe film is slated for a spring 2007 national theatrical release and includes child star Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy from \"Peanuts\", \"Lassie\", \"Odd Couple\"), Willie Nelson, Moby, Joe Mantegna, Jorja Fox, Drew Carey, Ben Stein among others voicing their opinions on this controversial movement and trial.\n\nFor more information: www.myspace.com/yourmommykillsanimals.\n\n",

        "content": "\nRomance blossomed at end of CBS show's sixth season\n\nTV's highest-rated scripted show, which is all about science, has proven a crucial law of nature.\n\nOpposites attract.\n\nThe stoic Gil Grissom and the more emotional Sara Sidle have become a couple on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" (9 p.m. Thursdays on CBS). But it's no surprise to Executive Producer Carol Mendelsohn, who has seen this coming for a long time.\n\nMendelsohn said the writers have debated since the first season whether Grissom and Sara, two forensic investigators, would ever get together.\n\n\"I happen to think that they were intimate in San Francisco (where they worked together), but not intimate once they got to Las Vegas, at least not in the beginning. And since I'm the showrunner, you know, I won the debate.\"\n\nThe romance comes as \"CSI\" faces some competition. \"Grey's Anatomy,\" a popular medical drama with its share of love, will move this fall to 9 p.m. Thursdays on ABC. But at a Television Critics Association conference, \"CSI\" actors and producers say they look forward to being challenged.\n\n\"ABC moving the show opposite of us, I think, was the biggest motivator we could have had,\" said Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows. \"We're all excited about it. I think it's given us like, hey, we don't want to relinquish the throne that easily.\"\n\nJorja Fox, who plays Sara, said the beauty of a popular long-running series is the plots that the actors can't predict.\n\n\"I think Gary (Dourdan) might not have had any idea that (his character, Warrick Brown) would be married. Or I don't think George (Eads) had any idea that he would spend 48 hours in a box (in the episode in which his character, Nick Stokes, is buried alive). You know, you just get this little description and you take this journey.\"\n\nFox said she liked how the writers ended last season by showing Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara suddenly together in a romantic relationship.\n\n\"And we don't know how long this has been going on. And I think that was a really brilliant way to do it.\n\n\"I think the idea right now going into Season 7 is that Grissom and Sara and the beautiful audience are the only people who know this is actually taking place,\" Fox said.\n\nFox said viewers are split 50-50 about whether \"CSI\" should focus strictly on its murder stories or allow some character-driven tales such as the new love story.\n\n\"And I think the writers did something bold and brilliant by trying to just really follow their hearts, which is what I think we try to do.\"\n\nFox said she can see why Sara would be interested in the stoic Grissom, even if it means she might have to take the lead in expressing emotions.\n\nTheir work &#8212; solving murders through forensics work &#8212; is the common thread that has pulled them together, Fox said after the news conference.\n\n\"They both have a real need for the truth.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nShe's played Sara Sidle in the hit American forensics drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for six years, but Jorja Fox says she still isn't bored with the role. \n\nUnfortunately though, some of her scenes still make her stomach turn, which is a bit of a problem for someone playing a forensic scientist.\n\n\"I had a bit of an epiphany about it this year. I'm not squeamish in general and I realised that it's not what I'm looking at that makes me squeamish, it's the why and the how.\n\n\"The victims on our shows mostly come to a very violent demise, and that's the part that freaks me out. It was nice to figure that out. Not liking violence is something I don't mind being stuck with.\"\n\nIt's unusual for an actor to stay in one role for so long, but Jorja is in good company. Unlike other American ensemble dramas like ER or The West Wing, none of the central cast members (William L Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, George Eads and Paul Guilfoyle) have left for \\`new challenges'. What's keeping them there?\n\nLucky\n\n\"I think we really love each other,\" says the 37-year-old. \"We really got very lucky. I know that Bill Petersen was involved in the casting and he tells a story that what he was looking for more than anything else was a group of people who would have fun together.\"\n\nIn 2004 this tight unit was nearly ripped apart, when Jorja and George Eads were fired. Jorja was told her services would no longer be needed just before filming started on the fifth series.\n\nGeorge's departure quickly followed when he turned up late for the first day's shooting. The reasons for Jorja's sacking were less clear, with reports at the time citing an alleged failure to send a letter to CBS, who make CSI, saying she would be on time for shooting.\n\n\"That's a big long story,\" says Jorja, \"and there's a lot of different stories.\n\n\"But all's well that ends well. I was indeed fired. For, like, nine days. I've never been fired, ever, for anything. So in a way it was a kind of cool rite of passage.\"\n\nPressed about the reasons for her sacking, Jorja merely says it was a huge misunderstanding.\n\n\"I think, with all due respect, big companies sometimes do things to send a strong message to a lot of people,\" she says. \"Everybody that year put in for a raise. That's very customary on an American show if it's doing well - every two years you put in for a raise.\n\n\"But it was also a year that two other Top 10 shows from CBS would be putting in for raises. So I think that a very astute businessman might think to himself, that could be a lot of raises. Their way of discouraging that was, I think, very effective.\"\n\nJorja implies that it's thanks to the rest of the cast that she got her job back so quickly.\n\nCast\n\n\"Most of the cast wasn't at work that day,\" she grins.\n\nIt was also widely reported that Jorja refused to sign back on until her friend George was also re-hired.\n\nOf course, the episode had a happy ending and the mutiny has come to an end on the good ship CSI.\n\nThe show recently aired its most shocking finale in the US (where it still attracts over 25million viewers) and the sixth season is also about to come to an end here (where it gets a very healthy 4m).\n\n\"This finale is a phenomenal thrill ride,\" Jorja says. \"There's an extra little surprise at the end of the second part that comes completely unexpected.\n\n\"We've never done traditional cliff-hangers before and I think there might be about 4m jaws dropped when it airs.\"\n\nOutside CSI, Jorja flexes her creative muscles with her side project Honeypot Productions, a theatre company she set up with friend and former Murmurs singer Heather Reid.\n\nWhile the theatre work is an exciting string to her bow, Jorja maintains she is happy to stay with CSI and can't wait to start work on the seventh season.\n\n\"I would have thought after two or three years I would have been bored of the character. But it's still a great feeling to know I'm going back.\"\n\n",

It's been in the works for six years, Fox said at the Television Critics Association's summer meeting.\n\n\"In this tiny little character description that you get when you're trying out for a show, it suggested that she was a love interest for Gil Grissom,\" Fox said. \"Being that it was there, along with other little strange things &#8212; she could drink anybody under the table and had some social problems &#8212; I was very intrigued and sort of had been gearing up from the beginning of the show that this might happen.\"\n\nThe couple won't be going public. \"In this instance, the viewers will be ahead of our CSIs,\" said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. \"The viewers will be in on it, but the CSIs will not know.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nEven longtime viewers of CSI were surprised at the revelation at the end of last season that the characters of Grissom and Sara &#8212; played respectively by William Petersen and Jorja Fox &#8212; have been involved in a relationship for some time. Now, the biggest mystery on the show doesn't involve the victim of the week, but how long that relationship has been going and how they've managed to keep it quiet all this time? At the TCA press tour yesterday, Fox came clean to Now Playing on where the storyline came from and where it's going in season seven.\n\n\"I think one of the coolest things about it, and the way that the story ended up being delivered at the end of the season &#8212; and [it was] quite really brilliant, as I think the writers are &#8212; is that we suddenly find these characters together, and we know not how long this has been going on,\" Fox said. \"And I think that was a really brilliant way to do it. I think it's going to open a lot of ideas for the characters.\"\n\nCoincidentally or not, ABC has moved ratings powerhouse Grey's Anatomy into the Thursday night timeslot opposite CSI this season. Earlier in the press tour, CBS president Nina Tassler told critics that CSI is in the surprising position of being the underdog, and she's expecting the series to \"get dinged\" by the move. Unsurprisingly, there will be a drive this season to do more personal stories than ever before to retain viewers who might be more interested in the romantic entanglements between Meredith and McDreamy than DNA testing and autopsy reports. But in an interview after the panel, Fox pointed out that the idea to show the relationship came about before the move was announced.\n\n\"Grey's is very celebrated for a lot of good reasons,\" she said. \"One of them has a lot to do with the personal lives of their characters. The good thing I can say about Sara and Grissom is that idea started before we knew we were going up against Grey's. I mean, obviously the Sara-Grissom thing has gone on for six years, but the idea to bring that to light happened before we knew we were going to be up against Grey's. So I think there will be very little about our show that will change. I don't think we're going to be more like Grey's. I think that would be very foolish of us to do.\"\n\nThe direction has already drawn strong fan reactions on both sides. The controversy has caused Fox to feel a little apprehensive going into the new season, something she hasn't felt on CSI in a long time. \"I was really nervous, because you're so invested in characters,\" Fox said. \"I think it's a cool storyline and it's untraditional; it's slightly taboo, it's slightly scandalous. There's a million reasons to love it as an actor, to tell the truth. I love working with Billy [Petersen]. Obviously, the first two seasons we worked a lot together. I actually couldn't stand him for the first few months we worked together. And he knows that, so I can tell you that. And I really thought, &#8216;How am going to make it through this show? I don't even like this guy.' And something happened right around December, where we pushed through something. I don't think he liked me that much either, to be perfectly honest. And all of a sudden we found this rhythm and this place. So it's really exciting to get to take it on.\"\n\n",

But as one of the stars of \"CSI\", Jorja has given the CBS drama a hot new look, with her character, Sara Sidle, going from crime scenes to love scenes. Her surprising romance with fellow forensics investigator Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen) is keeping fans guessing at the snow near the top of the ratings in its Thursday-night battle against ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy\",\n\n\"I'm really exited about the thing between Grissom and Sara,\" Jorja told \"OK!\". \"What's not sexy about William Petersen? Going into the seventh year of a show, to have something so big and so different to play after all this time is very unique and rare. We're having a ball. I hope the fans love it.\"\n\nA self-described hippie, Jorja often comes to work with her best friend, her dog Ali. \"I'm crazy for animals. I love them!\" Jorja said when we caught up with her at the Oct. 5 opening of the North Central Animal Care Center, a remodeled Los Angeles city shelter for dogs, cats and rabbits. Jorja couldn't be happier that the city has created a clean, safe facility where solar panels keep pets warm and a misting system keeps them cool until they can be adopted.\n\n\"I've been to the shelter a number of times,\" she said. \"I think it's better than anybody could even imagine it. I would invite everybody who lives in Los Angeles to come down and check it out to see the future of L.A. and the commitment of Angelenos to caring for pets.\"\n\nJorja's four-legged pal, Ali, 10, is a shelter dog herself and is named for the famous boxer Muhammad Ali. \"She's Ali the boxer, because she's so pretty,\" Jorja smiled. \"I've always had a dog in my life. I know this is a cliched thing to say, but she's my best friend.\"\n\nJorja's love for animals affects her diet as well. \"I am a 20-year vegetarian,\" she said. \"I eat a lot of grains and vegetables and fruit and soy products. I eat a little bit of dairy, especially if I can find it organic and made in local, humane and free-range conditions.\"\n\nStill, she does admit to allowing herself \"some\" splurges. \"Chocolate, coffee, pizza. And beer. I could show you my six-pack, which is not like most actresses' six-packs in this town!\"\n\nCalling herself a minimalist who doesn't like to collect too many things, Jorja does make an exception for jeans. \"I probably have 10 pairs of sneakers and nine pares of jeans. I like the old-school Levi's and Wrangler's that you might get an at army surplus store. I also wear a lot of Seven and True Religion.\"\n\nJorja says in shape by running, hiking, camping and kayaking. She also finds herself surfing \"just for the fun of it,\" she said. \"I'm kind of goal oriented, and when I'm surfing, I have no goals at all. I just like to enjoy myself.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old star who once played rock music has put it on the back burner to focus on \"CSI\". \"I get together with friends and play music from time to time, in the adult-alternative vein,\" she said. \"I don't have the time to actually be in a band. Someday, when \"CSI\" is over and done, maybe I'll start a new bad. Mostly I play guitar; most people don't care for my singing. But I love to sing, so I do it a little bit,\" she smiles.\n\nJorja's other favorite side project is producing plays. On her next hiatus, she hopes to help her friend, actress Kirsten Holly Smith, continue her one-woman show, \"Blue-Eyed Soul: The Life and Times of Music Legend Dusty Springfield\", the story of the famed '60s soul singer.\n\nBut her focus this fall is on her show, as \"CSI\" faces a ratings challenge from the sexy doctors of \"Grey's Anatomy\". \"We've been number one for longer than I ever thought it would be possible to hold that title,\" she said. \"it's been an amazing ride. I'd love to stay there. I think that we've all got our game faces on and we're going into the season very humble and very hungry. It's nice to have some competition. But I do hope we win!\"\n\n",

CBS will not be changing the name of its hit drama to \"When Sara Met Grissom.\" But the network will continue to explore the love of these two forensic nerds.\n\nJorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the Top 10-rated series, says she's excited about the possibilities. Fox says she's excited that Sara and Gil are finally acting on the sexual tension in the series' seventh season.\n\nThe May-December romance (actor William Petersen is 53, so presumably his character is, too) also brings Fox a little job security. Two years ago, CBS fired and then rehired Fox after she initially refused to sign a return-to-work agreement.\n\nHere's what the 38-year-old New York native had to say:\n\nOn Sara and Gil hooking up: \"Sara was originally a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom. So being that it was on there (the original script), I was very intrigued and sort of thought it might happen. I think one of the coolest things about it, and the way that the story ended up being delivered at the end of season six, is to suddenly find these characters together, and we know how long it's been going on.

Fox initially thought she didn't need her bosses' permission to take part in the People For The Ethical Treatment of Animals &#8216;Investigate Vegetarianism' ad but has started to worry.\n\nIn the ad, Fox appears in a dimly-lit alleyway, which is cordoned off by police tape. The actress, a longtime vegetarian, says, \"I didn't see that there was anything controversial, or even confrontational, about it. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fox is celebrating after learning CSI co-star William Petersen has just dropped meat from his diet.

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation caught almost everyone off guard in the season finale when it was revealed that Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, the characters played by William L. Petersen and Jorja Fox, have had a thing going on for goodness knows how long.\n\nWho knew?\n\nActually, Fox did. Given that the series has been almost all business, it might seem the detour into romance is a reaction to the move of Grey's Anatomy into the Thursday-night-at-9 time slot this fall. Not so, Fox said; this has been in the works since the very beginning six years ago.\n\n\"In this tiny little character description that you get when you're trying out for a show, it suggested that she was a love interest for Gil Grissom,\" Fox said. \"Being that it was there, along with other little strange things &#8212; she could drink anybody under the table and had some social problems &#8212; I was very intrigued and sort of had been gearing up from the beginning of the show that this might happen.\"\n\nEven after the decision to go ahead had been made, there were fine points to be worked out. \"There have been raging debates in the writers' room since season one about Sara's relationship with Grissom pre-Las Vegas. What actually happened in San Francisco [where both previously worked]?\" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn said.\n\n\"The room was fairly divided and has been over the seasons. I happen to think they were intimate in San Francisco but not once they got to Las Vegas, at least in the beginning. Since I'm the show runner, I won the debate.\"\n\n[...]\n\nStill, the sexy relationship between Gil and Sara figures to be the one to dominate water-cooler conversation. It already has generated a lot of reaction, according to Mendelsohn. \"I came back from hiatus and had all these letters on my desk from around the world. I had letters from students at Harvard, science teachers, viewers from Italy.\"\n\nFan approval seems to be running about 60-40 in favor. Even those who disagree found something to like, Mendelsohn said. \"Across the board, fans wrote it was such a pleasure to see that two adults, two professionals, who are so good at their jobs, have found each other and are now engaged in an intimate and mature relationship that's not salacious. You don't see them ripping off each other's clothes.\"\n\n\"That's this season,\" Fox countered. \"Billy and I have been working out all summer.\"\n\nShe was kidding. However, if Grey's Anatomy proves to be a really tough competitor, you never know.\n\n",

In London she enjoys certain anonymity but she's not adverse to some of the trappings of fame that CSI brings. \"I've gotten better tables in restaurants and wait in line less which is always really wonderful; people have been really friendly.\"\n\nJorja Fox is currently between series in CSI and is using her free time to produce a play in London. Having had success in 2004 with rock musical Dear Bernard, she's bringing it to the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith. \"I'm thrilled that we've been invited, but it's also really scary. We'll just have to see what happens.\" The trip to London to work in theatre is a rare burst of activity for Jorja during time out from being knee deep in death in CSI. \"All I usually want to do is go see Disney movies and comedies anything that's not about death\". \"I'm really into silly, stupid, shallow activities I really love to go surfing, go barefoot and try to wear as few clothes as possible.\n\nApart from padding around barely dressed JF's other great passion is animals. While the actress is guarded about her love life, she's happy to talk about the menagerie she has at her LA home. \"I have a boxer dog, Ali, and 50 fish in my backyard. The fish came with the house and I was going to replace them with a jacuzzi but after 2 weeks I fell in love with them.\n\nJorja's passion for animals goes beyond keeping an ark full of pets; she's a keen supporter of militant animal rights group PETA. Jorja has also long been a vegetarian, and is understood to have converted CSI co-star William Petersen. In career terms CSI's Jorja Fox has scaled the heights starring in one of the planets most popular shows.

I just go about my life and sometimes people say hello, and that's a really nice feeling. It's a big compliment.\"\n\nIt's six years since Jerry Bruckhelmer's CSI began and it shows no sign of shuffling off this mortal coil. Investigations in season six have proved macabre, complex and glossy as ever.\n\n\"It does get harder and scarier to do that,\" says Jorja Fox. \"But the sad thing is there's no shortage of material for the show. So many shows are based on real life. But I do think this season had some of the best script's we have ever done.\"\n\nJorja Fox says fans are in for a real treat with the finale of the latest CSI series, to air shortly on Five. \"What we've tries to do is wake people out of their seats\" she says. \"I'm hoping that the 3 million folks in the UK who watch will have to pick their jaws off the floor.\"\n\nFilming of the next series begins in August. \"I think series seven is going to be about everyboby following their hearts,\" says Jorja cryptically.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of CSI is the lack of private life divulged about the characters.\n\n\"I think it's a testament to the show that after six series most of the characters are still mysterious,\" says Jorja Fox. \"And I really like that. I really like that it's been a slow peel of an onion, and hopefully when we do tell stuff viewers are excited about it rather than thinking they knew whatever it was already.\"\n\nDespite only near flickers of chemistry, the relationship between Gill Grissom and Sara Sidle fascinates many CSI devotees.\n\n\"It is one of the bigger questions that people still want to know, which is great,\" says Jorja Fox (Sara). \"It is one of my favourite storylines. I think for these two characters who live amid all the darkness, it's nice there's this stream of light. It's kind of a nice idea.\"\n\nThe CSI character who seems to provoke the most interest is the obsessive, enigmatic Gil Grissom, Played by William Petersen.\n\n\"We worked together a lot in the first two aeasons and became very close friends\" says Jorja Fox. \"He thinks he's nothing like Grissom, but I'm not so sure,\" she adds, laughing. \"He is actually really funny but he doesn't have dry quotes in his head like Grissom does-thankfully.\"\n\nSara Sidle is a work of fiction, but Jorja Fox admits after playing her for six years, a synergy has developed. \"The longer I do It, I feel we're the same person,\" She admits. \"I feel she's an alter ego. We both have that OCD-Type A, focused and, like her, I can socially be a bit off sometimes. I love playing her I have dreams and hopes for her, but she's much smarter that I am I could never be a CSI.\"\n\n",

It's impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven't though about killing Sara. She's had almost everything else happen to her &#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating ... She's been the team's scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest. At last, I can finally smile on screen!\n\nAfter seven years are you used to seeing corpses?  \n  \nI'm stronger now, but I sometimes want to puke when I see all the special effects made by our special effects! Outdoing other TV shows has become a game for them. They never run out of ideas to show amazing deaths.\n\nAll this [death] doesn't seem to make for a cheerful atmosphere on the set!  \n  \nNot at all! We laugh and we play music. We made a band &#8212; the actors and the technicians. Marg Helgenberger plays piano, Gary Dourdan plays bass and Robert David Hall plays guitar. I even want to film one of our impromptu gigs for our fans!\n\nWhen you meet fans, what do you talk about ?  \n  \nAll of them want to see Sara and Gil have a love story, which is going to happen in the new season. But \"CSI\" isn't about the private lives of its heroes. Mysteries are at the heart of every episode.\n\nAre you surprised by the infatuation of viewers about \"CSI\" ?  \n  \nWhat really surprised me is the interest our fans have in crimes. Some of them tell me complex scenarios about the best way to kill someone. At first, I was terrified about it and I felt like I had serial killers in front of me! Now I'm more relaxed and I joke with them.\n\nWe know very little about your private life. Why are you so secret ?  \n  \nI think it's very important to keep the mystery secret. And also it's good for the audience, so that people don't confuse me with my character on \"CSI\".\n\nYou never act in movies during your summer holiday. Is it a personal choice ?  \n  \nI work 14 hour days for nine and a half months and I don't want to run everywhere during my holidays. Seven years ago, I created my own theater troupe. That's how I relax.\n\nDo you have a theater project going on?  \n  \nI'm a producer of \"Dear Bernard\", a musical comedy about an English girl who comes to Hollywood to be successful. I also suggested to the \"CSI\" producers that we write a musical episode for this season. Wouldn't it be funny to see Grissom and his team singing during autopsies? We could even pretend it was all Sara's dream!\n\n",

But it's no surprise to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn, who has seen this coming for a long time.\n\nMendelsohn says the writers have debated since the first season whether Grissom and Sidle, two forensic investigators, were ever together. \"I happen to think that they were intimate in San Francisco (where they worked together), but not intimate once they got to Las Vegas, at least not in the beginning. And since I'm the showrunner, you know, I won the debate.\"  \nThe romance comes as \"CSI\" faces some competition. \"Grey's Anatomy,\" a popular medical drama with its share of love, will move this fall to 9 p.m. Thursdays on ABC.\n\nFox says the beauty of a popular long-running series is the plots that the actors can't predict. \"I think Gary (Dourdan) might not have had any idea that (his character, Warrick Brown) would be married. Or I don't think George (Eads) had any idea that he would spend 48 hours in a box (in the episode in which his character, Nick Stokes, is buried alive). You know, you just get this little description and you take this journey.\"\n\nFox says she liked how the writers ended last season by showing Grissom and Sidle suddenly together in a romantic relationship. \"And we don't know how long this has been going on. And I think that was a really brilliant way to do it.\n\n\"I think the idea right now going into season seven is that Grissom and Sara and the beautiful audience are the only people who know this is actually taking place,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says viewers are split 50-50 about whether \"CSI\" should focus strictly on its murder stories or allow some character-driven tales, such as the new love story. \"And I think the writers did something bold and brilliant by trying to just really follow their hearts, which is what I think we try to do.\"\n\n",

It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale (warning, don't read this if you haven't seen the \"CSI\" season-ender yet):\n\nI got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: \"The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a &#8216;Bizarro World CSI,' as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death. We are supposed to believe that Grissom, who has spent the past six seasons avoiding Sara or sharing terse, tension-filled moments with her, has been lying all along and that they are longtime lovers. Huh?\n\n\"Suspending disbelief is one thing and &#8216;CSI' does stretch credulity often, but this episode was simply a travesty. Poorly written and conceived, it has disappointed and even enraged many loyal fans. Paul Guilfoyle's ace performance was pushed aside for the Grissom and Sara Show, a pairing that makes no sense on any level.\n\n\"I have never missed a new episode of &#8216;CSI' but I wish I had missed this one and I doubt that I will be able to bear watching it in the future.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nThat sound you heard at 9 p.m. on May 18 was collective gasping from millions of \"CSI\" fans as they watched an intimate scene from the show's season finale, in which Gil Grissom (William Petersen) chatted casually with co-worker Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) &#8212; in a bedroom.\n\nThe two investigators are in a relationship, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms. And it's \"not so new.\"\n\nShe says the show's many law-enforcement contacts say that those who work in the crime field are often attracted to each other, due to shared experiences and interests. She adds that Grissom's relationship with Sidle is part of the character's ongoing evolution.\n\n\"In real life, relationships take a long time to develop. Real life isn't a soap opera. And real lives change and flow. And I think Grissom has changed over the six seasons\" of \"CSI,\" says Mendelsohn (who, like star Petersen, is a Chicagoan).\n\n\"I think Grissom always believed that to operate at the highest level professionally, he needed to stand a distance away from people,\" she adds. \"He needed to be objective;, he couldn't be subjective. But while you're resisting all that, life happens.\"\n\nFor those who might have thought the actors had to be talked into the plot development &#8212; far from it, according to Mendelsohn. The actors jumped at the chance to portray the relationship, she says, and Petersen was so into it that he even picked the shirt he wore in the scene.\n\nMendelsohn says the growing number of revelations about the \"CSI\" characters' personal lives is a result of the actors' desires for those kinds of stories, and also springs from a wish on the part of the writers to show what makes the investigators tick. There's no pressure, she says, either from within the show or from the network, to make the show more like \"Grey's Anatomy,\" the hit medical soap that \"CSI\" will directly compete with in the fall.\n\n\"We are not a soap opera. We are not a serial,\" she says. \"We will always be a show about science, mystery, clues, and twists and turns. And this is a twist and turn. But it's not going to be the Grissom-Sara show from now on.\"\n\nAs for the fact that serialized, soapier shows are now the hot thing, Mendelsohn says, \"We have never, ever responded to external events, and I hope we don't, because I do believe that's when great shows stumble &#8212; when they allow external pressures to direct the story lines.\"\n\nAs for the competition with \"Grey's\" &#8212; a show she says she enjoys &#8212; Mendelsohn says, bring it on.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen but I do think we can both coexist on that night. And we're going to do our best to deliver the best season ever.\"\n\nThe text of my interview with Mendelsohn is below. \n\n*There was a huge response to the Gil-Sara scene, both positive and negative. But the first question I have to ask is, is the relationship new? *\n\n\"I think the viewers are always able to draw their own conclusions about the relationships. It was a very private, intimate moment and I think it suggested a level of comfortability that comes from a relationship that is not so new. \n\n\"You talk to people in law enforcement all the time, and [the law-enforcement veterans who work on the shows or consult for &#8216;CSI' shows] say law enforcement people tend to gravitate toward law enforcement people. What has always been true about &#8216;CSI' and what as writers we make every effort to maintain is &#8212; there's a reality to it. In real life, relationships take a long time to develop. Real life isn't a soap opera. And real lives change and flow. \n\n\"And I think Grissom has changed over the six seasons. I believe that he always, from the beginning [when Grissom called in Sara in &#8216;Cool Change'], that it suggested that Grissom and Sara had a relationship [before she came to Las Vegas]. Whether it was platonic, whether they had once had an encounter in San Francisco - it's a matter of debate among the writers as I'm sure it is among the fans. \n\n*Is it accurate to say that Sara has been interested in Gil for some time, but that he sort of held her off, flirting back but still holding her at bay to some extent? *\n\n\"I would say more precisely, what is accurate is that, yes, Sara has always been interested in Grissom. A confusion existed as to whether [it was as a] father figure, friend or more than that. \n\n\"But if you look at Gil Grissom, who is the center of our show and always has been, if you look at Gil Grissom's character from the pilot to Season 6, and you look at it as a crime scene, and look at the clues and look at the episodes, I think you discern an arc. Grissom in the pilot was much more open, more flirtatious. But over the course of the series we have seen Grissom be part of the world, withdraw from the world (which always means withdrawing from the people around him), [and] I think when he lost his hearing he retreated. When he got his hearing back I think he came back and embraced the world and got slapped in the face by all those ugly bad things out there again. \n\n\"An episode that the fans always point to is &#8216;Butterflied.' There we heard Grissom express for the first time his feelings for Sara Sidle and his reticence to ever go forward and pursue a relationship. And I think that it is from &#8216;Butterflied' on, that if you look Grissom, look at &#8216;Bloodlines,' which ended season 4 and going into season 5, [that is] where Grissom embraced his team... \n\n\"I think Grissom always believed that to operate at the highest level professionally, he needed to stand a distance away from people. He needed to be objective, he couldn't be subjective. But while you're resisting all that, life happens. The connection that Warrick and Nick expressed for Grissom in &#8216;Mea Culpa,' when Grissom lost his team, is something that Grissom felt too. Unexpressed, albeit. You can say I don't want to be a family with these people, I want to keep my distance, but the truth is, over time, he got very close to them and he cared for them. \n\n\"And I think that &#8216;Mea Culpa' and &#8216;Grave Danger' - the love of Grissom's team basically brought Nick to life. And I think that Grissom evolved even more Season 6. The straw hat's as perfect example. Grissom realizes life is short, Grissom realizes he is closer to the end of his career,&nbsp; at least at CSI &#8212; [though] he's still a young man - than he is to the beginning of his career. I think that he is suddenly of this world, cares about his people, and I think that slowly he allowed himself to open up to Sara. \n\n\"Obviously we are not a soap opera. We are not a serial. We will always be a show about science, mystery, clues and twists and turns. And this is a twist and turn. But it's not the Grissom-Sara show from now on.\" \n\nThere are a fair number of fans who commented on my site that they want the show to be about the casefiles, not *necessarily **about relationships.&nbsp; *\n\n\"I think we support those fans. The beauty of &#8216;CSI' is, yes, it is about the mystery and the science and the cases, but one of the other factors that has made us a fan favorite, what has made our fans so loyal, is that we have the best cast on television. And the characters that have been created by those actors and with the writers and with Anthony Zuiker, they're wonderful characters and people love them. And we sometimes stop for a moment, and it is just a brief moment, to allow those characters to live and breathe and express who they are, and I think that has been true from the beginning. \n\n\"A little always goes a long way on &#8216;CSI,' but a little always seems to be magnified on &#8216;CSI.' And the show has always told us what works and what doesn't work. We have, over the seasons, written many more character scenes that the fans never saw. We shot them, and we looked at them in the cutting room, and looked at them in the context of an entire episode, and they didn't work. \n\n\"I believe very strongly that Grissom would like people to believe that his brain is bigger than his heart. Because that makes it easier for him. But I think, when you are passionate about anything, and he's passionate about his career, that makes you capable of passion in other parts of your life. And I think that he does care and he does feel and that is what makes him a great CSI. \n\n\"And I really think that the scene is more about who the man is. This is a relationship that the audience is privy to but no one else at CSI is privy too. We decided [to do this] as writers, and after lengthy conversations with Billy and Jorja, because we would never go into this kind of scene without [consulting them]. As with everything on &#8216;CSI,' it's a collaboration. We believe it is grounded in reality, and I don't mean to speak for Jorja and Billy, but to see on television a relationship between mature, adult professionals is interesting. \n\n\"It doesn't mean that we're going to revisit it every week, but it means that we let the audience in, to get a glimpse of a very private Grissom. A Grissom with his clothes on, albeit he was lying in a bed, he was fully dressed [laughs]. But they never really touched.\" \n\nBilly Petersen is signed for one more season of \"CSI,\" right? Can you foresee a \"CSI\" without him?\n\n\"You'd have to ask Billy. I know he is signed for another season, beyond that I don't know. We all love Billy, and we all love Grissom. And there are some things in life you just don't want to think about. It's too hard to contemplate. We've always said to Billy, when you want to leave, let us know, let the writers know, and he's never said that. It's amazing that going into season 7 we have our entire cast intact. That's a testament to them. I assume if we have a very, very long run that we will lose some of our actors. But that's a long way of saying, I can't think that far [laughs]. \n\n\"Sometimes a great show has a heart that beats independently of all of us, the writers, everyone. ... I think the show's greatness exists apart from any one of us, or perhaps all of us. Can I say the show will go on? I think it will. Will the joy be gone in Mudville if we can't write for Billy and Grissom? Oh boy, yes. \n\n\"But at the moment the show is about Grissom and his team, and I hope it will always be about that.\" \n\nYou talked about consulting with Billy on that scene. Has there been a desire on his part to show more of who Grissom is, show more of his personal life?\n\n\"After the hiatus, you should get in touch with Billy, he will definitely have insights on that. When Naren Shankar, the co-showrunner, and I went to Billy and said we would like to do this, he got so excited. I think it felt natural for him. It felt natural for Grissom to be going to this place. And Billy enjoyed the idea of portraying a mature, adult relationship. It's not people falling into bed. It's real life. He was excited, excited down to, he picked the shirt he wore. Billy and Jorja were really excited about it. \n\n\"As writers and as fans &#8212; I almost can't look at the screen. I think Grissom is my Grissom, and I think we all feel that way. When Grissom almost kissed Lady Heather, I couldn't watch. The writers are very much in the same boat as the fans.\" \n\n*Can you clear one thing up &#8212; did Grissom actually sleep with Lady Heather? *\n\n\"I think it's for the fans to intuit what their relationship actually is. I can say, it's an ongoing debate among the writers. There are two camps &#8212; among everybody, cast, crew and everybody at &#8216;CSI.' There are those who believe that yes, they did sleep together, and there are people like me that believe that they had an intimate encounter of some kind, but it was not necessarily sexual. Billy may be of two minds about it himself. Listen, there certainly is a connection to Lady Heather, she is an intellect and a scholar in her own way. But we saw the dark side of that this season. But you would think he would have a very different connection with Sara. He can talk about bugs with Sara.\" \n\nHow romantic is that?\n\n\"I think for a forensic entomologist, it is!\"\n\n*So next year you guys are going up against \"Grey's Anatomy\"? What are your thoughts on that? *\n\n\"We have been through this once before, when Les Moonves [head of CBS] moved us from Friday to Thursday. Anthony Zuiker and Jerry Bruckheimer and Billy were like, &#8216;Bring it on.' I was a little concerned, but I learned from that. I learned that two great shows can coexist on a night. There is enough audience. I believe that it's a lot of competition for us, it makes next season very exciting for us. It's a great show. I don't know what's going to happen but I do think we can both coexist on that night. And we're going to do our best to deliver the best season ever.\" \n\n*We've been talking about the fact that there has been more about character's personal lives in the last season or two of \"CSI\" &#8212; is that in any way a response to the success of shows like \"Grey's\"? *\n\n\"No. Our response on &#8216;CSI' is never to external events. I think a show starts to struggle when it's reactive to external events, as opposed to growing and evolving from what is happening organically in the show. \n\n\"The writers and actors are very collaborative on our show, and it is a testament to their acting that they are able to pick up a fiber, swab a blood sample and make it look so interesting and engage our viewers. It was really to allow our actors, who are such great actors, to do a little more. A chance to... I don't want to say exercise their chops... It was a request. It was something that was obviously very important to our actors. As the show grew and we went on season by season... I think that we've focused a little more, in small doses, on [the question], who are these people that we see every Thursday night? We've always tried to do it in an organic fashion and never have it substitute [for the mysteries].\" \n\n\"[A good example is] Sarah Goldfinger's &#8216;Rashomama' &#8212;&nbsp; you got to have fun with our characters, but it was such an engaging mystery. And that is what we try to do. \n\n\"We have never ever responded to external events and I hope we don't, because I do believe that's when I believe great shows stumble &#8212; when they allow external pressures to direct the storylines. Of course, if I read about something in the newspaper, that doesn't stop us from being inspired by things that happen in the world. But I'm just saying, increased competition, shows are serialized, soap operas are back in fashion - I have never believed that that works [following the trend] and that's something we've never done on &#8216;CSI.' \n\n\"As a fan, I want to know a little more about them. I think we've done very effective stories revealing Catherine's backstory and tying her to Vegas. And that has been a theme throughout the season, Old Vegas and New Vegas. \n\n\"But Grissom has always been a very private person and this is an instance where we allow the fans to look through a window into a private moment.\" \n\n*Would it be fair to characterize what you're saying as &#8212; it's the natural evolution of the show and it's the desire of the actors to have that different flavor of those personal scenes to play? *\n\n\"It is. I think it would surprise the fans to know the many conversations and the days we spend talking about the characters on &#8216;CSI.' We especially do it at the beginning of every season and at the end of every season. You can't write a show unless you talk about who these people are and what makes them tick. We don't always show what makes them tick, but when a situation presents itself, when a story lends itself to that, it's exciting for both the writers and the actors to have a little blip of the private person. \n\n\"There is a delicate balance on &#8216;CSI' always, between the personal and the case. We try to keep that balance. I think the fans would say maybe we go a little to one side, maybe to the other side. But I do think an episode like &#8216;Rashomama,' the fans liked it. We got to see what our characters thought about marriage. There is a place for character development on &#8216;CSI,' we always have to handle it carefully. \n\n\"Sometimes maybe the writers tend to go overboard, but [between the writers and the actors, etc] it's like the checks and balances of government. \n\nThere was a huge response on my Web site and on many others regarding the finale. Have you been experiencing that, have you heard or read the feedback from fans?\n\n\"Like anybody else, I go on certain Web sites, and there were lots of e-mails, and from talking to [&#8216;CSI' writer] David Rambo - the fans got his e-mail, and so he has received quite a lot of pro and con mail. And from CBS, I've heard there's been quite an outpouring. Going into the seventh season, I love the fact that everybody cares about our show.\"\n\n",

The show has two spin-off series, and is set to return for its seventh year in the US in September.\n\nDid you think the show would become such a huge hit?\n\nWhen I read the script for CSI, it was like a trance I fell under. I became completely mesmerized by the idea of it but I didn't think it was going to be successful. It was about death and Americans are kind of weird about death. But I thought it was so interesting because it was a secret world that people hadn't got the chance to see very well. The bad thing about it, I think, is a lot of people expect their stolen wallets and stuff to be found in about 42 minutes and they get really irritated with the police when they don't.\n\nYou were in the bizzare position of being sacked and then suddenly rehired two season ago...\n\nWhen i was fired for a few hours I thought it was kind of a joke but after I had been fired for about four or five days, I started accepting that maybe I really had been fired. Then I was invited back. I think I feel a little bit less safe about anything to do with that show but that's probably a good thing because change is inevitable. It left a strange situation in which half the cast was working with a raise and half the cast was not. And that's not necessarily good for anybody.\n\nBilly Petersen has spoken out against the \"CSI\" spin offs, what do you think?\n\nI would have wished that there weren't any spin offs of CSI. But I think that all the shows have been able to sort of find their own legs. Emily Proctor from CSI: Miami is a friend of mind so I was really happy for her. She was on The West Wing at the same time as me so she did call me before she took the role and said, \"What do you think?\".\n\nYou're from New York, how well do you think \"CSI: New York\" is portraying the city?\n\nI think that they're doing a beautiful job showing the city. I think visually the show is stunning and there's sort of a blue dark grayness that I think is very appropriate for New York. Since 9/11 New York's economy has been struggling so I'm glad they chose to set it there, I'm all for bringing business to New York.\n\nWould you continue with \"CSI\"?\n\nI love my job. I've finished my tenth consecutive year on network television in the States and that's a really, really good run for anybody. I have dreams but I'll stay with the show and even if it goes away I've been very lucky.\n\nDo the special effects make you squeamish at all?\n\nI think the special effects guys try to gross me out. There was one scene this year where Greg and Sara found liquefied bodies in a car and he gets a gob of one of them on his face. I had to go out of the room.\n\nDo you think Sara and Grissom will ever get together?\n\nTheir storyline is not over, it will get revisited. Because I'm a romantic at heart I would like to see something.\n\n",

        "content": "\nCSI's *sexiest vegetarian on snatching (fake) bodies, carrying a torch for Grissom and the show's all-star band.*\n\nDuring her six years as a Las Vegas CSI, your character Sara Sidle's life has been anything but idle. Was it tough becoming a walking tabloid? A couple seasons back, she was almost blown up. She got a DUI. Her boyfriend dumped her. Grissom [William Petersen] sort of dumped her. She had authority issues and I was wondering if she was always going to have them. I felt like an emotional punching bag.\n\nSo is she going to get knocked around more anytime soon? This week, she helpes out when a burned body shows up in a chimney, but her personal dramas seem to have cooled. Going into this season, I wanted her to lighten up a little bit. So far, so good. It's the first season in a while where I'm able to smile and wink.\n\nWeren't Sara and Grissom supposed to have had something to smile about earlier this season? Episode 5 had us in a hotel room in bed together. It was really surprising. But that episode evolved into one with Nick [George Eads] solving a big case [because Petersen was unavailable when it filmed].\n\nDo you think you'll ever get back to that scene? The Grissom and Sara story line is not over. It will get revisited. I'm inclined to think it will be this year. Because I'm a romantic at heart, I'd like to see somethign. From time to time, I get asked by fans when Sara and Grissom are going to do it.\n\nWhat else do you hear from the fans? People offer up story ideas all the time. Sometimes they can give me the creeps. When a stranger comes up and talks to you about a murder, you're like, \"OK. Thanks.\"\n\nThe episodes are pretty creepy already. Do you ever get queasy around all the dead bodies? I think the special-effects guys are trying to gross me out. It's a game for them. One of the grossest episodes was this season when Greg [Eric Szmanda] and Sara found liquified bodies in a car and he got gobs of one of them on his face. I had to leave the room. There was another one a couple years ago where a guy gets hit by a car, impaled and left in a garage for two or three days. That's the one where I came closest to losing my dinner.\n\nNo wonder you and Sara are both vegetarians. I've been one for a long time. Right around Season 2, we had a story line where Grissom and Sara watch a pig decompose. I had said we should definitely use a fake pig, not a real one. And I made sure that Sara became a vegetarian.\n\nAre there any pluses to working on a show with lots of corpses? We have attempted to steal the fake bodies for the carpool lane. Do I have a carpool-lake fake friend? I don't. I won't say who, but someone who was late for a particular event took one. We don't encourange this sort of behavior. I want to be on the record with that.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not working on the show? I've had a theater company for seven or eight years. A group of us produced a musical last year. It's called \"Dear Bernard,\" [and it's] about a woman from a small town in England who moves to American to try and make it as a star. We're taking the show to London in June.\n\nWill you be in it? I wish I had the talent to do musical theater. I'd put together a band and go on the road. We do have a lunchtime jam band on the CSI set, though. Lots of crew people are in it. Gary Dourdan [Warrick] plays a mean guitar and bass. Robert David Hall [Dr. Robbins] plays guitar. Marg Helgenberger [Catherine] plays piano.\n\nIs any of this jamming going to show up on *CSI*? I have been pushing an all-musical CSI episode for five years. Grissom is in the lab and some chemical affects him badly and so this whole thing takes place in his head. While he's delirious, the show becomes a musical. Everybody would have to sing. Quite probably it would be the last episode ever.\n\n",

        "content": "\nQuestion: Hey, Matt! I love your column and just wanted to say, as a sci-fi fan, I appreciate all the attention you give to those great yet underappreciated shows. Now to my question. What are your thoughts on TV's growing trend of hooking up every character on a show with each other? I'll use CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as an example because of the fuss the season finale created. The show was great because it focused on the stories and not the characters. Now Grissom and Sara hook up, and it looks like Catherine and Warwick are on their way next season. What's next? Will Greg and Nick suddenly come out of the closet? Samantha on Without a Trace has slept with two guys from her office (one of whom was her boss) and everybody has slept with everybody on Grey's Anatomy. I know we like a little romance in our shows, but enough is enough. It is possible to have a relationship with someone outside the office?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah\n\nMatt Roush: Call it the NYPD Blue syndrome. (On that show, any time a new character was introduced into the precinct, it was like&nbsp;he or she&nbsp;had a \"fresh meat\" sign hanging around&nbsp;his/her neck.) Despite that startling moment at the end of the last CSI episode, which has stimulated plenty of reaction (see below), I doubt seriously that CSI is about to become a relationship drama. There has always been subtext about the characters' attraction to each other, and in this workplace genre, there tends to be a bit of romantic tension on nearly every show - if only because the characters seem to live at work, and it's a way to bring a little emotional suspense into the daily grind. I'm a&nbsp;bit more worried about the imbalance on Trace, which initially was quite adept at presenting personal story lines in between the cases of the week. With Jack's lady friend now pregnant, that troubles me. But Grey's Anatomy is an entirely different beast. It's a flat-out romance set in a hospital. That was apparent from the opening scene of the pilot, and whether you like it or not, that's the show. To me, it works beautifully. It's messier for shows that aren't inherently soap-operatic to play with these relationship story lines, and some should probably stay away from it as much as possible. As for the reaction to Gil-and-Sara on CSI, here are two delayed responses that arrived within an hour of each other last week.\n\nQuestion: I think it was about time GG and SS got together. I love the way it was done without any fanfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Margie\n\nMatt Roush: There is that to be said for it. Whether you agree with this pairing or not (usually not, according to my mailbag), the way it was presented was unexpected, to say the least. And here, from Lois C., is the sort of mail I usually get on the topic: \"I think it was disgusting to put Grissom and Sara together as a couple. There is no chemistry. If my best friend were in the hospital, there's no way I would have been off with some bimbo; I would be right at my best friend's side. If it didn't work on CSI: Miami, why&nbsp;would it work on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation? They killed off Horatio Caine's wife five minutes after they got married, and they should end the romance on CSI, or this lady here will never watch it again. I never liked Sara anyway, because she is such a geek, with absolutely no personality.\" \n\nHow do you really feel, Lois? And how exactly does a geek with no personality also qualify as some bimbo? Rather unfair, no? But again, I'll believe CSI has gone for friskiness over forensics when I see it. (And I hope I don't.)\n\n",

For the occasion of \"CSI**s Season 7 premiere (tonight at 9 pm/ET), TV Guide brought your burning questions, collected at TVGuide.com,&nbsp;to series stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox. In addition to what follows, look for many more Q's and A's in the new TV Guide magazine. \n\nQuestion: Are you surprised that a show that is not knownfor its romantic plots is now getting such a huge reaction for one scene at the end of one episode?  \n  \n*Fox: *Very surprised. It's a huge compliment to the show. There's this sense that the folks who have been watching loyally for so long are still really invested in what's happening to the characters. I know there are&nbsp;positive \"and\" negative responses, but it's nice to be causing a strong, emotional response.  \n  \n*Petersen: *We held back on any of that kind of stuff for six years for a reason. If you were going to do something like this a couple of years ago, where would we be now? Probably divorced. \n\n[...]\n\nQuestion: We know Mr. Petersen will be away for a couple of weeks this season [performing in a play in Providence, Rhode Island]. Do you think Sara will be true to Grissom while he's away?  \n  \n*Petersen: *I would like to think she would. It's only for a couple of weeks. We're still working on how that's going to unfold.  \n  \n*Fox: *I don't know if they even have a monogamous relationship. I'm not sure we've defined that. It's possible Sara would be true to him, but I wouldn't say it's definite. \n\n[...]\n\nQuestion: Knowing that eventually the administration will find out about the relationship, what consequences do you think will be in store for them career-wise? And if they were told to choose between their relationship and their jobs, what do you think they would do?  \n  \n*Petersen: *I don't know that Grissom has ever been in love, or that he's in love now, so I wouldn't know how to answer that question.  \n  \n*Fox: *Sara, by virtue of being a realist, is also very much a romantic. So I think if she really was in love with someone, and it came down to a choice between work and love, I think she'd go in the direction of love.\n\nQuestion: If you do not already know, which character do you think will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara's hidden romance?  \n  \n*Fox: *I don't really know how to answer that one.  \n  \n*Petersen: *People call this show a procedural, but it's a procedural that has characters the audience has come to know. As actors, there's a fine line to balance between the show you're doing and what you might like to do with your character. Go too far and it becomes a soap opera, and that's something we won't let happen. That's why the scene at the end of last season was so subtle. It was one camera move, a&nbsp;little conversation. There were people who wanted us to be in bed talking but that was not something we wanted to do. That's not Grissom and Sidle. I don't think they have any idea where their relationship is going. They haven't been able to go to a restaurant together, they can't go out and have a date, because everyone in the place would know us.... The show is about solving puzzles, to solve things and figure out things. And that's what this is:&nbsp;a puzzle to us and to the audience.  \n  \n*Fox: *But part of the fun of a puzzle is at least thinking that&nbsp;at some point you'll figure something out. The show does that well.  \n  \n*Petersen: *There were all kinds of [hints] over the years &#8212; people saw they were flirting &#8212; but that was just between Jorja and I. There were never other people in the scene getting these little tidbits, but the audience got them and was confused by them. Do they like each other? Do they not like each other? Are they doing it, are they not doing it? There was a time, years ago, where they said, \"We've flirted around with Grissom and Sara, but it's time for us to stop. This will be a moment, a big moment, and it'll be over.\" We said, \"That's foolish. We have great chemistry together. We enjoy the banter they have. We enjoy the subtext of all that. Why end it just because you don't know where it's going to go? Allow us to play whatever it may be, and who knows?\" So now we've ended up with this. Had we done what they talked about, we wouldn't be where we are now. If you give it all away, you can't go anywhere from there. It's like \"Lost\"&nbsp;&#8212; you have a big scene one week, and you're dead the next. \n\nQuestion: Jorja, Sara's character used to lean on Nick in the earlier seasons. What kind of relationship would you like to see for them in the upcoming season?  \n  \n*Fox: *I hope that George [Eads] and I get to work together a lot this year. We have a great familiarity and a great sense of humor when we're together.  \n  \n*Petersen: *Sometimes we go through many episodes without working with some of the guys. It's just the way the story lines evolve. [In] the beginning, we were all together on everything, but now they can do whole stories with just one or two of us.\n\nQuestion: The chemistry between the entire group, in my opinion, seems to be changing. I've noticed the strong bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why do you think that's happening?  \n  \n*Petersen: *There is less of a camaraderie than there was.  \n  \n*Fox: *You think so?  \n  \n*Petersen: *Part of it is because of the growth of the characters. In the beginning, everyone was struggling to do the job right. Now they've all grown and become very good at it, and there's less opportunity for the chemistry to play. It's&nbsp;like the first few days on a championship baseball team [where] they all have fun in the locker room, they all have fun in the bars. It's a very serious tone on the show, too. The tone has changed over time.  \n  \n*Fox: *I don't know if I agree. [The episode] \"Grave Danger\" brought everyone back together.  \n  \n*Petersen: *I'm not saying anything about the chemistry &#8212; it's still there &#8212; there's just not as much opportunity to play it. We used to always go into the DNA lab and have fun with Greg. Well, Greg isn't in the lab anymore; he's out in the field, going through all kinds of trials, so he isn't the same fun, happy-go-lucky Greg. George has had a terrible trauma so he's no longer punching Warrick in the shoulder, going, \"Hey, I bet I can do this better than you can.\" They're not kids anymore. It's like life in that way.\n\nQuestion: What has been your favorite episode to film?  \n  \n*Petersen: *Certainly the Quentin Tarantino episode [\"Grave Danger\"] was great. That was a full two hours, a big job for everybody.  \n  \n*Fox: *I really liked \"A Bullet Runs Through It,\"\" \"Parts&nbsp;1 and 2. That was incredibly good.  \n  \n*Petersen: *The big ones create more memories for us. Sometimes we'll work on a show for&nbsp;eight or&nbsp;nine days, so to spend \"three weeks\" on the same story line is great for us. You feel like you were there because it was bigger.  \n  \n*Fox: *We have a two-parter coming at the start of the [new] season that feels like we have been shooting for three months.\n\nQuestion: Jorja, in his TV Guide interview, Eric Szmanda said that Greg hasn't give up on Sara yet. What do you think Sara's reaction will be once she learns about the deep feelings Greg has for her?  \n  \n*Fox: *That question intrigues me because Eric \"broke up with me\" in a magazine last summer. We were working a little tension on the show between Greg and Sara, when I read in a magazine that Eric was done with all that. I called him and said, \"If you want to break up with me, at least do it in person.\" It's so great to have your private relationships play out in the press.  \n  \n*Petersen: *Isn't that great? Now our characters are in the \"National Enquirer\".\n\n[...]\n\nQuestion: Jorja, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather? If so, how would Sara react to her and Grissom's past?  \n  \n*Fox: *It would be a fun scene to get to do. Sara sat out a lot of the Lady Heather stuff.  \n  \n*Petersen: *We had this scene where we talked about the guy with the corset damage. Sara asks Grissom where he got his information and he just said, \"I have my sources.\" To those who caught that, they'll think he must have learned what he knew from Lady Heather. He doesn't talk to Sara about Lady Heather or his infatuation any more than any guy would discuss his infatuation with another woman while talking to his woman.  \n  \n*Fox: *Grissom is good at keeping secrets.\n\nQuestion: If \"CSI\" is allowed to go for six \"more\" years, what would you like, or not like, to see happen?  \n  \n*Petersen: *How we'd raise our 5-year-old baby. [\"Fox laughs\"] Less death, I guess. More robberies, fewer murders.  \n  \n*Fox: *I'm determined that when I see gray hair on Eric Szmanda's head, I'm leaving. I'm done.  \n  \n*Petersen: *I don't think we can even afford to think like that. When we started, we were on Friday nights at 9 o'clock and were just hoping we'd see Christmas. We get the scripts two days before we shoot them, so it's pretty hard to think what we'd like to do next year.  \n  \n*Fox: *I will say thanks to the [question] writer for saying that there will be six more years for us.  \n  \n*Petersen: *When you're first building something, you're fearless because every moment is desperate. Every moment could be your last. When you achieve success over time, you can't live like that anymore, and you don't have to. But then you have to figure out how to stay sharp, and that becomes a very tricky dance.  \n  \n*Fox: *Every year that we're lucky enough to be on, the statistics make it seem more likely that it'll be our last. But I think we're bringing our game face this year. \n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "\nYou wanted answers about Grissom and Sara's relationship. We got 'em!\n\nWilliam Petersen \"and\" Jorja Fox \"tell all about CSI's biggest mystery yet\"\n\nLas Vegas. Sin City. The night was black as an oil patch left by a perp's getaway car, but the neon lights of the Strip cast a glow on the town tlike a rainbow on a bender. That's when we saw them ... Grissom and Sidle, two CSIs who had no business being in a bedrobe together. The dame wore a robe, like she'd just stepped out of the shower. And Grissom ... her boss ... lay on the bed, talking about death.\n\nTurns out relationships that happen in Vegas don't always stay in Vegas. Here's the evidence: In the last scene of \"CSI\"'s May season finale, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) shocked viewers with their romantic rendezvous. Fan Web sites went nuts. TV GUIDE got lots of letters &#8212; some people liked the relationship; others wanted to send the storyline on a slow boat to China. We had to know: What were the producers thinking?\n\nExec producer Carol Mendelsohn came clean. This promises to be the most personal season of \"CSI\" yet. Good thing, too, since it's now going up against TV's sudsiest smash, \"Grey's Anatomy\". \"The bones of Season 7 will be the toll the job has on our CSIs,\" she says. \"The sin in Sin City is beginning to wear on them.\"\n\nNext we talked to exec producers Naren Shankar: \"We're not going to turn into a soap opera, but we're going to see their anger with the world, and them reaching out to each other.\"\n\nThen they really sang like canaries: Turns out \"all\" the CSIs will get roughed up this season, in one way or another.\n\n[...]\n\nThat's what we got. Now it's your turn. TV GUIDE sat down with Petersen and Fox to ask the \"your\" questions (collected on tvguide.com) about all that's happened and what's still to come on \"CSI\".\n\nDoes the fan response to this new relationship shock you?  \n  \nWilliam Petersen: We knew there was a shock value to it because of the little bits and moments that Sara and Grissom have had over the years. So to see them together that way would have impact in terms of, \"Whoa, there they are!\"  \n  \nJorja Fox: I like the mystery of it. It left so many more questions than it really answered. And I think we're all going to figure that out as we go into this season. Billy and I aren't necessarily that far ahead of the audience with this one.\n\nHow long have Grissom and Sara been seeing each other?  \n  \nFox: We may find out more about that from time to time.\n\nWhy do you think Grissom so coldly said no to a relationship in earlier seasons but decided to accept it now?  \n  \nPetersen: Obviously, this relationship is fraught with danger for Grissom. He and Sara have a mentor-protegee relationship and it'd be difficult for anyone in that situation. What one might say one day might not necessarily be how one feels. And what one ends up doing may not be what one thought he or she would be doing.\n\nPlease, please, can we have a kiss before all is said and done?  \n  \nPetersen: \"[Laughing]\" I'd like to think we could. We'd love to kiss but the network would have to cough up some more money for that. Tongue would cost more. Sometimes they pay you for things that are fun.\n\nMr. Petersen, what were you thinking when you chose to wear that aloha shirt in the Season 6 finale? Did the thought of being shirtless ever cross your mind?  \n  \nPetersen: Regarding being shirtless, it never crossed my mind. That aloha shirt has a history. I got it in the Philippines 10 years ago off a guy's back. I traded him shirts in the jungle. For Grissom, it was something different. This is how he lets his hair down when he's with someone he trusts.  \n  \nFox: Sure, Sara loves Grissom in the buff. But I don't think that was what the scene was about. One of my favorite things was Grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters. And maybe they go home after the things they've seen and have some tenderness of their own.\n\nWhich character will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara's hidden romance?  \n  \nPetersen: Sara and Grissom are not going to let people find out, which makes it even more intense. I don't know who would find out first or how they'd react. I do know there are several actors dying to be the one who finds out. \"[Laughs]\" Paul Guilfoyle has already gone to the writers saying, \"I'm the one who knows!\"\n\nThe chemistry between the entire group seems to be changing ... the bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why?  \nFox: I'm sorry the writer feels that way. The writer will be happy to find out there's some Warrick and Nick stuff coming up early in this season.\n\nMiss Fox, you play Sara so well, I wonder if you are like her?  \n  \nFox: I am probably more like her than any other character I've played, which is lucky considering that this has been going on for six years. Billy swears that he's acting like Grissom, and that must be exhausting for you \"[Petersen laughs]\". I do like her a lot. She's much smarter than I am. But I also like to focus on one thing for a while. We have OCD in common. I'm very idealistic, like Sara.\n\n[...]\n\nDo you think Lady Heather is Grissom's soul mate?  \n  \nPetersen: I think she's his spanking partner. Every now and then a guy needs a good spanking. Lady Heather could teach this country a lot. How to dress.  \n  \nFox: Definitely how to dress.\n\nMiss Fox, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather?  \n  \nFox: It would be great if Lady Heather and Sara met. It would be a fun scene to do. When we go places that are sensual, sexual or a bit exotic or scandalous, Sara's never there. She's at the car-wash murder across town \"[laughs]\". So it is a pet peeve of mine that these episodes get written and I'm miles away. And I wonder if that's partially control on Grissom's part, since he hands out the cases.\n\nNow that you'll be going up against \"Grey's Anatomy\", will you be adding more story lines about the personal relationships on the show to attract some of the \"Grey's Anatomy\" fans?  \n  \nFox: I wish them well. It's a great show and a lot of wonderful people are involved.\n\n[...]\n\nFor more fan questions answered by William Petersen and Jorja Fox, go to tvguide.com/csi\n",

But last week, while I was interviewing fellow Sexiest Vegetarian nominee Jorja Fox, she hinted that something may in fact be happening. \"I can't give anything away, but we have a cliff-hanger at the end of this season that I think you guys are going to have a field day with,\" she teased. \"All I can say is it's going to be good. It's going to come completely out of left field. I think everyone's going to end Season 6 with their jaws dropped.\" Fox went on to say that there will be \"two cliff-hangers in the finale,\" one of which involves \\*** and the other... Sara-Grissom? \"I don't kiss and tell,\" Fox said. Short-story-short: Either my CSI mole lied to me or producers saw my spoiler rant on Square Off and decided to tack on some Sara-Grissom stuff at the last minute in my honor. I guess we'll find out on May 18.\n\n[...]\n\n",

No big deal, except the ad-which will be unveiled May 11 in LA-relies heavily on her CSI connection. Perhaps too heavily. \"I didn't really ask for permission, which I probably should have,\" confesses Fox, a longtime vegetarian. \"I didn't see that there was anything controversial, or even confrontational, about it. As far as PETA's concerned, its one of their gentler ads. We'll see. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble.\" One person who probably won't have a beef with the campaign is Fox's costar William Petersen. \"Billy has just become a vegetarian in the last couple of months,\" reveals the actress, who insists Petersen did not reject meat under pressure from her. \"He came to it very slowly on his own.

Spoilerphobes, read at your own risk!\n\nAusiello: Hi, Jorja.  \n  \n*Jorja: *Sorry I'm a few minutes late. My very good friend, Eric Szmanda, who plays Greg Sanders, just did his last scene of the season, so there was a good three minutes of hugging going on.\n\nAusiello: You won't see him now until July?  \n  \n*Jorja: *No, I'm probably going to see him tomorrow night. He and I are very close. Tomorrow is my wrap day, so I think we're gonna all go out tomorrow night and have drinks after work. He'll probably start drinking today; I'll be waiting until tomorrow.\n\nAusiello: What's going on in your final scene?  \n  \n*Jorja: *I can't give anything away, but we have a cliff-hanger at the end of this season that I think you guys are going to have a field day with. All I can say is that it's going to be good and it's going to come completely out of left field. I think everyone's going to end Season 6 with their jaws dropped. \n\nAusiello: Does it involve anything romantic between Sara and Grissom?  \n  \n*Jorja: *I don't kiss and tell. God bless that story line. It's been around since the first episode of Season 1, and Billy and I have known one thing and it's that we never really know when they're going to bring it out; it's always a surprise. So I'm not going to give away any details. All I can say is that I think this cliff-hanger will be quite surprising for everybody. If you're a fan of the show, don't miss it. \n\nAusiello: Does it involve \\* getting shot?  \n  \nJorja: **There are two cliff-hangers in the finale, one will involve \\***. There's a melding of cliff-hangers in the last episode, which is rare for our show. We don't do them that much. We don't do cliff-hangers per se, but sometimes we'll throw something really crazy into the mix right before the end of the year. \n\nAusiello: Most of my CSI mail is about Sara-Grissom. Fans want you two to get together.  \n  \n*Jorja: *No kidding? It's funny because Billy and I are always so sure that everyone's just bored to tears with that story line. We've been sort of beating that horse for six years. \n\nAusiello: Switching gears, you and I have something in common.  \n  \n*Jorja: *Really?\n\nAusiello: We're both nominated in PETA's World's Sexiest Vegetarian poll.  \n  \n*Jorja: *We are?\n\nAusiello: Yes. Have you voted yet?  \n  \n*Jorja: *No! I didn't even know about this at all. I'm so embarrassed. \n\nAusiello: If you go to GoVeg.com, you'll see it.  \n  \n*Jorja: *I'll vote for both of us, like, 20 times. Congratulations!\n\nAusiello: Congratulations to you, too. I think we can win.  \n  \n*Jorja: *If we vote continuously. When do the polls close?\n\nAusiello: In a few weeks.  \n  \n*Jorja: *Oh, wow. That's a lot of voting. \n\nAusiello: I don't know what we win.  \n  \n*Jorja: *Maybe it's a date with each other.\n\nAusiello: Maybe. We could go to a vegetarian restaurant.  \n  \nJorja: (Laughs) Totally!\n\nAusiello: You're featured in a new PETA campaign with the slogan \"Investigate Vegetarianism.\" How did that come about?  \n  \nJorja: I've been a member of PETA forever. I was very active when I lived in New York City, which I did for many years. They'd have protests and things of that nature, and I was very active in doing stuff like that. And just this year PETA moved to Los Angeles. They have an office in Silver Lake, which is totally exciting for those of us in L.A. And that's sort of how I got in contact with them. And so they approached me with the idea, and I jumped at the chance. \n\nAusiello: Did you get permission from CSI? The ad leans heavily on your connection to the show.  \n  \nJorja: To be honest, I didn't really ask for permission; I probably should have. I didn't see that there was anything controversial - or even confrontational - about the ad. I think that as far as PETA's concerned, it's one of their gentler ads. But we'll see. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble. But I somehow doubt it. It's a pretty supportive group around here.\n\nAusiello: Do you make your costars feel guilty about eating meat?  \n  \nJorja: That's rarely my style. Billy has just become a vegetarian in the last couple of months. \n\nAusiello: Due to your influence?  \n  \nJorja: No, his wife has been a vegetarian for a long time and I think it's just a combination of things. He's sort of been on a health kick anyway. And he loves animals. \n\nAusiello: What are you doing on your hiatus?  \n  \nJorja: I produced a play in L.A. two years ago called Dear Bernard. It's an original musical and we've been invited to take the show to London at Riverside Studios this summer. So that's my big summer project. We have a three-week run there. It's a risk, but it was a risk I couldn't pass up. \n\nAusiello: How long do you see yourself doing CSI?  \n  \nJorja: Sky's the limit. In about 24 hours I will have completed my 10th consecutive year on prime-time television, starting with ER in 1996. I thought to myself over the years that it would be really cool to do 10 years on TV, and now I'm about to hit that mark. So from this point on there's no script. It's unchartered territory.\n\nAusiello: But you'll be back in the fall, right?  \n  \nJorja: Yeah, I'll be back. I'm getting a little older and there are some other things that I'd like to do, so from time to time I think that maybe it's about time to move on and do something different. I'm not getting any younger. But I'm not ready to let this go.\n\n",

        "content": "\nHoly schnike! The nookie is confirmed! While seeing a shot of Sara in a robe coming over to our dear Gil in bed certainly was no great surprise, it still made my heart race. I was kind of hoping the long, drawn-out pan around the room and the true answer to \"GG + ?\" would lead us to something more shocking (like Brass' daughter, maybe), but I'm happy to see this ending as well. A good handful of readers have said they would never watch the show again if Grissom hooks up with Sara. I've got one thing to say to that: I'll be looking forward to your posts next season.\n\nNo matter how you feel about the show getting personal, if you are a CSI fan, you really had to enjoy this episode. From start to finish, this was a classic. Just the first two minutes had me totally jazzin' for the rest. Before I could finish my cheeseburger (well OK, so it was a double) Brass gets paddled and we see a body with no head. It was a creepy yet riveting opening sequence. Top that off with a third victim and you've got what made this show great in the first place &#8212; bodies!\n\nI relate in some weird way to that third guy who died of, well... sex, drugs, and rock and roll, I suppose. Music blastin' till 7 am, partying hard all night... I've always figured I was going to go out like that, too . except it would probably be sex with myself, Zocor and the latest Clay Aiken record. As long as I'm not found in my \"I'm Aiken for Clay\" T-shirt, I'll be sort of OK with that ending. I mean, who wants to die and have high cholesterol?\n\nThere were some really funny moments again in this one, too. When Dr. Robbins says the victim had sex in every orifice &#8212; the joke between him and Catherine was that he \"died with a smile on his face, among other things.\" I thought Grissom and Sara counting off the 10 steps and dueling with cameras was kind of cute as well. What's not cute? A man in a corset. Having lived near Gettysburg for part of my life, I've witnessed a war reenactment before and they are really cool to see, but you just know that somewhere in the slew of actors taking part, there's got to be one guy taking the whole thing a little too seriously. Sort of like our decapitated friend.\n\nFinally, how about those clues. Other than Gris, did anything else get addressed? If so, I missed them all. I got sucked into this photo frenzy last week for nothing. Well, except for the simple fact that I couldn't wait for this episode to begin. I suppose it served its purpose then.\n\nNo matter, it was an awesome ending to an up-and-down season. I'm looking forward to your comments expressing outrage over the last 10 seconds of the show, and I'll see you all in the fall when Season 7 begins.\n\n",

At first I thought he was talking to himself... which I wouldn't put past Gil. But then Sara walked out of the bathroom wearing a white silk bathrobe! When did these two start getting together? I know it's always been there, Sara having the giant crush on Grissom and all. That was let out of the bag a few seasons ago. Seems like they both finally realized that life is short.

At the end of this past season, viewers were left with an image of her character, Sara Sidle, trapped under a wrecked sports car in the middle of nowhere. Signs of life were, shall we say, limited. For \"CSI\" fans, the debate has been raging since before the finale ever aired about whether or not Sara would survive the crash. [...]\n\n[...]\n\nThe bigwigs at CBS are quick to point out that [Jessica] Lucas' character is a new edition, not a replacement for Jorja Fox. The question is, do we believe them? I for one, have my doubts. Sara might very well survive that car crash, but does that mean she'll stick around in Vegas? Who knows. I do know at least one thing for sure. The legions of femslash writers out there are likely to ignore Sara's death (if it happens) just as they have ignored her on screen romance with Grissom.\n\nAnd frankly, much as I enjoy Jorja Fox and the character of Sara Sidle, if the character's death would prevent me from having to see Sara and Gil making doe eyes at each other and getting all snugly, then so be it. I have not been able to properly watch an episode of \"CSI\" since Sara walked into Gil's bedroom in a bathrobe. The very last bedroom I wanted to see Sara walk into in a bathrobe is one with Gil Grissom waiting on the bed. Perhaps my own fascination with femslash has done something to my brain, but the idea of Grissom and Sara romancing one another disturbs me.

She's been there for seven years, she's made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing.\" \n\nOn the other hand Fox seems perfectly content and hasn't made any public rumblings about leaving. \n\nIn a recent interview Fox responded to queries about the cast in general. \"Yeah, as far as I know, everybody will be back.\" \n\nStill Fox's people and CBS are being extremely tight lipped. \n\nThis begs the question. Why so much ambiguity surrounding Fox's return? All indications point to a cliff hanger involving Fox. \n\nIn fact the Chicago Tribune reports that Sara will go missing in the season finale. This will force the super secret Grissom Sara relationship into the open. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that releasing Fox's contract negotiations would spoil the impact of the episode. \n\nWhile some message boards seems pleased by the idea of no Sara in Season 8 other fans are panicked by the idea that Fox might be done with the show. Still others are optimistic about any storyline that brings Sara Grissom out in the open. \n\n\"I'll admit I'm slightly concerned,\" said Grissom Sara shipper MsGrits. \"However, based on Jorja's attitude and the appeal of the Grissom and Sara relationship I'm hopeful that the season finale will have a positive impact on the ship in general. \n\nI believe that Grissom and Sara have contributed heavily to CSI's strength and viability in their sevent season. I don't think it would be pragmatic to just end that relationship now.\" \n\nThis season has seen Grissom both giddy about his lady love and completely freaked out the by uber creepy Miniature Killer. The psycho sociopath has sent Grissom life sized replicas of past, present and future crime scenes. One man confessed and and killed himself to boot. Of course nothing is resolved that easily in TV serial killer land or in contract negotiations. \n\nStay tunned. \n\nSources:  \n:http://popgurls.com/article_show.php3?id=661  \n:http://www.tvguide.com  \n:http://www.watchingcsi.com  \n:http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com",

Given the final moments, the title seems cruelly ironic.\n\nCBS has asked that I refrain from any potential spoilers. If the network were serious, it would have gagged both Fox and the \"CSI\" producers weeks ago. It's no secret that Fox's investigator Sara Sidle lives to see another day.\n\nAs to what kind of day she'll be waking up to, well, that's something viewers will be pondering for some time.\n\nIn Wednesday night's episode, Sara shows obvious signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of her recent kidnapping.\n\nAs a battered wife stands in her blood-spattered living room - with a knife stuck in her back - Sara uncharacteristically shows no concern.\n\nWhen Ronnie (Jessica Lucas) wants to intervene in the case of the brawling couple, Sara replies, \"We'll be back for her body next month. Or his. Or both.\"\n\nThe case of a co-ed pushed from her dorm room brings Sara back into contact with killer Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his pint-sized prodigy of a sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia). Marlon is a student at the college; Hannah is teaching and proves to be just as much a roadblock as she was the first time they crossed paths and helped Marlon escape justice. Sara is determined to right that wrong.\n\n\"You are not going to muddy the waters this time,\" Sara tells the twerp.\n\n\"Are you sure you'd know if I had?\" Hannah replies.\n\nHannah, improbably, seems to be the only one to realize Sara is imploding emotionally.\n\nAt a key moment late in the episode, Sara walks into the CSI offices and plants a kiss on Gil Grissom (William Petersen). It's a moment that will make devoted fans of the show squeal - until they realize, as Gil does, too late, that Sara is saying farewell.\n\nThe top-rated show about forensic detectives made the Sara/Grissom relationship the greatest mystery of the series. Viewers followed a faint trail of crumbs over the years that led to the reveal of their relationship. Sara's moments tonight with Grissom are, in the tradition of the series, short and maddeningly frustrating.\n\nFox decided not to renew her contract, but she deserved a better sendoff than this. The nature of her departure will stab at the hearts of viewers. But there remains a chance she could return.\n\nSomeday.  \n",

While both at times were shown in fleeting relationships with other people, it turns out now that they've been together for a while. Last year's season finale revealed their ongoing liaison to the viewers, though not to their co-workers.\n\nWilliam Petersen says that Grissom and Sara have \"been together for a while; it's just that no one knew it. It's an interesting thing to play and it's somewhat fraught with danger. In Grissom's mind, it's a secret affair. I don't think he knows what will happen.\"\n\nApparently their fellow CSIs aren't very astute investigators, if they haven't noticed the little clues to their evolved relationship that fans have this season, such as Grissom bringing dinner to Sara (and only Sara) while she and some of the other CSIs worked late one night, as well as a certain incident with an overly loud radio. Then again, Sara's always been a bit of a teacher's pet, so maybe they can be excused.\n\nThe next new episode, Empty Eyes, set to air March 29th, may change this, as the Sara-centric episode promises a final scene set at the lab that may reveal them to be more than just professional colleagues. Then again, William Petersen seemed to think just recently that the rest of the team isn't going to find out anytime soon.\n\n\"I think their relationship would be a disturbance to the rest of the team. It wouldn't be good for Grissom as he's a supervisor and it wouldn't be good for Sara who's a subordinate. They realise the conflict, which makes for interesting drama.\"",

After seven years of playing Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox is ready to exit the forensic drama and move on. But before she leaves, the 39-year-old actress will be portraying her character one last time, giving closure to the \"Grissom Sara Romance\" many fans have learned to adore, in tonight's episode entitled \"Goodbye and Good Luck.\"\n\n[...]\n\nIn the seventh episode of the season 8, a suspect from Sara's past comes back to hunt her, causing her to question her career as a \"CSI\". Not much has been revealed about Sara's last episode but according to \"TV Guide\", she leaves at night in a \"vehicle of some sort and that the episode ends with a close-up of a different character.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nI'll preface this by admitting that I was not a big Sara fan. I think I turned against Jorja Fox after the first contract dispute. To me, \"CSI\" is more of an ensemble show, so even though I have my favorites, \\cough\\ Warrick \\cough\\, I resented the impression I got that she thought she was more important than any of the others. Besides that, I kinda wanted Lady Heather to loosen Grissom up a bit. All that being said, I really felt for Sara tonight.\n\nI remember thinking that Sara got her comeuppance the last time she ran into Hannah. She had an air of superiority, that know-it-all aura that really bugged me. This time, and it may have been because of her recent experiences, I saw a vulnerability in her. The writers did a good job of letting us go along for the final ride of Sara Sidle: CSI.\n\nFrom the beginning of the episode when she was talking with Warrick about not sleeping, we saw a tired Sara. Not just a physically tired Sara, but emotionally tired. The first case, where she disassociated herself, was also another sign. Her final interactions with Hannah and her brother were a perfect way to say goodbye. Brandon was the one that got away and it was because Hannah played her.\n\nShe was determined to get them this time, and once she got Brandon, her determination to get Hannah was quite tangible. It was so important to her. But once Brandon committed suicide, her chance at Hannah was gone, legally at least. Making that little girl cry was one thing, but when her new teammate basically made her feel like crap, that was something different. She was losing her humanity, and she knew it.\n\nThat goodbye letter to Grissom almost had me in tears. It was beautifully done. Watching him read it, hearing her read it, and watching her leave in the taxi was a very fitting end to the episode, and a fitting end to Grissom and Sara. Although the letter ending was quite final, there's that little possibility that at some point she'll return.\n\nBefore watching \"CSI\" tonight, I was ready to say good riddance to bad rubbish. This episode made me say \"Fare thee well, Sara\". \n\n",

        "content": "\nThough Sara Sidle has already left \"CSI\", fans of the forensic drama are still determined to convey their support to her portrayer, Jorja Fox.\n\nPreviously, fans combined their efforts to come up with a \"Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign\" to prevent the 39-year-old actress from leaving the show. When Fox officially exited the CBS series, the excess money raised by the crusade was donated to charity. And now that the campaign is over, a new drive is being created that aims to thank the former \"CSI\" actress.\n\n\"Thanking Jorja\" is the latest gesture of gratitude instigated by the Fox's fans. Instead of sending messages to CBS about Fox leaving \"CSI\", her supporters are now participating in a letter-writing campaign that invites fans to send stories and photos to be included in a scrapbook for the actress. The project also encourages fans to share stories about how they came to know Fox, how she has inspired their lives, their favorite \"CSI\" episode she was in, and other stories that express their appreciation for the actress.\n\nFox, who left the show after seven yeas of playing the forensic scientist, is presently enjoying her break from the commitment of a weekly television series but also fears that quitting the hit series might be \"the biggest mistake of her life.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about leaving for a year and a half. I had to get up the courage. Maybe I'm just having a midlife crisis. Maybe this will be the worst decision I ever make,\" Fox told the New York Post.\n\n\"Theater is one of my loves, so I'm open for that after 11 and a half years of working in primetime TV for \"ER\", \"The West Wing\" and \"CSI\". I've never been to college, and I think about that. But I kept putting it off, and I am also thinking about having a child, and that's really important. Also, I want to do a lot of traveling and surfing - two of my hobbies. I have a one-woman little play about Dusty Springfield opening February 2 at the Renberg Theater in Hollywood,\" Fox added.\n\n",

        "content": "\nAlthough many deem the Grissom-Sara love affair to be a significant contributing factor for the intriguing yet forced plot of the show, the couple's fans might need to say goodbye to their on screen romance. Although it hasn't been confirmed or denied by CBS, many speculate that Jorja Fox, actress who plays Sara Sidle on Crime Scene Investigation, will be leaving the Emmy Award-winning CBS television series. According to TV Guide, Fox's contract is up to next month and that she may not renew for the next season. \n\n\"Her leaving makes perfect sense. She's been there for seven years, she's made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing,\" a source close to the show told TV Guide.\n\nFox, a 38-year old native of New York, attended Melbourne High School. Prior to her inclusion on Crime Scene Investigation, she appeared in movies like \"Velocity Trap\", \"Food for the Heart\" and on television shows like \"The West Wing\" and \"ER\". \n\nFox's exit on the show hints on a cliffhanger although it remains to be ambiguous at this point. According to the Chicago Tribune, the nightshift CSI level 3 materials and elements analyst will go missing in CSI's season finale, which will be aired on Thursday, May 17. The remaining three episodes will show Grissom as he focuses his attention on both his love and his Miniature Killer. Others speculate that this will also force open the secret relationship of Sara and Gil Grissom, played by William Petersen. In line with this, CBS remains to be silent about the news, as it will spoil the impact of the episode. \n\nWhether the buzz is true or not, fans will just have to wait and see. Stay glued to CSI, every Thursday at 9 PM ET/PT on CBS. \n",

Now more possible details have emerged â but are they true? You be the judge. \n\nBeware of possible spoilers for the upcoming season finale, set to air May 17.\n\nPreviously it was reported that her character was set to go missing, but this week the New York Post reported that her character was slated to die in a car accident because of Jorja Fox's ongoing contract dispute with the show. According to the Post, Jorja Fox's representative told them that Fox's \"contract is up and [Fox and CBS] are in conversations.\"\n\nReportedly Fox simply didn't show up to shoot the scenes for the finale as a gesture of protest over her salary dispute, forcing the show to shoot an \"alternate ending\" for the episode. This apparently cost CBS quite a lot of money, between script re-writes, filming costs, and flying Fox's co-star Marg Helgenberger back to Las Vegas to re-shoot the alternate scenes. Jorja Fox's representative claims that she did show up on set to shoot her scenes, however, so it's uncertain whether these reports are accurate. \n\nWill Sara Sidle be back next season or not? Will the Grissom:-and-Sara romance be revealed to their co-workers? I guess we'll have to wait and see. \n\nIt's not the first time Jorja Fox has been involved in a contract dispute with CBS over the show; in fact, three years ago she and George Eads (CSI's Nick Stokes) were actually fired after they refused to show up for work without a raise. Fox was making over $100 000 per episode of CSI, and that she was demanding a \"major raise.\" to which CBS and the CSI producers reportedly offered her a \"moderate raise,\" but she turned it down. However, they were hired back within a couple of days.",

But since landing the role of the forensic entomologist, he has developed a keen interest in the field and has seen some surprising changes in his personality.\n\n\"I was terrible in school at science,\" he told WOWOW. \"He was so different than me, and so it was interesting for me to be able to try and do something that I was not familiar with. Since then, I've become very attracted to science, so it was a good thing for me.\"\n\n\"I don't kill insects anymore,\" he added. \"I used to swat flies and my wife used to make me chase the spiders. I have a whole backyard full of spiders now, webs everywhere. They're just crawling around the house.\"\n\nMoreover, he describes his character as someone \"very in touch with his childhood,\" which gives him a unique perspective on reality and what he does for a living.\n\n\"[H]is imagination and his creativity led him into science, so for him science is like playing childhood games and I think that that's always a big part of how he views his work. For him, it's all just wonder, you know, and he doesn't allow himself to become too adult about it... [otherwise] it would be too difficult for him to do it because it's all tragedy, and there's so much violence and inequity.\"\n\nFor Fox, 39, she says her character, as well as Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) are strong and professional women, which is one of the reasons why she feels lucky to portray the forensic scientist.\n\n\"They're completely intellectual and at the same time they feel very real. They feel like real people to me. It feels like a person that somebody could actually be,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, people involved with \"CSI\" are still being tight-lipped about whether Fox's character, Sara, will live or die. Season 7 has left viewers with Sara's life hanging in the balance, trapped beneath a car somewhere in the desert. According to executive producer Naren Shankar, the upcoming season's premiere episode \"Dead Doll\" will finally give a satisfying resolution to last season's cliffhanger.\n\n\"Let's just say fans will be very satisfied with how it turns out,\" he said. \"No loose ends will be left dangling at the end of the first episode.\"\n\n\"CSI\" returns on Thursday, September 27 on CBS.",

While the season premiere answered that question, the resolution was overshadowed by word that despite surviving, Sara is still not long for the CSI world ... because Jorja Fox, the actress who plays her, will be leaving \"CSI\".\n\nAlthough it hasn't been definitively confirmed, multiple sources have said that she will be leaving the show this November, after failing to arrive at a resolution for a new contract. Fox herself was relatively cagey in response to questions about the matter, but did recently provide some insight into the plans for her character.\n\nHer final show is said to air November 9, in an episode titled \"Hello Goodbye.\" While Fox's ability to give details is limited since she is still under contract, she does give a few teasers as to how the relationship between Sara and Grissom will develop during these last few episodes with her.\n\nShe told \"TV Guide\", \"There's going to be a wealth of information that we're going to find out about Sara and Grissom in season 8. We shot five episodes so far, and I think it's going to be a really exciting, interesting season. The writers have done a phenomenal job. There have been so many twists and turns already, and little bombs that we've dropped, I'm already blown away. I'm like, &#8216;Where's this going? We're only in episode 5.'\"\n\n\"CSI\" producers have said that their story would conclude this season, but Jorja Fox doesn't exactly agree. She said, \"I can't contradict what one of our producers said, but I can only tell you from my experience, I don't think you're going to get that. This might sound vain, but the story of Sara and Grissom is a little like a fable. And most great fables don't really have 100 percent resolution.\"\n\nIt sounds as though her departure is a done deal, but she was also fired from and rehired to the show in 2004, so who knows? Maybe there is a chance that Sara Sidle will also escape from this untimely departure from the \"CSI\" world.",

Flyers have already been sent from 39 countries, while an online petition called \"Keep Jorja Fox on \"CSI\",\" has already obtained more than 2,100 signatures. Fans are also trying to raise money through the \"Keep Jorja Fox on CSI\" campaign which has already sent 100 balloons to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn at the \"CSI\" offices along with cards that said, \"Don't Burst Our Bubble!

But before she leaves, she'll be playing Sara one last time in the episode fittingly called \"Goodbye and Good Luck,\" which airs on Thursday, November 15.\n\nIn line with her controversial departure, Fox spoke to the official \"CSI Magazine\" about her character's exit. She explained that she opted to have Sara leave in this manner, rather than have her die at the hands of the miniature serial killer in \"Dead Doll.\"\n\n\"I did not want Sara to die,\" she said. \"I did not want that to be the way she went out.

In 2004, she got caught up in a controversy when she was reportedly fired from the forensic drama for allegedly failing to submit a letter to CBS for confirming that she would be on time for shooting.

Fox left the show a few weeks ago, and she took away her character, Sara Sidle. But don't expect \"CSI\" to suffer much because, duh, the true star of America's No. 1 drama is its sci-fi special effects.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd Fox &#8212; who was named the 80th sexiest woman in the world by Stuff magazine in 2003 &#8212; was great in her best moments. But she too was just a cog in the wheel of an ensemble show that (like \"Law & Order\") barely notices its detectives have personal lives, including Sara's long affair with Grissom.\n\n[...]\n\nThis expensive style is taken for granted, since it's changed the style of the TV procedural. But it's really quite extraordinary. Several weeks ago, a guy was decapitated while racing a go-cart behind an 18-wheeler on a road. But you didn't see the decapitation.\n\nInstead, the scene opened with a head in a helmet bouncing down the road, as the camera perspective swirled around it and the \"Blue Danube\" waltz toyed to the rhythm of the bounces.\n\nThis was played neither for drama nor for comedy. It was just a dash of commercial art, a form of art that at top form, like this, defends the capitalization of art.\n\nWhere \"CSI\" goes dumb is in the easy confessions cops get out of criminals. And the personal stories of detectives are too rare to give the show much depth.\n\nThat said, Sara's departure brought about a sweet scene where Fox portrayed quiet despair. When she finally split the Las Vegas cop shop, Fox commanded long and lovely little scenes for Sara to just be, to just sit, to deteriorate on camera.\n\n[...]\n\n",

Standard spoiler alert: Avert your eyes if you don't want to know.\n\nYou'll recall that a year ago, fans of the show were either really happy or really angry that a romantic relationship between Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) was revealed. It sent the \"CSI\" message boards into a frenzy for months. (Petersen, Fox and producers addressed the controversy here, here and here.)\n\nIn any case, here's what happens in the upcoming season finale: \"The &#8216;miniature killer's' identity is revealed. As the CSI team tries to track down this diabolical murderer, Sara (Jorja Fox) mysteriously goes missing &#8212; and Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara's relationship is suddenly forced out into the open.\"\n\nDun-dun-dun!\n\n[...]\n",

        "content": "\nSo what is happening with Sara Sidle on \"CSI\"?\n\nThe character appeared to have been crushed under a car as the Season 7 finale ended, and all summer blogs have buzzed with speculation about actress Jorja Fox's contract negotiations with CBS. Does it mean anything that Fox wasn't in a recent \"CSI\" cast photo in TV Guide?\n\nSidle, as fans know, was in a relationship with Gil Grissom (William Petersen), and the entire \"CSI\" team found out about the romance in the season finale. \n\nNow there's a bit of news about the show, and it may have some bearing on Sidle's role in Season 8: The show is adding a recurring female character.\n\nStarting Oct. 11, Jessica Lucas will appear in four episodes of the show as Veronica Lake, who goes by the nickname \"Ronnie.\" She's \"a young, overzealous new CSI in training, who is extremely bright, albeit naÃ¯ve,\" according to a CBS press release.\n\n\"CSI\" returns with its Season 8 premiere on Sept. 27, and on the network's press Web site, there's more fodder for pro- and anti-Grissom-Sara contingents (one of TV's most vocal wars has been fought over whether those two should be together). The Season 7 finale, which revealed the identity of the Miniature Killer, was called \"Living Doll,\" and the Season 8 premiere is titled \"Dead Doll.\"\n\nA photo caption on the CBS site had a tidbit about at least one scene from the season opener: \"Grissom (William Petersen) finds the missing car but no signs of Sara, the latest victim of the miniature killer.\"\n\nOf course this could all be a big misinformation campaign by CBS, and for all we know Sidle could be a part of the show all season long.\n\n[...]",

TV Guide's Ausiello interviewed Fox last month and at that time, she refused to respond to the rumors about her departure from the series. Today, Entertainment Weekly has reported that the rumors are true.\n\nFox reportedly told \"EW\" that her decision to leave the show wasn't money related. She's just done being saddled down to a weekly TV show. She seems pretty confident that \"CSI\" will do fine without her, saying, \"If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by.\"\n\nFox will remain in her role as Sara Sidle for five more episodes of \"CSI\" this season before making her departure from the series. Her last episode will air sometime in mid-November.  \n",

Her character, Sara Sidle, is a fan favourite and website DollarsForSense.com has been asking fans to send in letters voicing disapproval over Fox's departure.

        "content": "\nEvery lesbian's favourite \"CSI\" star, Jorja Fox, isn't your average sexpot. The attractive but geeky tomboy hasn't graced the pages of Vogue, she doesn't spend each episode in impossibly high heels, and you're more likely to find her at a PETA rally protesting animal cruelty than pitching Revlon products to you from a talk show on the Oxygen Network. That's why we love her and her strong, sexy brand of androgyny and even her slightly intoxicating don't-care-to-talk-about-my-personal-life attitude. But, just once, wouldn't it be nice if she didn't have to take herself so seriously? We turned the tables on the earnest star with an exclusive, old-fashioned girlie-girl interview that dares to ask the questions on everyone's mind (except, of course, that one) about work, fashion and why you should never wear lavender perfume on a date.\n\nWhat's the best part of doing \"CSI\"?  \n  \nIt's a multifold question. I think first and foremost, I love the character I get to play [element analyst Sara Sidle]. I think she's totally fascinating and much braver than me and smarter than me. She studied physics at Harvard and Berkeley, so I get really excited to go to work and get to be her. I think the writers, who I think are geniuses, have done a really good job of trying to give us, or at least me, different things to do every season. I get to solve the crimes and get to sort of wear the superhero cape, but at the same time I have something in my personal life going on. I'm really lucky that way.\n\nIt sounds like you can balance work with your own life.  \n  \nI think it takes like a couple of years. We're in our fifth season now, and it's so much better in terms of the amount of hours we work, and they try to split it up so nobody gets burned out. You'll be heavy for a couple of shows, and then you'll be light for a couple of shows. I think the whole idea for our show in the last couple of years is like, well, how can we maintain this and not burn everybody out? And they've done a great job at that, so it makes it, in many ways, a very easy job to go to. It's nothing like doing a series like the first two seasons, you know, when you have no idea what you're doing, where you're going, what you're shooting.\n\nA lot of people with families like working on TV. Is that a draw for you?  \n  \nI think it's probably really good for me, but it's not normally who I am at all. I'm a real nomad, so it has been weird to sort of set roots down in Los Angeles and be here for the most part, for most of the year. And if I get to travel, I travel on a normal schedule, sort of when everyone else in America is travelling, so that was actually something that I had to adapt to because I didn't consider that a plus at the time.\n\nDo you see yourself settling down, married with kids?  \n  \nI don't know if I'll ever completely settle down, but I certainly believe in love, and I love love, and I hope that I'm lucky enough that I'm able to sort of be with somebody in a way that I can see is for a long time. That would be nice. I've definitely had commitment issues all my life about everything, whether it's a job or a love interest or a place to live. Like I said, I'm really a nomad. I come from a long line of nomads, so I think I'm part of that L.A. syndrome.\n\nPlus, you meet other actors who are total nomads.  \n  \nI am terrible at the long-distance relationship thing.\n\nAnd you don't want to fall in love with co-stars because if it doesn't work you have to see them every day.  \n  \nI think I have been in love with every one of my co-stars at a different time or another.\n\nI think I have been in love with your co-stars, too.  \n  \n[Laughs] I'm lucky at that. And that would be a second thing, like, what do I love about my job? I really love the people I work with.\n\nYou surf?  \n  \nA little bit. I'm not great, but I love it, and I go out a lot. I grew up in a small beach town in Florida, so my whole life I was swimming and boogie boarding, and then I moved to New York City when I was 16, which is the exact same age that my mother actually let me get a surfboard. So I never got good, but I had one, and I started. But I'd say like two years ago in L.A., I got serious about it.\n\nYou can't surf in N.Y., can you? You'd have to take your board on the train!  \n  \nAnd that's what I used to do with my boogie board. I'd get on the Long Island Expressway with my boogie board. Isn't that funny? It was weird because I was there this summer, and I actually saw a guy walking down the street with a surfboard, and it's the first time I'd ever seen that in New York, and I lived there for like 12 years. I was like, where's the breaks, you know? Where are you going?\n\nHow often do you go surfing? A couple of times a week?  \n  \nYeah, usually. It gets harder in the winter with the rain because I like to wait like five or six days after it rains before I'm in the water. So between working and the rain pattern, that's when I get a little rusty.\n\nDo you have to work out at all, or can you just surf to stay in shape?  \n  \nIf I can go out, that can be my workout. I do work out, and I mostly work out for stress because again, I find in L.A., if you don't actively go out and get exercise, you don't get any at all. Yeah, you sort of have to make a point of it, so here, usually I hike and I run, and I love to run because I can do that anywhere. No matter where I'm going, I can just throw my sneakers in my suitcase, and I can go run.\n\nHow long do you run for?  \n  \nI'm pretty lazy about that too. Probably like two miles. I have a big dog. The most loyal workout partner in the world! She's a boxer [8 years old]. Her name is Ali, like Muhammad the boxer, and she never says no. Like, she never cancels on me. She always wants to go, so we'll hike part, we'll run. I try to work out every other day, and then sometimes I have a couple of days off in a row, and then I'll work out every day. And then of course there's days that I'm shooting, because if I'm shooting like 14 hours, it's the first thing to fall off my schedule book. It just doesn't work out for me because I mostly like to work out outside. I'll go running up until about 10 o'clock at night, but if I'm getting off after that, it just doesn't happen.\n\nSo it sounds like you don't do anything too extreme.  \n  \nI'm lucky because I'm really tall and I have really long limbs. I'm actually not in great shape. I always think I can be in better shape, and I kind of wish I was one of those people that was more disciplined about being in better shape. That's the thing, I could never spend like four hours a day in a gym. I just couldn't do it. It's sort of a trade-off. I never think of myself as somebody that's in great shape. I don't have a scale in my house. I was a chubby kid. I was chubby from like 8 to 16, and so that was like one of those things, it's just better for me not to obsess over that. My mom was a Depression mom, and God bless her, there wasn't enough food in the house [so] she just fed my brother and I. She just overfed us. She was so happy to have money to have food on the table. I was eating like five meals a day until I was about 16, and then I realised, you know, maybe I could cut down to three. I'd probably be OK.\n\nHow do you unwind?  \n  \nI like to go for hikes and, obviously stuff we already talked about, surfing I love to do. I love massage. That's my big thing, even if I'm going to the spa, I'll almost always go for the massage over any other treatment, but I do love a pedicure, especially if it's the kind that comes with the little leg massage. That's the best part.\n\nHow is your style different from your character's style?  \n  \nWow, this has been very lucky for me. Like obviously if I had to pick something that I was going to wear pretty much every day for five years, it would definitely be jeans and boots, and that's mostly what the character wears. For a feature film, I'd go off the cuff, like whatever, corsets, you name it. But it's really great to go and get to be comfortable most of the time.\n\nSo jeans and a T-shirt and you're good.  \n  \nFor the most part, yeah. It goes with the guitar and surfboard. The attention to beauty in Los Angeles, I think, is a really cool thing. It extends in everything: home dÃ©cor, the cars people drive â¦ everything, and certain neighbourhoods, down to the medians and how well they're manicured, and I think that's so rare. There's so many visual artists here, and they pay a lot of attention to making life more beautiful and pleasing. In restaurants, the design is really cool, so I love all that, but I also love being in Beverly Hills in my jeans and boots because it feels actually kind of scandalous. Oops, forgot my Prada today! I get a certain joy and satisfaction out of that.\n\nDo you like vintage looks?  \n  \nI'm a lot more likely to do that if I'm dressing up. You know what I also love? I love wearing business suits. That's something that just happened to me in the past year. I have never even owned a tailored shirt in my life, and I guess I figured I have my whole life to move into business suits. This year I've been lucky enough, especially sort of like charity events and stuff that are often business attire, so it's the first year that I've actually bought a couple of suits and some shirts. Off the rack, again I would go Theory at Fred Segal. They have really great stuff. And J. Crew makes great suits for ready-to-wear suits. â¦[T]here's a store called Clover in Silverlake and Pull My Daisy, and they don't have a huge selection of suits, but what they do have is really interesting and it's cut nicely and it sort of has a little flair to it, like something different, but still really nice stuff and well made. I go there a lot.\n\nDo you wish you could change your hairstyle?  \n  \nI've been acting since I was like 20, so there were years that I wanted to have more punk rock or more rock ân' roll style. Every time I would dye my hair, I'd get a job, and three days later I'd be back in the place dyeing it back to my natural colour. For a while, it was almost like that thing, like actors have little tricks, like when they need a job, they plan a vacation, so [I would say to myself] if I colour my hair purple, I'll get work, and I kind of like that. There is still a part of me, [though] I think I'm getting a little too old for it. But a lot of those really rebellious hairstyles, I would love to do some of those. Like tiger stripes.\n\nYou wore a vintage Chanel to the Emmys. Do you have a favourite red-carpet look?  \n  \nOh my gosh, just barely presentable, really. Fashion is not my specialty, and especially like, black tie. It's really not my specialty. Like, I know what I like. There's weird things because it's specific, too. It's not like just kind of going to a regular party, as you know, so it's gotta be comfortable. It's gotta be like, nine-hour comfortable because, as you know, from the time you hit the red carpet until the time you get home, it's usually about nine or 10 hours.\n\nAnd the shoes can be killersâ¦  \n  \nThat's the key. You learn these funny little things, you know, I've had to leave those kinds of events because I just couldn't walk anymore in my shoes. And I don't want that to happen anymore. I kind of feel like, I want to be able to stay to the end and not leave because I can't feel my legs â and have fun and be able to dance and eat and breathe. I'm a real stickler for that. I don't wear just any trains. I'm a clod, anyway. That's a bad combination for me.\n\nHow do you describe your personal style?  \n  \nWow. I think I'd probably say for me, and it has a lot to do right now with just working so much and so long, I always just kind of want to look healthy and sort of well rested, and a little like that just-got-out-of-bed look. And usually I'm tired, I haven't slept, I'm drinking six cups of coffee a day.\n\nDo you wear makeup off-set?  \n  \nAbsolutely not, usually. And that's another thing, too. I would probably wear more if I wasn't working so much. I'm lucky enough to be working so much that if I'm not, I really like my skin to have a chance to breathe. And the makeup's actually quite heavy because it's full foundation, concealer and powder, and then we get a little bit of extreme temperatures, so it can either be like up to 110 degrees, or it can be down to 40. We shoot like 40 minutes north of L.A., so it's not the L.A. basin. The temperatures are sort of like the high desert. It's not like shooting in New York or Chicago, but it's really cold in the winter, and it's really, really hot in the summer. Depending on that, they keep caking stuff on, you know what I mean? Powder can get very thick. By 4 o'clock in the afternoon in July, you can like put a pin through your face. I just like to have a chance to give my skin a little break. And I'm at the beach a lot when I'm not working, and that's an excuse not to wear too much makeup. I'm literally in the water and out of the water, and it never goes well, the mascara and the surfing.\n\nYou sound low maintenance.  \n  \nYeah, I would probably put me in the extreme low maintenance category.\n\nWhat skin care products do you like?  \n  \nI'm a natural products kind of person because I'm a freak, so I'm a big Aveda person. I like their stuff. I'll go sometimes for the oxygen facials.\n\nAt Aveda?  \n  \nNo, not so much Aveda. There's a couple places in town. I usually go to Burke Williams all the time. Ona Spa, I go there. Usually I do something really non-invasive because there's the other thing, too, I don't go that much â¦ I'd like to go more, but again with my schedule, it's hard to commit, you know how sometimes facials can mess up your skin for a few days. Because we're shooting nine months out of the year, I don't really like to risk it, so I go for the very like, they have an Ayurvedic facial, I think it's at the Four Seasons, like all this Ayurvedic stuff, and it's really gentle stuff â¦ no peels or anything like that. I'm not big on that stuff.\n\nDo you wear perfumes on the set?  \n  \nAgain, because I'm kind of sensitive to chemicals, so I don't ever wear perfume, but I wear oils. I love oils. I get them at the health food store.\n\nLike Lavender?  \n  \nYou know what? I love lavender, it's one of my favourite scents, but I think I read in some â¦ big magazine that lavender is a really great scent, but when people were tested on it, it sort of was a nurturing, mothering scent to most people, so I don't wear it all the time. I would never wear it on a date. I would never wear it if I was trying to, you know, sort of work my sensual side. Obviously if I'm hanging out with my grandmother or I'm going to the beach, I'll douse myself with the lavender because I love it.\n\nThen what is a sexy scent? Musk?  \n  \nYeah, the musks I think are really sexy, and the Body Shop has some really nice ones actually, and they do oils and they do perfumes. And I still like the muskier scents like patchouli and amber and â¦ even like citrus, sort of like an orange spice something.\n\nA lot of perfumes smell a little too frou-frou.  \n  \nThey will give me a headache, and I'll give myself a headache. The other place I like a lot, there's a place called Andy's Garden on Melrose, and they do a lot of sprays and mints and like aura sprays, and their stuff is all natural; there's no chemicals in it. I wear a lot of those, and they're of course very ethereal, so their scents are like Joy or Love or Creativity. I love those.",

But after news that \"CSI\" star Jorja Fox would be quitting the show, Internet crazies started rallying together to keep her fighting TV crime.\n\nSo far, online group Dollarforsense.com has deluged CBS's offices with whack-job gifts in the hopes of keeping Fox's character, Sara Sidle, on the show. So far, their stunts have stopped just short of being mistaken as the calling cards of one of \"CSI\"'s rotating cast of psycho killers. They've hired planes to fly \"Keep Jorja Fox on \"CSI\"\" messages over CBS studios, stuffed execs' offices with balloons and inexplicably sent off 192 chocolate-covered insects. \n\nThe crux of their efforts, though, revolves around a letter-writing campaign encouraging fans to mail dollar bills to the show's writers and producers. At press time, nearly $10,000 US was awaiting delivery. Curiously, the campaign isn't addressing the cash to Fox herself, who's leaving the show after being reportedly unable to wrangle a sweet enough contract. Ah well, surely the \"CSI\" staff will appreciate the year's worth of free frappuccinos.",

But Fox wouldn't show up for work, forcing the producers to film an alternate ending - including last-minute script rewrites and flying co-star Marg Helgenberger from L.A. to Vegas for expensive re-shoots.\n\nFox's rep told The New York Post yesterday that the actress' future on the show was up in the air. \"Her contract is up and they are in conversations,\" said the spokeswoman.\n\nThis was not Fox's first salary dispute with the show. In 2004, she and co-star George Eads, who plays Nick Stokes, were fired by CBS after refusing to come to work during a contract dispute. They were re-hired a few days later.\n\nFox reportedly rakes in $100,000-per-episode and was demanding a \"major raise.\" CBS reportedly offered her a \"moderate raise,\" which she balked at.\n\nThe story could be bogus but something is going on. The Chicago Tribune reports that Sara will \"go missing\" in the season finale cliffhanger.",

The actor that plays her, not so much.\n\nJorja Fox, who has starred on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" since its inception in 2000, will not complete the series' current season, bowing out after the seventh episode in November, E! Online TV columnist Kristin Dos Santos reports.\n\nThe news will no doubt be a blow to fans of the actress, albeit not a surprising one.\n\nHer departure comes after rocky contract negotiations offscreen and an onscreen story line that has been foreshadowing for months a less than happy ending for her character.\n\nIt was the inability for Fox and producers to come to terms on a salary boost, which they had been negotiating since January, that put the final nail in her \"CSI\" coffin.\n\nThe story should sound more than a little familiar to fans of the show.\n\nFox, along with costar George Eads, both were fired from their acting gigs back in 2004, when they famously held out, unsuccessfully, for a bigger payday. They eventually were hired back after making public mea culpas. Eads wound up with a contract extension, but not Fox.\n\nWhile the contracts for the entire \"CSI \"cast expires at the end of the current season, Fox's lapsed in May.\n\nProducers appeared to waste no time in finding a would-be replacement.\n\nIn July, show-runner Carol Mendelsohn announced that the series would be taking on a new female lab technician that will be introduced in the current season's third episode. Producer Jonathan Littman also confirmed at a network event over the summer that the Grissom-Sara storyline would definitely be concluding this season.\n\nLast month, actress Jessica Lucas was hired for the Vegas crime lab, although producers, playing down rumors of Fox's exit, insisted Lucas was only brought on for a guest stint.\n\nWhile it's unclear whether Fox's character will leave voluntary or mortally&mdash;the cast recently wrapped the fifth episode of the season&mdash;fans were put out of their summerlong misery Thursday night when Sara survived.\n\nHer character's fate was the major cliffhanger from last season's finale; Thursday's season opener revealed that that Sara escaped alive from her run-in with the \"Miniature Killer.\"\n\nFox's departure comes at a time when \"CSI\" couldn't be stronger. The series' seventh season premiere bested the \"Grey's Anatomy\" season debut Thursday by the largest margin since the ratings juggernauts first squared off. The CBS procedural averaged 24.8 million viewers, while the sudsy medical drama drew in just 20.5 million.",

        "content": "\n**Jorja Fox Leaving &#8216;CSI\"\"\n\nThe actress will appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the top-rated show that made her a household name\n\n\"CSI\"'s Jorja Fox -- who was briefly fired from the show in 2004 during an ugly contract dispute with CBS -- is expected to leave the top-rated drama before year's end. A source close to the show confirms that Fox, whose contract expired last season, has agreed to appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the show that made her a household name and turned her into an unwilling poster child for greedy TV actors.\n\nBack in 2004, CBS offered what it described as \"fair and equitable raises\" to the CSI ensemble. To avoid last-minute sick-outs, like the ones that happened with the \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" cast earlier that year, the network then required many of the supporting actors, including Fox and George Eads, to promise in writing that they would show up on time when production resumed on the fifth season. Supposedly, everyone signed, but Fox opted to send her agreement in the mail and CBS received it late. On July 14 of that year, she was fired from her $100K job. (Eads was also briefly fired for not showing up on time.)\n\n\"I sat on it because I kept thinking there was still talking to be done,\" Fox told EW back in 2004. \"I wouldn't say I was in denial, but I thought, &#8216;This can be fixed.' When it hit the press late Thursday, that's when I started to worry it was really happening. I didn't know whether I was supposed to accept the fact I'd lost my job or whether I was supposed to be figuring out a way to get it back. It was all very confusing and fast.\"\n\nWith production delayed one week, CBS started to explore contingency plans, like hiring new actors and having Fox's character disappear into rehab after she was picked up for driving drunk in season four. Ultimately, no auditions were needed: CBS decided to let the letter incident go, and Fox and Eads was hired back -- albeit at the same pay they earned before the negotiations.\n\nFox is leaving at a time when \"CSI\" couldn't be stronger. Last night's season premiere bested \"Grey's Anatomy\" by 21 percent in the overnight ratings.",

So far, they've orchestrated three airplane flyovers in the airspace above the Universal lot in Los Angeles (with \"Save Jorja\" banners) and sent $3,500 in cash to the \"CSI\" production offices (to help offset Fox's six-figure salary). They're also bombarding the producers with balloons and Life Savers candy. For the record, no one at CBS/Paramount has officially confirmed that Fox is going bye-bye, though one key insider admits it's a fait accompli. Because of that, it seems highly unlikely that the efforts of [http://www.dollarforsense.com www.dollarforsense.com] will succeed, but then who knew an Internet campaign -- and truckloads of peanuts -- would save a bomb (from a ratings POV, that is) like \"Jericho?\"",

Fox, along with CBS, have yet to officially confirm or deny her departure.

        "content": "The actress' decision to leave TV's No. 1 show has \"nothing to do with money,\" she tells EW in an exclusive sit-down\n\nIn the Sept. 27 premiere of CSI, the show's 25.2 million fans were relieved to learn that not only had Jorja Fox's alter ego, Sara Sidle, survived a brutal abduction by the infamous Miniature Killer, but Internet rumors of her departure from the seven-year-old drama were greatly exaggerated. Or so they thought. \n\nNo need to follow the clues anymore, because the mystery (finally!) stops here: Fox has quit the No. 1 show on TV. Oct. 15 was her final day on set, and episode 8 of season 8  set to air in mid-November  will be her last. The decision comes three years after the 39-year-old actress and costar George Eads were fired (and later rehired) during an ugly contract dispute with CBS Paramount. This time, however, it was the daily grind of an intense weekly drama  not money  that drove the decision, claims Fox. In this exclusive interview, Fox explains why she's leaving the program that netted her a six-figure-a-week salary, and discusses her last days on set, the final episode, and just what the heck she's going to do next. \n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So, Jorja, whose call was this for you to leave *CSI*  yours or CBS'? \n\nJORJA FOX: It's my call  and a very, very difficult one, something I've been thinking about for a long, long time. It's one of the hardest decisions I've made in my life. It has nothing to do with my contract, nothing to do with money.... It could be the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Only time will tell. \n\nOkay, butâ¦why?\n\nThere are so many things I want to do! Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old.... It's a really intense place to work. A lot of the stories [on the show] do end sadly and badly. That's been one of the things I've struggled with  the violence. I'm not saying I'll never do another violent [project], because I'm sure that I'll be back in that world someday, but it's really good for me to take a break from it.\n\nHas doing a procedural drama become boring?\n\nIt has nothing to do with being bored. I wish it did! It would make it a lot easier to go.\n\nWere you at the end of your contract?\n\nOriginally we all signed on for six years and there was a seventh season added. At the end of the seventh, there would be a window [to negotiate]. If I thought this show was on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like it's going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by, I have to get off the ride. \n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you start to think about leaving?\n\nJORJA FOX: CBS and I had been talking in January. Nothing was resolved until June. CBS was very flexible. We structured something a little odd.\n\nLike episode to episode.\n\nYes. I wasn't prepared to sign up for an extra two seasons, or even a full one, and they were willing to roll with that. The situation could have been different. They could have said this or nothing. They were very gracious. \n\nThe 2007 season finale left open the possibility that Sara could end up dead. Do you think the producers anticipated that you might leave so they were preparing for your absence?\n\nI have no idea. Some stories we know a little bit about, some we don't. I knew there would be something specific between the Miniature Killer and Sara, but all the specifics about the abduction I did not know until the week we started shooting the finale [in April]. And I did not know whether she would make it until I got the script in early July.\n\nIt seems that nasty rumors about contract negotiations have dogged you since 2004, when you and costar George Eads were temporarily fired from *CSI*. What happened there, exactly?\n\nI know it's really difficult for people to think an individual would be fired over a letter, but that's the truth of my situation. It had nothing to do with money. It was two days before the season was to start, and CBS sent out a letter that they wanted everybody to sign and get back. [The letter provided a written promise to CBS that everyone would show up for the first day of production.] I returned the letter, but I guess I didn't return it in the fashion that I was supposed to. By the time it arrived, they had fired me the day before work started. [Eads was fired for not showing up to set on time, though he claimed at the time that he'd overslept.] Within a couple of days, CBS kindly invited me back. I didn't beg for my job back. They offered me a raise at that point, but I declined because it included an extra year and George was still fired. It didn't feel right to take a raise. And secondly, I was pretty hurt and angry and confused. I still had three years to go on my contract. I was not even sure I wanted to be there.\n\nAre you surprised at the lengths to which CBS went?\n\nI was really confused by it. It came completely out of the blue to be fired, and there were no rumblings of it. I didn't feel like I was on thin ice with anybody. All the actors had asked for a raise. It's traditional if a show is doing well, and because our contracts are so very long. It's not the worst thing in the world to ask for a raise. I think everybody else in Hollywood, including network execs, has the opportunity to ask for a raise or a change in scenery in a much shorter time frame than actors. But I do think the networks have to protect themselves. The reason the contracts are so long is because actors are very spontaneous; we may want to do Shakespeare one day and be Porky Pig the next!\n\nGiven the protracted salary renegotiation that CBS had just gone through on *Everybody Loves Raymond*, do you think CBS was looking to make an example of you?\n\nI think CBS wanted to make a point at that time, and I think they made it really successfully. And I'd like to think of it as flattering. Maybe I was one of the people picked for that mission because they thought I had the fortitude to hang tough and weather it. I've got to say for the record: If you've got to get fired, it's really fabulous to get fired with a friend. I'll thank George forever. I can only say as a person who got fired on a Wednesday, the fact that I had company on a Thursday was comforting.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Fans will surely be disappointed. You're leaving during a key development in the Gil-Sara relationship: He proposes marriage!\n\nJORJA FOX: One of Sara's biggest hopes was that her hiring seven years ago would lead to a very significant, stable relationship with Gil [William Petersen]. So it is rather ironic that Sara should finally get this proposal and we find later in the season that she would be disappearing from CSI.\n\nSo, what happens to Sara in that final episode?\n\nThe stakes will be very high. It required me to go deeper than I ever have. It was an emotional episode for everyone, certainly for me. I've been exhausted since before the premiere, in such an odd way. There has been an incredible outpouring of support from my fans  and confusion. Because I think a lot of the fans believe this is a contractual issue and has something to do with money.\n\nIs Sara's departure written in a way that she could return later?\n\nLet's just say if there is an opportunity to guest-star, I'd be thrilled. It would be impossible to say definitely one way or another because the writers are still making that stuff up. I would never rule anything out. But I'm not trying to lead anybody on, either.\n\nCan you see yourself taking a series-regular role on another show?\n\nAbsolutely not. If I'm going to be on a TV show right now, it should be CSI. I think I'll give it some time before I even entertain ideas of doing a different show.\n\nWhat are you going to do now? \n\nI might buy a ticket for around the world. It's also summer in the Southern Hemisphere, so I might take a surf trip. I forgot to have kids! And there are several projects of my own that I'm excited about.\n\nWhat were your final days like on the *CSI* set?\n\nI definitely took a final look around. I kissed a lot of people and things, though we do so many gross things on the set, it's not the first place you want to put your lips.  \n",

But until now, its producers and CBS have never had to wonder. The original cast from the pilot episode-Petersen, Helgenberger, George Eads, Gary Dourdan, and Paul Guilfoyle-is still intact. Jorja Fox joined the cast for the second episode, and her Sara Sidle character becomes the first major departure from the show tonight. Sara's disenchantment with the unending parade of crime has been one of the themes to the season so far, so tonight's episode figures to be emotional. Her relationship with Petersen's Grissom, the revelation of which may have been the biggest shocker ever for a show that deals with corpses, was controversial for a subgroup of fans who worried that \"Grey's Anatomymy\" might scare the producers into soaping it up, but it has been handled in a way that respects what we've learned about both characters over eight seasons.\n\nLeaving \"CSI\" could not have been an easy decision for Fox, who bounced around TV for years, most notably in a somewhat thankless semi-regular role on \"ER\", before striking gold in Las Vegas. She may not be the last to leave. Petersen in particular has made noises about turning in his bugs, so it might behoove fans to keep looking for little signs, such as Grissom's confession to Anthony LaPaglia's Malone character at the end of last week's \"Without a Trace\" crossover, that \"CSI\" might soon be in for its biggest change yet.\n\n",

        "content": "\nWe recently invited Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda of the hit television series *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation *to share their professional and Academy experiences with us.\n\nIn what ways do you value the training you received at AADA?\n\nAADA really taught me to be in the moment. To be as present as I can. I use that training all the time every day. The teachers had high expectations of us, but were very kind and supportive. I loved being in the middle of NYC. There was inspiration and excitement on every corner. I also loved that AADA was college credited. At that time, it was the only acting school that was college credited. I've always thought higher learning should be expansive and independent. AADA is both.\n\nYou have been on three highly successful television series â *ER,The West Wing, *and *CSI, *all dramas. Do you have any interest in doing comedy?\n\nI would love to do a romantic comedy...... I love romantic comedies. I feel really blessed that if I have been type cast, that it's these gun toting, tough, smart, city women. I love comedy. I don't think I'm very funny, unfortunately. But I would love to try....\n\nWhat was your first professional acting job?\n\nI got the lead in a small film. *The Kill Off *directed by Maggie Greenwald. It was a Jim Thompson adaptation. Very dark and gloomy. I played a very depressed kid who eventually becomes a heroin addict. I didn't work as an actor after that for a solid year. The film went to Sundance. Although none of us could afford to go with it, it was very exciting.\n\nHow do you play a character that you do not connect to â or do not like?\n\nI don't. If my heart's not in it, my work really suffers. It's obvious when I'm not passionate about what I'm doing, which isn't fair to my employers or me. I've had jobs I haven't loved to pay the rent but never artistic ones. Bartending, temping, that kind of thing. If I don't care for the story or the role I don't take the job.\n\nWas there a defining moment in your career when you realized you were a successful actor?\n\nI'm still waiting for it. I've been very lucky. Every time I get a job, I'm sure I'm going to get fired. I'm not sure that it's all that good for me to get too comfortable artistically. I'd rather be nervous than bored.\n\nDo you have a favorite role that you have played?\n\nMy favorite role to date is âSara Sidle' on CSI. It was really rewarding to be with the show from the beginning and to take a fairly big risk, at least I thought so, by leaving the West Wing *to go to *CSI. I was so intrigued by the story and yet I thought it was going to be a big flop. Who would want to watch a show about death on Friday nights? I love Sarah's intensity, her obsession with the truth, her lack of self-aware-ness, her humor and how smart she is. I love that she's so much smarter than I am.\n\nWhat advice would you give to current AADA students who are embarking on acting careers?\n\nDo what you love. Be yourself. It sounds fairly corny, but there really is only one you in the universe. Instead of trying to be somebody else, be you. Nobody can compete with that. And it will give you at least one thing, probably many more, but at least one thing that nobody else has. Hang tough. Acting is such a balance of patience and persistence. Get used to that tight rope. And get used to and learn to love not really having a lot of stability in your life. I thrive on that. Where will I be next year? Where will I be next month? I love that.\n\nWe know that you run a theatre company â Honeypot Productions - and that you have written and directed for them. Were there any particular challenges you encountered doing this work and if so how did you overcome them?\n\nThere are always challenges. I run the company with several other folks. I could never do it alone. We're trying right now to go from a small back yard theatre company to a legitimate traveling troupe. It's a full time job for someone. All of us in the company have \"day jobs.\" The theatre is a collective hobby and mild addiction for all of us. So a lack of time is really the hardest part. Finding funding is always interesting. It is really great to have something creative though, that is really just for the fun of it. There's no huge goal to meet or large entity to satisfy.That's pretty rare these days in the \"biz.\"\n\nDo you have any aspirations to write or direct for television?\n\nNot so much. I think I'd be a terrible director. I am not detail oriented at all. And I'm not very visual. I would love to work with actors. I love writing, but I think I'd be really bad at the pace and collaborative spirit of writing for television.\n\nWhat is the difference between acting on stage and on camera? And is there any way to prepare for those differences?\n\nI think if I think too much about the differences that's when I get tripped up. In theatre I really practice filling the room. A lot of stages use microphones now but I came up having to fill the space with my voice and still work at being as natural and again, as present as possible. On camera most of it is so small. TV in particular shoots so much in tight close-ups. It's about being as still as possible and as natural and present at the same time. Of course the priceless thrill of theatre is the live audience that gives so much more than they get and the uniqueness of every single show. One of my favorite parts of TV and film is getting to do things over. So much less stressful, but also less original.....\n\nDo you have any upcoming projects that you are excited about?\n\nAfter January, I let myself think a little bit about summer ideas, which is usually just being the laziest person I know. I have never been a workaholic, yet I am always working on some play........\n\nThanks so much for the opportunity to speak with you guys. Kiss NYC for me. I am always missing her.....\n\n",

        "content": "\nEvery young actress with ambition hopes to make it in movies. But if it doesn't work out the way you wanted, television can be a great alternative for a successful career. A great example of this is Jorja Fox (38).\n\nShe has appeared on the hit series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] for six years. Previous, she appeared on two other hit series: [[ER]] and [[The West Wing]].\n\nAnyone who tries to remember her movies, probably comes up with [[Memento]]. In that movie, she played the wife of the main character, played by Guy Pearce, who, short after the death of his wife, loses his memory. Practically speaking, there were just a few short scenes with Jorja in it, so there was not so much acting involved. So Jorja concentrated on television.\n\nJorja Fox, born on 7 July 1968 in New York, daughter of Canadian immigrants, spent her childhood in Florida. When she was 15, she won a modeling contest, which really amazed her because she was the only brunette in the contest. After winning the contest she moved to New York. After three years of modeling in America and Europe she stopped, she wanted to be an actress.\n\nShe attended the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York and started a long road of small roles in TV series and films for seven years. In 1996 she got her first big role as the no-nonsense Dr. [[Maggie Doyle]] in the hit series ER. The role of the vegetarian lesbian doctor fit Jorja perfectly, because she is both herself. She appeared in 33 episodes of ER and after that she tried movies again. She appeared in three movies, the last of which being Memento. In 2000 she played an agent of the Secret Service, protecting the daughter of the president, in the West wing.\n\nRight now Jorja plays [[Sara Sidle]] in CSI, which recently celebrated their 150st episode. There was a little problem in 2004 when she refused to sign her contract for the new season. But soon she realized that she didn't want to quit playing this great role on this hit series.",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox may have new mysteries to solve every week on CSI, but she has a kindhearted philosophy about animals all figured out.\n\nLOS ANGELES CONFIDENTIAL: You're currently starring on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*, one of the hottest shows on TV, yet it's rumored your dream job would be to have a show on Animal Planet. Is that true?\n\nJORJA FOX: It was one of those childhood dreams that never completely went away. I worshiped Jacques Cousteau and watched every epiosde of National Geographic that aired. I always had that dream about being somebody who was out in the field working with animals &#8212; wild animals in particular. That would be great, traveling all over the world and presenting animals to people.\n\nLAG: Tell us about your dog and cats.\n\nJF: I have a dog, named Ali, as in Muhammad Ali; she's a ten-and-a-half-year-old boxer. And I have two cats, Rumplestiltskin and Sid Poitier, both 16 years old. They all came with their names, except Sid Poitier, who was originally called Sid Vicious. He started to display those traits, so I changed it to Poitier in the hope that he'd become more gentlemanly ... which he did. Hey, what's in a name?\n\nLAG: Sounds like you have a soft spot for seniors.\n\nJF: Yeah. It's unfortunate that more people don't get how great they are. You don't have to do all that work with these wonderful older pets. They don't chew anymore, they don't run away anymore. [That's] the gift of a senior animal.\n\nLAG: And how did they all come to live with you?\n\nJF: Well, they're all rescues from New York. When Ali first came to LA, I tried taking her for hikes, but because she'd been living in New York City her whole life, she was terrified and would just sit down and shake. So I walked her up and down Melrose Avenue with the concrete, storefronts, and all the activity ... that was the most comforting thing I could do for her.\n\nLAG: What was your earliest introduction to animals?\n\nJF: We were a dog family. My mom's traditional way of adopting dogs was to go to the pound and pick the ugliest dog there, the one she thought had the least chance of getting adopted. So we really had some funny-looking dogs growing up! And then there was my grandmother, a massive animal lover who appreciated all things wild. She was a real environmentalist, which was trendsetting at the time.\n\nSpeaking of trendsetting, I'd also love to plug something I saw on TV... There's a brand new airline called Companion Air that's based out of Florida. There're not fully up and running yet, but the whole idea is that they're going to have a fleet of small private planes with the primary purpose being that people can travel on the plane with their pets. Their prices aren't for everyone, but they're still pretty competitive. It will surely make it easier for people to travel with their pets.\n\nLAG: We understand that you helped open the North Central Animal Shelter here in Los Angeles last October. What kind of an experience was that for you?\n\nJF:That's so nice to say, but everyone else did the work. I just showed up at the opening. Lacey Street is my local shelter, so I've been there many times over the years. What really struck me was how beautifully the place has transformed. I think Los Angelenos should do themselves a favor and check it out. There's a real feeling of hope since the day of the re-opening, the mayor [Antonio Villaaigosa] and other politicians were there, giving a press conference. The coolest thing I've heard in a long time was when the mayor stated that it's the city's goal over the next five years to convert all the shelters in Los Angeles to no-kill shelters. I don't think people realize what a staggering number of animals are euthanized every year. Surprisingly a lot of farm animals also end up in city shelters. I'm really active in Animal Acres [http://animalacres.org animalacres.org], which is an amazing sanctuary for farm animals.\n\nLAG: Is there a specific message you'd like to share with the readers?\n\nJF: My love and passion is for all things and places wild, and to protect those things and places &#8212; not like a museum, but because [their survival] has a direct impact on everything [else] on this planet.\n\n",

        "content": "\nThis &8216;CSI' snoop knows how to locate L.A.'s vegetarian options\nYOU know the face. Jorja Fox has had major roles in three of TV's biggest hits -- \"ER\" (as Dr. Maggie Doyle), \"The West Wing\" (as Agent Gina Toscano) and for the last seven seasons as Investigator Sara Sidle on CBS' \"CSI.\" Keep your eye out tonight for this single-but-involved, very vegetarian L.A. resident. She's featured in a \"CSI\" episode called \"Empty Eyes.\"\n\nA microbrew and a song\n\nOne of my favorite restaurants is within walking distance from my house, Blair's in Silver Lake. It's got a very bistro vibe, American contemporary cuisine and a fantastic wine list. The place is mostly candle-lit, and they play cool ambient jazz. The menu is seasonal and pulls a lot of stuff from the Pacific Northwest, so you'll find huckleberries, linden berries, freshwater fish. They do unbelievable things with side dishes; I love the cauliflower and braised Brussels sprouts, and the truffled mac &#8216;n' cheese.\n\nIf I was in the mood for a nightcap, there's a bar across the street called the Edendale Grill, which is a converted firehouse. They have a cool 40-foot-long bar, microbrews on tap and a lot of great martini drinks. There's usually a good crowd there long after the dinner hour; they attract a vibrant, late-night cocktail fan.\n\nI have a little karaoke machine in my living room, so that would be my final stop. I have a horrible voice -- I don't subject strangers to my singing -- but I will sing in front of friends for hours.\n\nHold the meat, please\n\nOn Saturday, I'll have brunch at the Brite Spot in Echo Park, a diner that's been around forever. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years -- I think I'm a lifer -- and they make vegetarian versions of anything, like a BLT or a meatloaf dinner. They have amazing spinach and tofu enchiladas and breakfast quesadillas with soy cheese.\n\nAfter that I'd go to a little place in Atwater Village called D-Tox Day Spa. It's small but beautiful. I'm not the type that can spend a whole day at a spa, but I'm good for the 80-minute Swedish massage. If I still have the energy, I'll get a pedicure. I don't bother with manicures, and, believe me, it shows.\n\nAfter that I'd take my dog, Ali, for a walk in Elysian Park. Or maybe go to Griffith Park and see the sunset from the observatory.\n\nDinner might be at Masa, a joint owned by two Chicago families. The place specializes in brick-oven pizza, both deep dish and thin crust, which you can order with soy cheese. They have veggie sausage sandwiches, and the niÃ§oise salad is out of this world.\n\nOn the way home I'd stop by the Short Stop, a great dive bar, for a Bailey's and decaf.\n\nDrumming up support\n\nOn Sunday I like to sleep late, then head out to the Brick House Cafe in Venice for brunch. Very casual, great coffee, and they have a lot of vegetarian options.\n\nThen I'd hit the beach and surf for a couple of hours. There's a huge drumming circle that I take part in sometimes, and it's great to do as the sun goes down. Sometime hundreds of people are playing. That's why I always bring my drum or a tambourine when I go to Venice.\n\nOn the way home, I'll head out to Tarzana, where there's a five-star vegan restaurant called Madeleine's, very healthy and flavorful. To cap off the weekend, I'd have a glass of organic wine with dinner.",

The CBS Entertainment chief brought back \"Jericho\" for a deserved midseason run and admitted that the \"Nuts to CBS\" campaign by fans was a factor in the show's survival. Now every Comic Book Guy and No. #1 Fan out there is managing a campaign to save their favorite canceled show or fired actor. Aside from \"Jericho\" and \"Cagney and Lacey\" back in the '80s, there's seldom any sign that these campaigns are effective. The latest - again aimed in Tassler's direction - is a fan campaign for Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle, a supporting character on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\"\n\nJorjaFox is leaving the show this season, reportedly due at least in part to a contract dispute with producers. (Remember the last time she and co-star George Eads demanded a raise, they came back with tails between their legs a few days later.) In addition to ditching the actress, the producers probably look forward to having Sara's boss, Gil Grissom, dating again. One of the pro-Fox groups has even been raising donations that provided a week's worth of flowers to Fox on the set, with messages accompanying each day's bouquet, such as \"If we had a flower for all the times you've made us smile, we would have a garden to walk in forever.\"\n\nRemember the famous \"Saturday Night Live\" skit with William Shatner at a \"Star Trek\" convention? Remember his advice to the gathered Trekkies, I mean, uh, Trekkers? \"Get a life, people!\"",

        "content": "\nThe CSIer talks about her website, her beliefs, and the possibility that CSI may lose fans because of Liev Schreiber\n\nJorja Fox is refreshingly forthright, until you ask her about upcoming CSI storylines. But as long as we don't, Fox is willing to talk about anything, including the possibility that fans may tune out while co-star William Petersen is gone from the forensic drama.\n\nTV Guide: Hey Jorja, how are you doing?\n\nJorja Fox: I'm great. Hey, sorry about the changes in my scheduling and everything.\n\nTVG: No, no, no. You're busy. You're on a hit TV show.\n\nJF: I'm on a crazy, chaotic, wonderful, dysfunctional show.\n\nTVG: Are you on a day off?\n\nJF: I'm actually shooting today, and I just got out of makeup.\n\nTVG: I checked out your website, and you are very passionate about PETA, clean air, human rights and hurricane relief, among other causes. Do you find you're able to use your celebrity status to get the word out?\n\nJF: I've had the website for quite awhile now, but it took me a couple of years to do something with it. There are already a bunch of fansites about me - put together by wonderful people - so I knew I didn't want to do that. I'm pretty opinionated on my website, and I don't hold back. The bulk of the site is about the Gulf states right now. I grew up in Florida, in hurricane country, so a lot of the songs and the commentary is still timely to what's going on in the Gulf coast.\n\nTVG: The music on the site is great.\n\nJF: Thanks! I'm pretty bad at updating the site though. I should be updating a least once a week, but I don't have the time.\n\nTVG: Well, let's talk about what's been keeping you so busy - CSI.\n\nJF: OK.\n\nTVG: Last summer, the big news was that ABC was putting Grey's Anatomy up against you guys, and the question was who would win the timeslot. Turns out that you're both doing quite well. But, can CSI handle the loss of William Petersen, if only for a few episodes?\n\nJF: That's going to be interesting, isn't it? I think Liev Schreiber, who is one of my favourite actors, really has the hardest job in TV in the last 20 years. Not only does he have to come in and fill the space that Billy Petersen is usually in, but he's got one show to grab everybody. And if he can't do that, it's a distinct possibility that viewers will change the channel for the next several weeks. The stories are set up to wrap around his character - he almost becomes the protagonist of the show - so I think there is a danger there. Now that's just a theory, that's not neccessarily going to be the reality. It's a tall order for him, though.\n\nTVG: Was it weird to have a new guy on the set?\n\nJF: For us it's always cool for us to have someone new to play off of. For him, I'm sure it was hard. Coming into an established show with a cast like ours - we have our own language and ways of communicating because we've been working together for so long. But for us, he came in with so much passion and enthusiasm, and so much excitement, he was contagious to be around.\n\nTVG: Was it frustrating, from an acting standpoint, to have the Gil and Sara romance come to a head, only to have Gil leave?\n\nJF: I think of Gil and Sara as a tango. It's slow, and has a tremendous amount of endurance. You haven't seen the end of Sara and Gil by any means. The idea is to let the dust settle a bit, but we're gearing up for some stuff at the end of the season that I hope the fans like. We could fall flat on our faces, but the writers are willing to take the risks.\n\nTVG: But, won't they be starting from square one again?\n\nJF: It will be a surprise. That's all I can say. [laughs]\n\nTVG: We saw a box get dropped off on Gil's desk in the episode in which he left. It looked like the same type of box that had the models inside that Ernie, the serial killer, used to make. But Ernie killed himself - who's sending the boxes?\n\nJF: Someone might have made a mistake, right? That box did look a lot like the ones that had the miniatures inside of them, didn't it? That's all I can say, other than in this season, storylines are all linked. In the past, we had self-contained episodes, but this season, everything kind of ties back together, so viewers have to pay attention.  \n",

        "content": "\nThe pros and cons on how last season's cliffhanger might end\n\nThe seventh season of \"CSI\" ended earlier this year with crime scene investigator Sara Sidle trapped under an overturned vintage muscle car, her hand twitching with faint signs of life. Back at the Las Vegas lab, Sara's boss and secret lover, Gil Grissom, finished his interrogation of a psychotic young cleaning woman who turned out to be the lab's season-long nemesis, the Miniature Killer.\n\nWhen the interview began, it seemed Grissom had the upper hand. He complimented and teased information from his unhinged suspect, using her serious daddy issues to manipulate her. In the end, however, Grissom realized that it was Miss Miniature Killer in charge. Grissom's confidence quickly evaporated when their cat-and-mouse conversation revealed that her latest victim was Sara.\n\nNo doubt, \"CSI's\" eighth season will begin with Grissom and crew frantically searching for their lost and dying co-worker. They'll meticulously comb through the only real clue to Sara's location, the perfectly constructed scale model of the crime scene, complete with model car and tiny motorized hand poking from underneath the wreckage. With the killer's obsessive attention to detail, viewers know this crack team can unearth leads. But whether they get to Sara in time is another question. And whether viewers even want Sara back alive is the biggest cliffhanger of all. \n\nIn the \"CSI\" (Original Recipe) chat rooms, hard-core fans battle over which fate for Sara is best -- for Grissom, the CSI crew and the show in general. Haters rail against both the Sara character and actress Jorja Fox. Many find her long-foreshadowed relationship with Grissom unbelievable or just plain icky. Meanwhile, many romantics find the couple's odd connection dreamy and divine, and want to see it explored. Others just don't want to see the Sara's quirky character disappear from the show. There are pros and cons on both sides of the argument. Here's what it could mean for \"CSI\" if Sara lives or she dies.\n\nSara lives!  \nPost-traumatic stress disorder would make Sara's already damaged character more interesting. When Sara first joined CSI, she entered the game with an already bent-up playing deck. Freakishly intelligent, Sara had a rough childhood (her mother killed her father) and graduated high school at 16, then went to Harvard. This could explain her difficulty fitting in with the rest of the CSI team. Plus, she has that authority problem when being told what to do by anyone other than Grissom. During the short period when Catherine was Sara's boss, the two had a major falling out.\n\nSara's character has been picked up for drunk driving, and a past collection of food delivery menus hints that she doesn't have much in the way of a social life (before she and Grissom hooked up, at least). Since Sara's not one for counseling, who knows how this life-threatening episode will twist her further? She could come out even more introverted, or change completely, embracing life and dressing in pastels (instead of blacks and grays).\n\nIt could be a bonding experience. Sara and Nick can bond over their mutual season-ending kidnapping/entrapment/near-death experiences in the line of duty. If Sara's predicament seems familiar, it's because the Quentin Tarantino-directed season five finale found CSI Nick Stokes buried alive by a vengeful father, facing a lack of oxygen, a swarm of fire ants and explosives before he was finally rescued by the crew. The Miniature Killer kidnapped and trapped Sara under a car to get back at Grissom for her father's death. Now that the two are members of what is, for now, an exclusive CSI club, they can bond and heal together, and maybe even make Grissom a little jealous.\n\nSara remains a rare female character in TV crime dramas. In an era where dumpy dude detectives are partnered with increasingly younger women who look more like models than detectives, Sara is a real treat. Yes, Sara is thin and not so old herself, but she dresses like a real person, her breasts are never spilling out of her police-issue vest, and often, her hair looks like it hasn't seen a brush in days. Sara is certainly more of a real person than any of the lab hotties found on \"CSI: Miami\" or \"CSI: New York.\"\n\nSara and Grissom make for great lab gossip. With Sara kidnapped, Grissom came out to the team about their secret love affair -- though it's not really clear why. Surely they would've believed that like Nick's kidnap/torture, taking Sara was just another hit on the department. Maybe he felt obligated, since the Miniature Killer went after Grissom's weird daddy's girl relationship because he wrecked hers. Whatever. Now that the cat's out of the bag, Hodges and the rest of the creepy lab techs will be abuzz. But nobody's going to want to gossip about it if Sara's dead. \n\nThere's something else for Grissom to brood over. If Sara lives, there's no way her relationship with Grissom can last. It's got that creepy daddy's girl vibe mentioned earlier, what with the decade-plus age difference. If that yuckiness doesn't do them in, no doubt upper management will want to put the kibosh on the affair. Even if their love isn't against office policy, neither Grissom nor Sara is any good at relationships. When Grissom was away on sabbatical, he didn't even e-mail. He claims he loves her in a letter he never sent, but it was all he could do to send Sara an old twig with a cocoon. This extra trauma will only create a further divide. Fans of the mopey Grissom, rejoice!\n\nSara dies!  \nSara goes from co-worker to work. Catherine, Nick, Warrick, Greg, et al., are known to yuck it up pretty good over a corpse or two, laughing at the expense of the deceased. Catherine couldn't contain her guffaws when they found a suspect caught in cement. Then there was Greg's line about the empty decapitated head he found: \"This one's a no-brainer.\" Of course, because this is television, the investigators won't be relieved from this investigation because of conflict of interest. Let's see how the team operates when they don't have black humor to help them through a horrible crime scene.\n\nMore Lady Heather! Yes, \"CSI\" has hinted at Grissom's age-inappropriate affection for Sara for years. When he couldn't deal with a corpse because it resembled his favorite underling, viewers knew for sure. But frankly, it's creepy. Grissom's true soul mate is erstwhile dominatrix Lady Heather. Alas, whenever she resurfaces, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the law -- kind of like Batman and Catwoman. Someday these crazy students of human behavior will figure it out. With Sara out of the way, it'll be that much easier for the star crossed lovers to do just that. \n\nNo Sara gives other characters room to grow. What happened with Warrick's gambling problem or the wife he married on the spur of the moment? Did long work hours destroy their short relationship? Did they work it out, or can he and Catherine finally hook up? What about Catherine's juvenile delinquent daughter? Will she turn just as bad as Det. Jim Brass's kid? How is Nick after his own kidnapping experience? Does he have nightmares? These are all plot lines left unfulfilled last year by writers focusing on the most forced TV pairing since Monica and Chandler on \"Friends.\" \n\nNo more Jorja Fox contract disputes. Back in 2004, Jorja Fox (Sara) and George Eads (Nick) didn't show up to work because they wanted to make more money. Instead, they were fired, then rehired with no raise. Rumor has it, Fox is doing it again and that's why Sara got thrown under the bus -- or the vintage muscle car. If Sara doesn't make it through, you can blame Fox's lousy management. At least we won't have to read about it any more.\n\nMore for Grissom to brood over. With his beloved Sara dead and gone, surely Grissom will be wracked with guilt. If only they hadn't been lovers, then the Miniature Killer wouldn't have taken Sara! Can Grissom ever love again? Will he ever work again? After all, the profession he loves lead to the loss of the woman he loves. Fans of mopey Grissom, rejoice! ",

        "content": "Jorja Fox's character valuable to show, and she's a role model, readers say\n\nIt's not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. But whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves âCSI's' Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama -- they're more concerned that the show will suffer without her.\n\n\"The reason âCSI' is great is because of the cast. Any one of their departure would affect the strength of the show,\" explained Matt from Alameda, Calif. \"Sara Sidle is vital to âCSI.' She brings humanity to the show, she always has. The cases in âCSI: Vegas,' âMiami,' âNew York' ... and oh so many crime shows are very similar, but âCSI: Vegas' as a show is different because they have a great chemistry among characters. A big chuck of it will be gone with Sara's loss.\"\n\n\"(The show) will be worse. She's the only one that seems like a genuine investigator or criminalist, apparently the romance between her and Grissom became their biggest ratings grabber (they're kinda cute anyway, so whatever, and we all know that when an important member of the cast leaves a show, the show is doomed, especially now that they've started lacking in the \"case\" department). And she's nice to look at, too,\" said Angel from Pembroke Pines, Fla.\n\n[...]\n\nI think it will be worse off. The character, besides being a good, if troubled role model was often the voice of humanity on the show. Grissom is portrayed as rather lacking in feeling and Willows is often shown as an oversexed woman who at times lacks discretion and good judgment. I wish Jorja Fox the best in what ever she goes on to do, but I hope that the writers at \"CSI\" don't think that the fans will be placated by the doe-y eyed Ronnie who seems as bright as a burnt-out bulb. It was nice to see a woman in science who didn't wear all white to a crime scene or heels to check out blood spatter. I hope they find a like-minded person to replace her or somehow entice her back to the show. --S.H., Wash.\n\nThe show will not be the same without Jorja Fox and her character of Sara Sidle. Sara Sidle is probably the most complex and emotive character on the show. Jorja's immense talent makes it so easy for the viewers to sympathize with the character, and I fear that without her the show will lose its heart and become a cold rock of boredom and mediocrity. --Joe, Irvine, Calif.\n\nI am very saddened by Ms. Fox's decision to leave \"CSI.\" She brings a humanity and grace to Sara that will be definitely lacking when she's gone. The heart of the show will be gone. Ms. Fox is an incredible actress. She and William Petersen share a chemistry that is not seen anywhere on television and they can say more with just a look than pages of dialogue ever could. If ever there were two characters that were destined to be together forever, it is Grissom and Sara. I wish Ms. Fox all the best in life and look forward to her return to \"CSI,\" as Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar have told us WILL happen. --Marti\n\nSara gave the show a realness. She is not as important as Grissom but she gave the team a good attitude. If Ronnie is suppose to be the new Sara, that sucks. Ronnie can't compare. I think it will change the show, I don't think better or worse just different. She had an attitude that added to the team. Each character added something and when you take away a part of the team it takes away from the strong feel of the show. --MF, Penn.\n\nI believe that the show will deplete without Sara Sidle. She adds realism, human compassion and laughter with her character. She will be totally missed and I hope she returns. Without Sara there is no Grissom. She makes Grissom human. --Maria, Mississauga, Ontario\n\nI have no intention to continue watching after Sara leaves. Actually I could accept that Sara was leaving to find a new job in Vegas, but the emotional breakdown that we are likely to see as her finale irritates me. I don't want to see a \"Dear Grissom\" letter or Sara fall to pieces. Sara deserves a happy ending, not a depressing, open-ended farewell. GSR is what has kept me watching this show, and now that one half is gone, it won't be the same for me. Everyone that wants to keep watching the procedural aspects of this show, good luck and enjoy. Farewell, \"CSI.\" --AK Wagner\n\nNo! Sara Sidle is a brilliant and important female figure on TV. Unlike so many other females on screen she doesn't show of her &#8216;assets' to gain attention nor is she like the plethora of vapid girls who have no identifable talent. Sara Sidle is an smart woman, graduating high school at 16 and financing her own way through Havard. She, like many, is socially akward and this means that thousands (even millions) of bright and shy girls (and boys) have a figure on TV with whom they can identify. Jorja Fox herself is an excellent role model who holds strong beliefs about animal cruelty, politics and prejudice. Why so many people seem to hate her is beyond me. It is a pity we are losing her from our screens especially as this nation becomes more obsessed with the fame and drug-crazed antics of people with significantly less talent. --Amy, Orlando, Fla.\n\nSara is the best female character on TV today. She's an intelligent, real woman with issues that define how she reacts to situations but not who she is. Sara's departure will leave a hole that is impossible to fill. I doubt \"CSI\" will continue to be as popular as it is. --Anonymous\n\nThe entire cast of CSI is important to the success of the show. Sara will definitely be missed as she adds so much that none of the other characters can offer. For those of us who like strong female role models that want to be taken seriously, she is the only person to relate to on the show. Catherine's sexuality and cleavage may have their place and I like her as well, but Sara adds balance. She's outspoken, strong, intelligent, relentless, and kind. She's a real woman (so to speak, I know she's a character) who actually succeeds in being taken seriously in a man's world. As a woman who couldn't find her feminine wiles if they slapped me in the face, I appreciate a woman who can be one of the boys. While I respect Jorja's decision to leave, she will certainly be missed. --Chelsea, Champaign, Ill.  \n",

        "content": "Readers dish on why Jorja Fox's departure from 'CSI' should be celebrated\n\nIn October, Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle on 'CSI' since the show premiered in 2000, told EW.com she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities \"before (she) gets too old.\" We asked readers to weigh in on her departure, and while some fans were upset over the seemingly definite demise of GSR, others were practically jubilant.\n\n\"I can't wait for it to happen,\" wrote Bob from Lewiston, N.Y. \"The pathetic character she played had no screen presence.\"\n\n\"YES! YES! YES!\" exclaimed Michelle of Smithville, Tenn. \"She is so overdramatic and whines so much about everything! They should have kept her dead when they had the chance. That would have been good TV and she would have left a martyr. Shows that kill off one of their main stars always have a revitalized audience.\" \n\n[...]\n\nI never really cared for Sara in the first place, so I have to say the show will be better. She's too hard to identify with and seems to have no personality whatsoever. Anybody who replaces her has got to be better. BTW, was that a baby bump I saw or just an ill-fitting shirt? --Mary, Norton, Kan.\n\nI don't think it will be either worse or better, just different. I really got creeped out thinking about her relationship with Grissom, though, so I guess I'm glad she's gone. Usually when two of the characters hook up, the show goes down the tubes. Look at \"moonlighting\" for an example. With the \"X-Files\" it was partially the tension between Scully and Mulder that kept the show interesting; it was really getting weird toward the end. --Sue, Brunswick, Md.\n\nSara Sidle is a cold, bitter, toxic, unfriendly character who does not generate one sliver of empathy or familiarity with the viewer. I want her to go so that someone else (anyone else) can get a chance to connect with the viewers. Grissom needs to get it on with Lady Heather. --Leona, Sarasota, Fla.\n\nI don't think that her departure will make a difference one way or the other. I like the idea of Grissom having a love interest, but I never felt he and Sara had any chemistry. Perhaps it's just Jorja Fox playing his love interest. I just don't buy it. --Kerri\n\nI never really cared for Sara in the first place, so I have to say the show will be better. She's too hard to identify with and seems to have no personality whatsoever. Anybody who replaces her has got to be better. --Mary, Norton, Kan.\n\nWhile I have nothing against Jorja Fox, I strongly dislike her character and I am looking forward to her departure. I believe the show will be improved drastically because of her departure, because the writers will no longer try to cram 30 seconds of Grissom/Sara \"romance\" into the show when those 30 seconds could be used to make the episodes intelligent and thought-provoking. Because of the Grissom/Sara pairing, the show has been reduced to a mindless, teen soap opera. I'm looking forward to the day when the show is returned to its former glory, without Sara Sidle being there to irritate me. --Linda, Ore.\n\nI think \"CSI\" will be better without Sara. I like Sara, I really do. However, I do not like the Grissom-Sara relationship. It seems that this relationship has taken over the show and it has become the Grissom-Sara show. With Sara gone, GSR will be a memory. Perhaps, maybe \"CSI\" will get back to the business of solving crimes rather than worrying about who's with who. --Nicole\n\nIt will be much better. Her character was ill-conceived for a CSI professional and was often extremely irritating. Her supposed empathy came off as emotional instability and her feistiness seemed more like passive-aggressive grandstanding. A personality like that would be poisonous in a workplace, but instead she got the big romantic buildup along with a lot of backstory that was just a plea for us to sympathize with her. It was a total failure. And forget the disgusting secret office romance with her long-time father-figure crush. Please let Grissom's character have a renaissance now that this albatross is not around his neck. --TR, New Jersey\n\nBetter, much better. I don't like to see professional relationships turn into romantic slush on a TV series, and I am very happy that we won't have to watch that happen on \"CSI.\" Fox's voice also annoyed me no end -- whiny, and full of Valley Girl inflections (every sentence ending on a rising note, as if it were a question). I'm so happy she's gone. I just hope she stays gone. I've read some TV gossip that says she might return. --Bonnie, Ocean Springs, Miss.\n\nYay! Until this season, Sara never really bothered me, but for some reason, she is really grating on my nerves now and I'm glad she is going. The whole relationship with Grissom was just plain icky! --Liz, Milwaukee, Wis.\n\n\"CSI\" has a strong cast and can withstand the loss of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). I've grown weary of her perma-sulk as she mopes through the department, voluntarily isolating herself, then staring longingly at everyone as they seem to gel around her. She comes off as a brilliant scientist with the social skills of a 7th grader with the way she scowls with jealousy at any female within 10 feet of Grissom that isn't Catherine and scowls at anyone who looks at Catherine more than at her. I'm over it -- and her. Time to move on. --Karen, Wisconsin  \n",

        "content": "\n'I'D WALK through fire for the &#8216;guys' I worked with on &#8216;CSI.' I could never be sick of them!\" says Jorja Fox, who has left the popular TV series.\n\nWhat happens when - after several seasons of making the TV-viewing public come to love and adore you, to feel they know you and, indeed, that they own you - you disappear of your own free will from their screens and their lives?\n\nSo I had a chance to offer this question to the actress on the very day tabloid TV was shouting things like \"Jorja disappears from &#8216;CSI' at last for good,\" or words to that effect. It was as if she had been banished from the magic kingdom.\n\nThe forensic investigator Sara Sidle in the original and best of all the \"CSI\" versions always showed her unique air of independence. She sometimes protested events, drank too much, slaved over evidence, and let her heart break for the victims. Now the real-life Jorja had decided to leave this big hit just as her character's rather odd TV romance with her boss, Grissom, played by the fine actor William Petersen, seemed to be really \"happening.\"\n\nSo how could Jorja do this to us? I was surprised when she entered the El Rio Grande restaurant for our chat. The star is slight, but very tall. In person, the actress is soft-spoken and not much like her \"CSI\" self. On the show, her character was always jousting with her fellows, arguing ethical questions but, obviously, listening attentively to Grissom, being taught, mentored, hectored and, yes - loved - by the sometimes enigmatic boss of the series. But in person, the actress seems shy, innocent and very young. I asked about her departure from the show after a long run.\n\n\"Well, I'm not leaving under a cloud. It is much harder for me to leave than to stay. Actually, I've been thinking about leaving for a year and a half. I had to get up the courage. Maybe I'm just having a midlife crisis. Maybe this will be the worst decision I ever make.\n\n\"You know, at first I thought I'd just do eight episodes. We were the little show in a crummy time slot chugging along. We started out on-air Friday nights - the kiss of death, I thought. So who knew? It became a fan phenomenon. The series worked for us because we were doing stories about new technologies happening right that moment. It made us feel smart. We wouldn't have been able to bring it off if we hadn't done it as a collective with the creator Anthony Zuiker and William Petersen. He [Petersen] likes to interact with the writers and know everything that's going on.\"\n\n&#8216;WILL I go back? Well, I hope to do fu ture episodes, depending on the storyline. Contrary to rumor, I never could be sick of those people. But I wanted to come back to New York, where I'd worked in the beginning; I hadn't been here in two years.\n\n\"Theater is one of my loves, so I'm open for that after 11Â½ years of working in prime-time TV, for &#8216;ER,' &#8216;The West Wing' and &#8216;CSI.' I've never been to college, and I think about that. But I kept putting it off, and I am also thinking about having a child, and that's really important. Also, I want to do a lot of traveling and surfing - two of my hobbies. Maybe the universe will get tired of me. I have a one-woman little play about Dusty Springfield opening Feb. 2 at the Renberg Theater in Hollywood. . . . My private life? Well, I have a boxer named Ali, and I couldn't get on without him - you can't live in Los Angeles without a dog.\"\n\nI \"don't\" think the universe will get tired of Jorja Fox, and we dyed-in-the-wool \"CSI\" fans (Las Vegas version) are really going to miss her.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "Watch tonight's \"CSI\" and you too will understand why Jorja Fox - Sara Sidle - quit.\n\nMurders, suicide, a drag and dump (whatever that is), woman with knife in back, pre-pubescent homicidal insanity...all within 44 minutes. You'd quit too. One wonders what kind of toll this takes on an intelligent sensitive actress like Fox - year after year of it. She told \"EW\" that she wanted to start a family, but starting families requires a certain frame of mind, and \"optimism\" has to be a basic minimum requirement â optimism about life, your life, and the life of your unborn children. How could Fox be optimistic in a role that almost certainly bled into her off-screen psyche? (And how could it not?) \"I spent almost my entire life with ghosts,\" she tells Grissom in her goodbye-and-good-luck note. Nice line, and given this role, accurate. Time to move on and more credit to Fox for having the courage to forsake a very good paycheck for doing so.\n\nAs \"CSI's\" go, tonight is merely average - which isn't to say it's bad, just merely average by \"CSI\" standards which would be high by anyone else's. The B, C and D stories almost don't matter here: The inevitability of her departure is etched into every scene and line, so the end comes as no surprise whatsoever (and of course everyone's known it's been coming for months anyway so no surprise was expected.) Even the episode title tips off the ending: \"Goodbye and Good Luck.\" It's dry with just a touch of hope. And of course Sara lives. Of course.\n\nThere's a flashback case here - fans will remember it well from last season, in the episode where the girl genius, Hannah West - Juliette Goglia of \"Joan of Arcadia\" - lies to save her brother, Marlon (Douglas Smith). The deranged duo is back, and poor little smart girl Hannah is up to her old tricks, plus she crawls right back into Sara's head and messes it all up again. There's no reason to go into any more detail, but the case is probably an appropriate one to end with because it serves to not only remind Sidle of her many ghosts but also of the fact that you can't really bury them - they just keep coming back to haunt you. I've got to say, this departure is hardly suffused with optimism or the aforementioned hope: Sidle goes off into the figurative sunset with the harsh neon glow of the Vegas strip reflecting off her achingly sober face. Will Sara find happiness? Will Jorja? One certainly hopes they both do.  \n",

        "content": "\nThe eighth season of \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" traverses a tense path that long-time fans of the show will find familiar: a race-against-time CSI team effort to find one of their own, left to die in the desert by a vengeful killer.\n\nLast time this happened, the intended victim was Nick (George Eads), buried alive - but eventually rescued - in an episode directed by Quentin Tarantino. This time, Nick is one of the team members using all his skills and instincts to help his colleague, Sara (Jorja Fox), escape a similar fate.\n\nTechnically, Sara escaped death once already. Her character was supposed to die in the very first episode, but test audiences responded so positively to Fox's performance that the producers decided to let Sara live. Sara also upped her status in last season's finale, when Grissom (William Petersen), upset by Sara's disappearance and apparent abduction, made public his affection for her.\n\nTonight, the questions posed are these:\n\nWill the \"miniature killer,\" whose identity was revealed in May as a female janitor who worked in the CSI lab, crack under interrogation and reveal the location where she \"posed\" Sara in a life-threatening tableau?\n\nWill the CSI team find her, when the only obvious clue is the serial killer's taunting miniature model showing that Sara is pinned under an overturned car somewhere in the desert?\n\nIf and when they find her, will she still be alive?\n\nFinally, how did the killer manage to arrange such a complex, creepy presentation in the first place?\n\nThe answer to the first question is a quick \"No\" - otherwise, there'd be no drama the rest of the hour.\n\nFor the other answers, watch for yourself. Facts are doled out slowly, but surely, in a clever narrative that intercuts the present (the search for Sara) with the past (how she was abducted and posed, and what happened next).\n\nThe flash-flood element of the story seems to come and go a bit too quickly, especially in visual terms, but the entire hour is paced so quickly, you hardly notice. It's a good start for a new season of \"CSI,\" the granddaddy and still quality champion of the \"CSI\" franchise.",

Her contract expired in May, and there's been speculation for months that she would exit the show.  \nFox was nearly fired in 2004 over a contract dispute.\n\nWord of her departure came just as CBS was celebrating big numbers for Thursday's telecast, which averaged 25.2 million viewers. A time-slot rival, ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" averaged 20.9 million.",

        "content": "Original \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" cast member Jorja Fox leaves the hit CBS drama Thursday night, but expect the series to be just fine without her.\n\n\"CSI,\" which debuted in 2000, has been the most-watched scripted show on TV for the past five years, and its audience isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"&#8216;CSI' has built its success over the years by being more story-driven than star-driven,\" Vincent Fitzgerald, who heads the communications department at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale, told the Daily News. \"Because of that, the show should be able to withstand the loss of one character without suffering in the ratings.\"\n\nFox had a history of butting heads with CBS brass over contract negotiations and was fired in 2004 before coming to an agreement with the network.\n\nAfter that, her status on the show was the source of rampant rumors up until she confirmed her departure last month.\n\n\"It's one of the hardest decisions I've made in my life,\" Fox told Entertainment Weekly. \"It has nothing to do with my contract, nothing to do with money. ... It could be the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Only time will tell.\"\n\nBut Fox does acknowledge one immediate perk: \"Now I can date my co-stars,\" she said Wednesday when she co-hosted \"The View.\"\n\nBecause she's one of the few women on the show, Fox's departure will certainly be noticed.\n\nBut history has shown that popular shows can survive, and often thrive, when a major cast member bolts.\n\nThere's the famed departure of David Caruso from \"NYPD Blue,\" for example. George Clooney left \"ER.\" And Mandy Patinkin left both \"Chicago Hope\" and \"Criminal Minds.\"\n\nAnd \"Law & Order\" has often made major cast changes.\n\nNone of those shows missed a beat.\n\n\"I'm not certain that anyone who doesn't watch &#8216;CSI,' if they're really familiar with any of the actors or actresses on the show,\" said Fitzgerald. \"I figure [William Petersen, who plays Gil Grissom] is probably the only person that might have an effect because this show really is geared around him. The other characters are more supporting in many ways, and television has shown over the years, repeatedly, that supporting characters can be replaced or eliminated.\"\n\nFox's final episode, \"Goodbye and Goodnight,\" airs tonight at 10, but it may not be the last time you see her in Sara Sidle's shoes.\n\n\"Let's just say if there is an opportunity to guest-star, I'd be thrilled,\" said Fox. \"It would be impossible to say definitely one way or another because the writers are still making that stuff up. I would never rule anything out. But I'm not trying to lead anybody on, either.\"  \n",

        "content": "CSI is a curiosity. Long before the popular procedural drama became TV's most-watched crime show, it bucked TV convention. CSI debuted on the same night and the same network as a slick, glossy remake of The Fugitive, one of TV's most respected and fondly remembered classics. The conventional wisdom was that The Fugitive remake, starring a dashing Tim Daly, would be a hit, and CSI would be lucky if it played out the string for a season or two.\n\nYou know the rest. Like so many episodes of CSI, you know how this story ends long before you get there.\n\nPopular doesn't always mean loved, though. CSI has rarely, if ever, been considered for any major awards. It's interesting, too, that though CSI does well in reruns, it does not do at all well on DVD. That suggests that CSI is the kind of show that people want to see at the end of a long, hard day, but they won't go out of their way to keep it in their home video library.\n\nCSI may leave a legacy that outlasts any award winner. Yes, it may be formulaic and obvious, but few networks are scrambling to rush out clones of award winners like The West Wing and The Sopranos. CSI's influence, good or bad, will live on long after it's gone.\n\nThat makes Jorja Fox's departure from the show &#8212; tonight's episode is her last &#8212; all the more curious.\n\nFox is not a particularly terrific actor. It's not as if a movie career beckons, and there are unlikely to be any calls for new TV series for the next while &#8212; or as long as the writers' strike lasts. Her character, crime-scene investigator Sarah Sidle, was something of a gift. In a show not noted for its breakout characters, Sidle provided one of CSI's few interesting story arcs in recent seasons, as she struck up a tentative relationship with her supervisor and mentor, lab boss Gil Grissom &#8212; played with genuine chops by Chicago stage actor William Petersen, who turned the movie world on its ear in the '80s in a couple of crime thrillers, Michael Mann's Manhunter, an early precursor of CSI, and William Friedkin's nervy chase thriller To Live and Die in L.A.\n\nIn tonight's farewell episode, the appropriately titled Goodbye & Good Luck, Sidle encounters a spectre from her past &#8212; an encounter that leaves her shaken and questioning her future on the job. You already know how it ends, but that's no different from any other CSI episode. Sarah Sidle always gets her man. It's just that, this time, she walks away at the end.

Just before hundreds of revelers arrived to imbibe in food and drink and watch Sierra Leone's Refugee All Stars, Planet Jackson Hole had a chance to walk across Q's grassy lawn and sit down with noted television actress Jorja Fox.\n\nFox got her break on the hit NBC show \"ER\" playing Dr. Maggie Doyle. For the last seven years, she has appeared as Sarah Sidle on \"CSI,\" CBS's flagship drama about forensic criminal investigators. Amid speculation that Fox is poised to leave the show (a rumor about which she is tight-lipped), the L.A.-based actress who has worked in independent film and founded a theater production company reflects on Jackson Hole, the future of film, vegetarianism and using her favorite spice.\n\nPlanet Jackson Hole: So, have you been to Jackson before?\n\nJorja Fox: The first time I stayed at the hostel. The second time I came I camped. I've been coming on and off for 12 years, and how cool is it that here I am, at this amazing festival, being invited to come, and you actually thought \"Oh, alright. I'll interview her.\" It's such an honor for me, I feel so honored because I have the deepest respect for this place.\n\nPJH: How do you feel about Steve Guttenberg? Do you know him?\n\nJF: [laughs] Personally, no. I hear he's a nice guy, though.\n\nPJH: You do live in L.A. now, right?\n\nJF: Yes, and proudly I must say. Coming from New York City, I couldn't really say that before. I love L.A. and feel really lucky to live there. You're a native after you've been there three years, by the way.\n\nPJH: That's not the case in Wyoming. How do you describe your upbringing? Was it all-American? A little eccentric?\n\nJF: I would definitely say I had an eccentric upbringing. I'm first generation American. My parents were from Montreal. I was born in New York City, but grew up in a very small town in central Florida. Kind of urban meets Bible Belt. \n\nPJH: Did your parents encourage you toward the arts?\n\nJF: Yeah, I was really lucky that way. My parents were a bit older. They were in the Depression. My dad was in WWII. My grandmother was in the house as well, and they were all extremely supportive. My mom wanted to be a painter, my dad wanted to be a writer, and my grandmother wanted to be a ballerina. But they had to put those ideas aside for more practical things like jobs...\n\nPJH: I hear that you're thinking about leaving [CBS's hit show] \"CSI.\"\n\nJF: All I can say is they don't call it a cliffhanger for nothing. So, everybody's just going to have to tune in in September and see what happens to poor Sarah Sidle, who's in a bit of a bind right now.\n\nPJH: What are you most interested in doing next?\n\nJF: For the most part my heart has been very much with \"CSI.\" I've been doing it for seven years, and it's been kind of hard to do anything but \"CSI,\" but I'm very grateful when I say that. If something's going to consume you for seven years of your life, for me I feel very lucky it was \"CSI,\" so I would love to be a producer when I grow up, and help people get their stories told. Probably not on TV, but maybe in the documentary film world, feature film world. I have a little theatre company in LA. We put up original plays.\n\nPJH: Are you a regular on the film festival circuit?\n\nJF: Not at all. For me, I feel somewhat uncomfortable going to a film festival if I don't have a real reason to go. I love film and L.A. has a great film festival and I go to  \nas many films there as I can. And I have been to Sundance with a film a couple of times. And I've been here and I was invited to be a juror at the event. The moment Jackson called, it wouldn't have mattered what you guys wanted, I would have been here with bells on.\n\nPJH: So what's your official role here, then?\n\nJF: I'm a judge for the Global Insight category. I was really hoping there was going to be at least a couple of clunkers in the category, and there really is not, so it's going to be a difficult decision.\n\nPHJ: How many films have you watched so far?\n\nJF: Eleven total.\n\nPJH: Both short and feature length?\n\nJF: Yeah, which was an interesting combination. About four shorts and the rest feature films. But the four shorts, you see, are so compelling that I see why they are in that category. I think they're hoping these are films people really would come out and see.\n\nIt might sound kind of hokey, but things are happening, and if you're paying taxes then you are paying for them to happen, so why not go and see the movie and be sure of what is happening, if you know what I mean. There is a film right now about torture and it's extremely profound, something I feel strongly about, and I think every American should see it so they know where their tax dollars are going.\n\nPJH: What trend or recurring theme do you see in a lot of these films that interests you?\n\nJF: I think the programming at this festival is really magnificent, and I think the organizers did a phenomenal job of bringing in different films â some of them very thought-provoking. I also think the action sports category is off-the-hook and exhilarating. There are some deep messages in that, but also you want the thrill of life.\n\nFor me, the most exciting thing happening right now in a lot of independent film in general is the Internet and the accessibility of people all over the world to get a camera and make a movie. I mean, every film here is a miracle. It's really hard to make a documentary or a feature and find the funding and take two or three years out of your life and make it happen. That to me is the most awesome thing about being here: the miracle of every piece of film that is here and the fact that these people did it and the fact that we're going to get together and build a community for a couple of days and see the films and talk about them and get to meet each other and talk about projects. That's really cool.\n\nBut in the larger picture, a kid from podunk Louisiana can get his hands on some equipment and make a film, and I think that is exhilarating.\n\nPJH: Final question: How do you as an animal activist and vegetarian, reconcile yourself with Wyoming, a place associated with game hunting and red meat consumption?\n\nJF: I have no issues with Wyoming whatsoever on that. I think, first and foremost for me, it's about conservation and environmentalism, and people just being aware. For me the vegetarianism is all interplayed and interwoven in the environmental idea. So in L.A., even where we have smog and population and overcrowding, [living as a vegetarian] is a really easy thing to do. If I was starving to death in the Arctic Circle, that might be a different story. It's a way I like to live my life, and I'm a pacifist, and it's another way to be a pacifist.\n\nPJH: What if, God forbid, you find yourself stranded in some rugged, remote place like the soccer team from the book and movie \"Alive,\" and you have to resort to cannibalism. But, your favorite spice is on-hand. Would you use that spice or sauce or whatever, or would you be ascetic about the whole ordeal and not use it?\n\nJF: Would I use the spice, of course I would!

Even while the festival was still in progress, we caught photos of television star Jorja Fox (\"ER,\" \"CSI\") on one of her major fansites, JorjaAllAround.com. In the photos, Fox was inexplicably dressed in khaki pants worn UNDERNEATH a pretty sundress, posing with Thora Birch, who looked like she had no idea how to stand in front of the \"red carpet\" camera.\n\n[...]",

        "content": "\nThe first thing that I notice about Jorja Fox is how quick she is to laugh. It's a little disarming, considering her character on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Sara Sidle, is not known for her jovial sense of humor. Disarming, yet infectious and even over the phone, its feels less like an interview and more like we're kicking back a few beers in a local pub and sharing stories. \n\nShe talks to PopGurls about the community on CSI, the Grissom/Sara relationship, Eric Szmanda's influence and being homeless in Europe at 17.\n\nYou've had strong female roles on three major television hits in the past decade -- Maggie Doyle on \"ER\", Agent Gina Toscano on \"The West Wing\" and now Sara Sidle on \"CSI\".\n\nI think I'm really fortunate -- especially when you talk about the three different characters. It occurred to me that maybe I was getting typecast, but then I thought -- if I am, how lucky am I? These women are all so smart, and specialists in a certain field. The character that had most training [was probably] Gina Toscano -- she was one of 200 people on the planet that knew how to do what she did. So that was really cool to play her. \n\nWhat have you learned from playing them?\n\nI definitely learned that having a gun on your side comes in handy. Even Maggie Doyle, who was a vegetarian on ''ER'', was a gun collector. Her big hobby was going shooting and collecting guns. All three characters have had something strapped to their legs (laughs). \n\nHave you taken a class in gun safety?\n\nNo! Isn't that funny? There's no requirements at all to carry a gun on television. (laughs). I personally don't own a gun. I have been to a shooting range a few times for different roles but I haven't done that in a while. There's a couple of gun ranges in L.A. and I thought it'd be fun on Saturday night to go shoot guns. But I haven't done it yet.\n\nDo they give you any lessons on how to properly hold a gun?\n\nYes. Certainly. I just did a scene yesterday where I had to draw my gun on ''CSI''. What's funny is that it's probably been two years since I've drawn my gun on ''CSI'' and every time I draw it, I have to learn over again exactly the proper way to hold it so it looks professional.\n\nI learn what I have to for the day and then I delete it all so I can get ready for the next day -- it's all in the short term memory. There's things that I've been doing for seven years that the tech advisor comes over and reminds me how to do it. \n\nLike what?\n\nWhen I have to tapelift, or fingerprint, I've got the hand motions down but there's still the ''exact'' way to do it. W're always trying to do it as realistically as possible. I've been fingerprinting for seven years and I still -- Our tech advisor right now is Larry Mitchell and he's a genius -- he'll come over and be like, \"hold your wrist a little more like you're painting,\" [and gives me] these little tips to make it look right.\n\nI don't have any science skills at all. None. It's really hilarious that I get to play this person every week. \n\nI was drawn into \"CSI\" not only for the writing and concept, but because all the characters are flawed. And I think you do a fantastic job portraying Sara as a strong, smart, flawed woman. How have you approached Sara? Has that changed over the past seasons?\n\nOh, thank you. Well, I have a lot of experience at being flawed, so it came in handy for once in my life (laughs). \n\nThis has been a great year for Sara. It's really rare that you get a Season Seven and it's hugely rarer that you can go into Season Seven with this brand new idea of a storyline. Grissom and Sara have been doing this tango for a long time but after the finale in Season Six, it really left people with the sense that not only is something is going on, but \"how long\" has this been going on. So it's really fun to have this new thing to play. Billy [Peterson, who plays Gil Grissom] and I thought that Sara and Grissom thing had been played out and that people were sick of it and wanted new storylines. I was really surprised to find out that there was space for it, that people would like to see what would happen between them. \n\nAfter we dropped the proverbial bomb at the end of last season, we decided to just let it breathe a little bit -- sort of like, \"well now you know, and here's what it looks like.\" It was a great first half of the year for them -- it was very pleasant and there wasn't a lot of tension, we just wanted the dust to settle. From here on out, there's going to be some interesting stuff that takes place between the two of them and I was really excited about it. \n\nAnd I kind of decided at the beginning of the year that, even though I was under the umbrella of \"CSI\" &#8212; I, personally, was in a romantic comedy. \n\nReally?\n\nYeah -- the fumbles of that and the ups and downs of that. Even though we don't talk about it much, it sort of colors every scene that we're in together now. They're always fun to play and I hope the fans like it certainly, but you never want to bore anybody with something like that. It's one thing if we bored people with our storylines, but to bore people with our characters' personal lives would be worse (laughs). I would have to take it more personally. \n\nOur writers our phenomenal -- every year it gets harder and more challenging for them to come up with stuff that's still our show, but at the same time, fresh and different enough to keep people surprised. After so many years, ''they'' have the hard job. I have to show up and try to bring it to life. So I really commend them, I think they're really doing a great job with that. \n\nThis episode I'm working on right now, it's episode 18 [\"[[Empty Eyes]]\"] -- I always think, \"man, they can't shock me any more\" and they gave me this episode 10 days ago and I was floored. How do they do it? I'm excited -- it's a real strong show for Sara. \n\n*Did the writers tell you how long Grissom and Sara have been together, or have you come up with your own history? *\n\nWay back when I got the first episode of CSI, [Sara] was defined as a love interest for Grissom. So it was natural from the very beginning for Billy and I to play this little bit because this was supposed to be the history of these two characters. And then everybody changed their minds for a while -- some people thought it worked, some people didn't think it worked. \n\nWe started to realize how lucky we were that we might be on the air for a little while and the writers decided that they wanted to hold off on that storyline for a little while because if you put those characters together and they get together -- where do you go from there? So [they decided], let's slow it down a little bit so we always have somewhere to go. \n\nAt the end of Season Six -- the final episode was written, we were already shooting it, it had an ending -- then Carol Mendelsohn, the Executive Producer of \"CSI\" called me at home and said, \"What do you think about this? I was talking with Billy and we just kind of decided that maybe we'd like to do this -- are you still interested?\" And I said, \"of course!\" It's kind of what I felt like I was hired to do way back in the day. \n\nI think we've got the whole year arced out now, but for a lot of it over the six or seven years, nobody knew where it was going or how long they've known each other. Luckily for us, since one of the big themes of our show is to follow the clues and unravel the mystery, it kind of works. (laughs) There's still holes -- like, how long have Sara and Grissom known each other? Where did they meet? Have they been together in the past? Were they together before and then they broke up and now they're back together? \n\nWill those questions be answered in upcoming episodes?\n\nI think there will be some answers, yeah. To me, again, that's part of the fun. If we gave the audience this new mystery -- since it's a suspense show, where people try to figure out the mystery, then it would be kind of cool to drop clues about that -- that would become part of the mystery of the show. I think we will here and there. \n\nBut all hell's about to break loose -- that I can say for sure. \n\nYou've said that the ''CSI'' writers and producers are really kind. That if there's someplace you don't really want to go with the character, you can talk to them, and generally they'll change the course or direction. When was a time that you brought up a path w/the producers that you didn't feel comfortable with for Sara?\n\nThere have been a couple of times over the years. The first one that comes to mind -- very early in the show, the writers had wanted to create a real solid tension between Catherine Willows and Sara Sidle. They started off right away that we would lock horns and that this would be a theme that would go throughout the show. Marg [Helgenberger, who plays Catherine] and I talked about it and we both felt that, since we were the only women on the show at that time, to have [us] fighting each other and jockeying for position was an area that we were hoping that [we didn't have] to go. We wanted actually to work well together -- we could still disagree on things from time to time. Certainly Sara and Catherine are very different people and they go about things differently but we didn't want to set a tone that would last throughout the show. We went to the writers and they were kind enough to pull back on that which was great. \n\nI felt more passionately about potential for camaraderie coming from these two women being so different instead of the opposite. They've done the opposite too -- several times, actors have gone in with story ideas that they were excited about and writers have gone and written that script. So they do that for us, too. I think it's quite rare on TV and it's a really wonderful thing. Sometimes we'll be on set and the writer will want one thing, the director will want one thing and the two actors in the scene will want different things and if we can go away and talk for a few minutes -- all four people come out with a great resolution which might be very different from what each person wanted individually so it's very exciting. \n\nThat seems very rare in television.\n\nI think so. Maybe because I've only been on one show for so long I don't really know how it's working in other places. But at least traditionally, from where I come from before getting ''CSI'', I had never worked collaboratively like that. That had a lot do with William Peterson and Carol Mendelsohn. Billy just said very plainly to CBS that the only way he knew how to work was collaboratively, from theater, and if he was going to take the job, those kind of guidelines would have to be put in place. \n\nThey've been amazing. There's a few shows that I've pitched that they haven't gone for yet, but I pitch them twice a year and hopefully some day (laughs). I'm relentless, I don't give up. I'm probably one of the most annoying actors on the show for that department. (laughs) \n\nThe good side to that is that after seven years, we're still into it. We still think about it. We still get excited about it -- and that's hopefully the goal. You'd rather have somebody knocking at your door at eight o'clock at night than actors never coming in and not caring. \n\nAnd from a fan perspective -- you want to see the actors be as passionate about the show that you're passionate about.\n\nYeah, thank you. You're absolutely right. I agree -- if we're bored, then everybody's bored for sure. \n\nWill there be a Season Eight of \"CSI\"?\n\nYeah, as far as I know, everybody will be back. \n\nIt's a big cast, do you spend time with people outside of work?\n\nIt's a big a cast -- there's 10 of us now, regulars. There's a few cast members that I see outside of work all the time. Even the folks that I don't -- maybe we don't live as close to each other -- they're my family. I adore them, I'd walk on glass for them. Every once in a while we'll have a fight, but it's like a family. The bulk of our crew has been around since Season Three, some since Season One. That's also extremely rare. \n\n*It sounds like you have a great community there. *\n\nYeah but it's scary though, when somebody comes to visit because we all know each other so well we're like \"Who's the new person? Somebody new to talk to!\" And they get ''mobbed'' by everybody. \"what's your name, where are you from?\" we love company (laughs). And we behave better when we have company!\n\nI saw that you and Fox and Eric Szmanda are members of the World Adult Kickball Association, playing for the Royal Blue Balls team. How did you get involved in that?\n\nHe dragged me into that! He put together a kick ball team with a couple of friends and it's a co-ed team and they desperately need women. Last season was our first season, and the kick-off for this season is [coming up]. We've been practicing and getting ready -- it's so much fun. \n\nEric would be one of the people that I see the most. Because of common interests like kickball. (laughs). \n\n*Do you have a nickname on the back of your jersey? *\n\nYeah, like \"batting last.\" I'm terrible. I'm negotiating for cheerleader this year. It would be a completely new thing for me -- I have no background in cheerleading. The team needs cheerleaders and it could be fun to do that at my age for the first time, but so far they won't let me but we'll see. \n\n*That would be great idea! You could come up with original cheers. *\n\nAnd a cheerleading outfit! I was not that kid in high school. I missed all that -- it just wasn't the crowd that I hung with. Neither was kickball, to be perfectly honest. I went to junior high and high school in a little town in Florida and there was the Football kids and the cheerleaders and there were the surfers and the skaters and I fell into the surfer category. \n\nFrom a few interviews, I've noticed that you're a fan of beer. What do you normally drink?\n\nOnce summer comes, I can drink anything I want. I love the microbrews. But when I'm working so much -- Heineken Light is the way to go. We all come back to work in July and we're still fit and by this time of year, some of us are barely hanging on to the same size jeans that we were in the beginning of the season. I go up a whole size -- well, my waist goes up a size and my shoulders go down a size because I surf. By winter, I'm a size smaller in a jacket, it's sad. \n\n*Is that pretty much what you do all summer long, go surfing? *\n\nYeah, I surf and I hike and I run. I've never been a gym person so the weather has a lot to do with my workout. If the sun is out until eight or nine o'clock, I can surf after work sometimes. But once it's dark at five, it makes it harder. I'm always trying to stay in shape but for me -- I'm one of those people that, if I'm really busy, it's one of the first things to fall off my list of things to do. But there's other people on the show that are a lot more disciplined than I am. Marg -- it doesn't matter if it's raining or sleeting or what -- she gets her workout in. I'm very impressed by that. \n--\n\nWhat is your favorite thing to do after you've finished shooting for the season?\n\nSleep. \n\nFor the last two years, Eric has dragged me -- again, dragged me -- to Coachella. It's a big music festival in California. I'd been a bunch of times and I hadn't been for a few years. I've had a really good time, but we were ''so'' tired by the time we stop. I've told him there's no way I'm going this year. I just want to turn the phone off and not do anything but sleep for four days. So that'll be what I'll try to do this year but he keeps sending me the line-up and every turn around, there's somebody else playing that I really want to see. I'll keep you posted!\n\nGoing back to ''The West Wing'' -- what was it like for you to be on the show?\n\nIt was amazing. The year was 2000 -- there was a presidential election. We had the Democratic National Convention in LA that year, and there was a warm, sort of friendly relationship between the Clinton administration and ''The West Wing''. So we were invited to go every night, we were invited to the White House Correspondents dinner in Clinton's last year. I got to go places and meet people that I would have ''never'' been able to meet and I felt so honored to be part of all that. \n\nI've always had a naÃ¯ve sense of romance about politics. I think it's interesting and what politicians do is really cool -- the idea of it, going to Washington to serve your area or state, your country. That's a very noble pursuit. It was really wonderful for me to be a part of all that, to hear Gore speak on the floor that year. At the time of the Democratic National Convention -- he was ahead by so much that everybody thought that we were seeing the future. It was a big shock to a lot of people when his numbers started to fall and there was that big debacle.\n\nWhen I left ''The West Wing'', I really thought I'd be back there because I thought that ''CSI'' would fall flat on its face. A show about death on a Friday night would never fly -- people wouldn't be interested in it. Aaron Sorkin never wrote off any of his characters. With the amount of characters on the show, and the amount of people coming and going -- he felt that's all he'd ever do was try to explain somebody's arrival and somebody's departure so for the most part characters would disappear into thin air. \n\nI Tivo'd the whole last season. I'm still making my way through [the episodes] -- I think they are phenomenal The way they brought back characters like [Sam Seaborn played by] Rob Lowe and how they tied [their returns] in. I think that [Sorkin] is one of the greatest writers that I've had the pleasure reading, let alone working with.\n--\n\nLast year, you were going to bring a play you were producing, \"Dear Bernard\", to London.\n\nUnfortunately, the play didn't go off. It happens -- that's showbiz, right? (laughs) I've produced eight plays and this would have been the ninth and this was the only one that we got deeply into pre-production and had to bail at the last minute. So it was a grand failure -- but we're still hoping to take the play somewhere. It has to be in the summer because of my job schedule. We're already trying to figure out where to put it up this year. I had a great time and London was very kind. It was definitely a learning experience and at the end of the day it was very sad. \n\nMy producer friends tell me that it happens all the time! If you want to be a producer when you grow up, you have to get used to it.\n\nHow do you enjoy producing?\n\nI \"love\" producing. Then again, I started off really small-scale and it's been exclusively theater until this year. I have an Associate Producer credit on a short film that's just submitting to festivals right now. The thing that I love is trying to help people get their story told. Somebody has an idea and just to physically try to make it happen. It's great. I really love it. \n\nYou've said that \"Dreams come true all the time\" -- what's a recent dream of yours that's come true?\n\nThere's been a couple. We break for two weeks in December and I spent the whole two weeks in Puerto Rico surfing. Growing up in Florida, there's a pretty big surf culture there, and there was this mythical place -- the west side of Puerto Rico -- where people talked about these mythical waves, and big waves. So it had always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid, to go there and surf, so that was great.\n\nYou started off in the entertainment world as a model. What's the craziest experience you had while modeling?\n\nThere were so many. (laughs) \n\nProbably one of the craziest things was that I had a modeling agent in New York City -- god bless him -- he sent me to Italy with another model and told us that we would start working right away. Our books were ready, he got us ready to go. I had brought 600 bucks with me at that time because I was supposed to start working right away. I think the girl that went with me brought, like, 250 dollars. And we got to Italy and they took one look at our books and said, \"these are awful, you have to start all over, these are never going to work here.\" \n\nThey told us what to do &#8212; we had to meet with different photographers that were really hip and happening in Milan and then make a book from there and they said that they could get us work. In the meantime, I think we spent eight or nine days in a pensione before the lady literally tossed us out on the street. So I was homeless in Milan, Italy at 17. Luckily, it was a situation where I met a guy from San Diego who was going to college in Milan for architecture. He was young too, he was 19. He had an apartment instead of a dorm. I met him on the street at an ice cream parlor and I lived with him for four weeks. It all worked out fine. But probably being homeless in Italy at 17 was pretty crazy. \n\nMy jaw is on the floor. I can't imagine what that was like.\n\nAt 17, it was fun and crazy. I probably could have called my parents &#8212; I didn't come from means but certainly they would have bailed me out. But I had this pride that I wasn't going to call them and tell them that I was failing in Italy. And also, I didn't want them to worry that I had become \"that\" destitute (laughs). So that was a highlight! \n\nIt had a very happy ending -- we both started working and we made money and we came home. There were two years when I got back from Europe that I was living in New York City going to acting classes and I didn't have to have a side job. \n\nWhen did you realize that you had some sort of fame?\n\nOh, wow. I'm still realizing that. I blend pretty well -- definitely better than other cast members on the show. But I'm under the impression that I can go in and out of places and people won't notice me. \n\nI think it was \"ER\" for sure. When I got the job on \"ER\", it was Season Three, they were the number one show in the world. When I got the job, I almost got in my car and drove to Mexico. I was supposed to start the next morning. And even though I didn't really watch \"ER\", I realized that when my first show aired that everyone would know what an imposter I was. It was a make it or break it moment. The world was going to see what I was doing. It's one thing to creep along, to get a pilot here and a pilot there -- it's another to all of a sudden be on the number one show in the world. I was \"terrified\". \n\nI've been lucky because it's been a slow, steady crawl for me. I have friends that one day, they're completely anonymous and literally, a week later, everyone knows who they are. I think that would be psychologically confusing. Much more so than the way I've been able to do it. \n\nThe biggest thing for me now is that people know my name. For years, people would say \"Oh, you're the girl from \"CSI!\" I love Sara, Sara's great!\" But now, I'll be walking down the street and people will go, \"Jorja!\" I have to stand there for a minute -- do I actually know this person? Because they know who I am. Your first assumption is that, well if somebody is calling you by your first name, you must know them. But more and more, it's people that I've never met -- they just know who I am.\n\nWow, I've never thought about that before. How surreal it must be to have someone call out to you, by name, that you don't know.\n\nAnd it's embarrassing every once in a while &#8212; when it happens with somebody who really knows me, and I think I don't know them. Like, we went to yoga class together four years ago. \n\nFor me, it's been a good thing -- it's a friendly world. People are nice to me wherever I go. It's really been a positive thing for me.\n",

        "content": "\nNumber one all around the world, CSI is apparently still at the top of its game. One could be forgiven for thinking that after seven seasons and two spin-offs, the genre would have completely lost steam, but that's not taking into account the talent of the writers and the quality of the actors. We went to talk to the team behind the show to find out what they have in store for us in Season seven and how the show has managed to remain as fresh as ever.\n\nA few months ago at the CBS Season seven premiere we were able to meet the CSI team : Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), Gary Dourdan (Warrick), George Eads (Nick), Jorja Fox (Sara), Eric Szmanda (Greg), Robert David Hall (Dr Al Robbins), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Brass), Carol Mendelsohn (Executive Producer) and Naren Shankar (Executive Producer).\n\n[...]\n\n\"There has been for a very long time hints of some history or special chemistry between Grissom and Sara...\"\n\nJORJA FOX: Not in the pilot because I wasn't there from the very first episode. Yeah, the character of Sara Sidle was described, in the very brief description given out before the auditions, as Grissom's eventual love interest. There were also a few other strange bits of information, like the fact that she could hold alcohol better than anyone and some mention of sociability problems. I was very intrigued by that and prepared myself for the day the relationship would become reality. Lots of little hints dropped here and there through the series have led up to it. The coolest part if the way the affair is revealed at the end of the season. It was ingenious of the writers, because we see the characters together, but we don't know how long they've been together. It was brilliantly executed. It's going to open up lots of ideas for the characters.\n\n\"In what state of mind were you before playing the scene between your character and Grissom?\"\n\nJORJA FOX: I was very enthusiastic. It's also quite frightening because there is a certain comfort in doing a procedural. One of the most beautiful gifts of this show is that at the end of seven years, there are still as many personal stories to tell about each one. It's rare, after so long, to continue to want to know more about the characters. It's very motivating.\n\n[...]\n\n\"Did you expect the impassioned reactions of the audience to the relevance of this scene?\"\n\nNAREN SHANKAR: I don't know if it was a surprise but it was gratifying. When people have such strong feelings, it's a measure of their interest in the show, so it was really very pleasant.\n\nCAROL MENDELSOHN: When I came back to work on the new season, I found on my desk a huge pile of letters from fans all around the world. I was told that the viewers were divided, that 60% approved of Sara and Grissom being together and 40% did not. The fans were delighted to see two adults, two professionals who were excellent in their work, find each other and engage in a serious and romantic relationship that isn't sordid... You don't see them tearing at each other's clothes.\n\nJORJA FOX: No, that's for next year! (Laughs) Thats why Billy and I have been working out at the gym all summer! (Laughs)\n\n\"Since we're on that topic, are there other characters who are together without anyone knowing about it?\"\n\nJORJA FOX: No, for the moment, at the start of Season seven it's only Grissom and Sara, as our delightful (beautiful) audience knows well. One of the most amusing things about doing a series for such a long time, is that new stories that you haven't ever thought of, crop up. Gary never thought he'd be married, nor did George think he'd spend 48 hours in a box. The writers and producers are very generous. If there is something that we don't want to do or that bothers us, generally, they'll change it. They also invite ideas from us which will really be included in the show. That's cool. We never know how things will go in the years to come, and that's the fun part.\n\n[...]\n",

        "content": "When I finally sat down to watch an advance copy of tonight's CSI showing the exit of fan protest magnet Jorja Fox, I couldn't help thinking of Devon Pierce.\n\nIf you're a regular blog reader, you know I wrote about Pierce weeks ago, outlining her efforts from a room in her father's Dunedin hearing aid clinic to run a massive fan effort aimed at convincing CSI producers to keep Fox's Sara Sidle character on the show.\n\nNow, her friendship with CSI's writers have led Pierce to turn her prodigious talents to supporting the Writer's Guild of America in their strike. Fans organized through her site have sent food to picketers, flown planes overhead with supportive banners and encouraged fans to join writers on the picket line at Universal studios in Los Angeles tomorrow.\n\nDespite all the fan furor, Fox and CSI producers eventually admitted that Sidle would be written out of the show, and tonight's episode is her last. And even though I've never liked the CSI franchise much, I made a point of watching this episode, convinced by fans like Devon to take another look at the series.\n\nAs you'll see in this review I wrote for today's paper, I found watching CSI episodes comparable to getting random pokes from a tiny acupuncture needle; jabs delivered every time something totally outlandish happens onscreen.\n\nWhich meant watching this week's episode went down like this: I see Fox's Sara Sidle and another CSI tech are the first cops called to a crime scene by a nervous patrolman investigating a possible missing woman â no detectives or backup in sight. \"Jab!\"\n\nAfter the abusive husband shows up and freaks out, the tech hanging with Sidle wonders \"How are we going to handle this?...He's obviously abusing her,\" forgetting that, as a CSI tech, her job basically is to collect evidence. \"Poke!\"\n\nEvidence in another murder leads to a 12-year-old forensics genius who attended Harvard and helped her brother beat a previous murder rap by manufacturing evidence. \"Stab!\"\n\nIt's a tribute to the show's feature film-level production values that such storytelling whoppers go down so easily. Tonight's episode opens with a shot peeking inside several levels of a busy college dorm, rushing through a window to capture a girl plunging to her death in a fatal fall.\n\nSince this is one of the most popular shows on TV, I know fans have already come to terms with the show's biggest disconnect; that people who gather evidence at crime scenes are also shown interviewing suspects and solving crimes on their own. Like, um, detectives.\n\nStill, as an occasional viewer, it feels odd watching Fox's Sidle do so much: matching wits with her tween nemesis in a showdown which seems increasingly absurd, mostly because the characters take it so seriously. Drenched in shadow and creative camera angles, the visuals spark drama the text can't match, especially when the villain seems better suited to a bit part on a Disney Channel comedy.\n\nConsidering that she recently survived a serial killer's attack, we're hardly surprised that an increasingly distant Sidle decides to walk away from the CSI unit to pull her life together.\n\nFans tried sending CBS everything from airplane banners to cash-filled envelopes to stop it. And the actress' departure is open-ended enough to allow a return â presuming the Hollywood writers' strike and Fox's problems with CBS are resolved â which may leave diehard supporters feeling a little victorious.\n\nThis casual viewer mostly felt disappointed. In the same way Sidle slips out of the CSI unit with little fanfare, producers eased Fox out of their rotation with an uninspired episode which most makes you happy this downer of a character is out the door.\n\nI know I'm a newcomer to this party. But even I figure Sara deserved better.  \n",

        "content": "A Dunedin woman is rallying the troops online to keep Jorja Fox on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\"\n\nDUNEDIN - Swathed in yellow crime scene tape, a large pegboard features the fruits of Devon Pierce's work. One flier pleads \"Don't burst our bubble. Keep Jorja Fox on \"CSI\".\" Another promises it is \"saving Sara one dollar at a time.\" A note of thanks from Fox - a 39-year-old ex-Floridian who has played forensic investigator Sara Sidle since the hit crime drama \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" debuted in fall 2000 - compliments Pierce and her friends for their devotion.\n\nFrom a tiny makeshift war room tucked inside her father's clinic and hearing aid service center on Main Street, the 30-year-old wages a campaign to bolster the career of an actor she has never met, who probably makes more in a week than she earns in a year.\n\nShe wants to keep Sara Sidle on \"CSI\".\n\n\"To me, it's a little bit inspiring that people can come together and work on something that doesn't have dire consequences,\" said Pierce, who founded the online bulletin board for crime TV fans, Your Tax Dollars at Work (www.yourtaxdollarsatwork.org, with a friend from her Dunedin living room five years ago. \"It's kind of crazy, I'm the first one to admit it. But it's a good kind of crazy.\"\n\nJust how crazy? Since last month, Pierce and some of the nearly 19,000 registered members of her site have collected more than $8,500 for gifts and stunts aimed at \"CSI\" producers and CBS executives, hoping to counter the increasingly accepted rumor that Fox's character will be written out of the series.\n\nThe group has paid a pilot to fly over the Los Angeles studios where \"CSI\" is filmed, towing banners with messages such as \"Follow the evidence - Keep Jorja Fox on CSI.\" They've also started the \"Dollars for Sense\" campaign, in which fans take a $1 bill, fold it in the \"one dollar at a time\" flier, and send it to CBS offices in Los Angeles and New York.\n\nAt press time, according to the site's running tally, fans have mailed about 20,000 fliers to CBS offices (Pierce said the network will donate the cash to charity). Fans also have sent bunches of balloons and boxes of bandages (slogan: \"You wound us. Keep Jorja Fox on \"CSI\"\").\n\nToo little, too late?\n\nLast week, Pierce traded-mails with friends to plan their most ambitious stunt yet: drafting a marching band to play \"Georgia on My Mind\" at one of CBS's offices (the Melbourne Beach-raised actor's first name is pronounced like the state name).\n\nFans post messages on the bulletin board each day, proposing stunts and ways to make them reality. \"We don't want CBS to lose sight of the fact that all these fans really care,\" Pierce said.\n\nThe power of such new media fandom can bring swift results. Back in May, disgruntled fans of CBS's post-apocalyptic drama \"Jericho\" persuaded the network to rescind its decision to cancel the show by sending tons of peanuts to executives, referencing a key line from the series.\n\nThat example has proved to be an inspiration and benchmark for Pierce and her crew, who promise to trump the \"Jericho\" protest with bigger, bolder ideas.\n\nThe problem: All this effort may have come too late.\n\nRepresentatives of CBS and Fox won't comment on whether the actor is leaving the show, citing the need to avoid spoiling upcoming episodes. \"The fans. . . &#8216;heart' Jorja Fox and so does everyone at \"CSI\" . . . although we've stopped short of sending her chocolate-dipped insects and cases of Lifesavers,\" wrote CSI executive producer Carol Mendelsohn in an e-mail to the St. Petersburg Times. \"Sara Sidle will always be a part of \"CSI\".\"\n\nBut \"TV Guide\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazines have reported that Fox is leaving at the end of her contract. Fox and castmate George Eads were fired briefly in 2004, amid tough contract negotiations.\n\nEven though the actors and CBS blamed it all on communication mixups, strained feelings remained. Fox has told TV Guide she turned down a raise that would have extended her contract through the entire season.\n\n\"TV Guide\" reported her last episode is now set to air Nov. 8.\n\n\"I was feeling a little hurt and angry by some of the events that happened a couple of years ago that relate to the firing of myself and George Eads,\" Fox told \"TV Guide\" earlier this year. \"The raise was terrible, to be frank. An extra year for that amount of money? No thank you.\"\n\nPierce sifts through Fox's vague statements in various interviews as if sorting tea leaves, hopeful that the final decision is not yet made, or can be undone if fans show enough devotion. \"We kind of have to go on faith,\" she said. \"If Jorja goes public and says she doesn't want to be on the show, we'll stop.\"\n\nOf course, some fans aren't sure they want Fox to stay on the show. The romance between star William Petersen's Gil Grissom and Fox's Sidle has always been controversial - even the actors are 15 years apart.\n\nAnd Sidle's survival of a serial killer's attack this season after a kidnapping, beating, near-drowning and life-threatening trek through the Nevada desert led one letter writer to tell TV Guide \"I actually found myself cheering for Sara to die, already.\"\n\n\"Getting involved\"\n\nStill, Pierce thrives on the unique community she has helped create.\n\nA user known as Committed wrote Oct. 8: \"I'm shamelessly getting two of my kids involved in this campaign. . . . My 5-year-old picked up a cell phone and pretended to make a call; she said, &#8216;Hello, I don't want Sara to go.' . . . Should I worry that I'm dragging my young children down into my obsession?\"\n\n\"You become wrapped up in the characters . . . (and) it wouldn't be the same if you couldn't talk about it,\" said Andrea Dawkins, a 25-year-old computer programmer who helped Pierce build the Web site from her Raleigh, N.C., home. \"Pretty much everyone knows Jorja Fox is leaving the show. But it makes people feel better that they're speaking out . . . letting CBS know this isn't going by unnoticed.\"\n\n\"Lots of company\"\n\nIn her office, surrounded by fliers and notes, Pierce seems both proud and a bit embarrassed by her group's effort.\n\nIt's not as if she doesn't have a life: A part-time employee at a Holiday Inn Express, Pierce is also mother to 5-month-old Nathaniel and wife to very understanding Steven, a dispatcher for Dell computers.\n\nSince spending about $1,200 to start the crime TV Web site - a fan has since donated a dedicated server to house the bulletin board, curbing costs - Pierce estimates she has spent up to $30,000 pursuing her unique hobby.\n\nTold that some readers are going to conclude she's a little nutty - spending hours each day protesting for a TV show with a husband and young child at home - Pierce smiles. \"There's a thin line between crazy and committed,\" she said, quoting a phrase taped to the door of her makeshift office. \"And if I'm crazy, there's 19,000 other people who are crazy with me.\"\n\nThe kicker: Though Pierce has visited with fellow fans in Las Vegas and stopped by the set of now-canceled CBS drama \"Joan of Arcadia\", she has never visited the \"CSI\" set, nor met any actors from the show, Fox included.\n\nFor her, the protest and its result may be secondary; the real reward comes from the thrill of bonding with others to tackle a challenging cause.\n\n\"It's been such a great aspect of my life, and that has nothing to do with the TV show,\" Pierce said. \"After this is all over, so many of us will still be friends.\"  \n",

But, the insider says, when Fox got wind of their plans, she refused to film Sara's pivotal death scene in the season finale.\n\n\"Jorja demanded a major raise over her $100,000-per episode salary,\" according to the source. \"CBS offered a moderate raise, but far from the doubling of salary she was hoping fore.\" When Fox balked, the source says \"CSI\" decided to say \"Sayonara, Sara!\"\n\nAWOL ACTRESS\n\n Diva Deja Vu: Fox's First Firing!\n  \nJorja and George Eads were kicked off the show in 2004 during a salary dispute, but ended up crawling back &#8212; without a raise. \"There comes a point where we feel a contract is a contract,\" CBS boss Les Moonves said at the time.\n\n\"They decided to kill off her character in the final episode being shot in late April,\" the insider explains. \"She was ordered to the Las Vegas location to film the death scene. It was to be very grisly, with her character being run over by a car. She was meant to twitch and die, crushed by the weight of the car.\"\n\nBut rather than be part of her character's gruesome demise, the source says, Fox went AWOL! \"Apparently Jorja didn't want to cooperate in the bloody end of Sara Sidle, so she simply didn't show,\" the insider shares. \"It was absolute chaos.\"\n\nWith the actress unavailable for the episode's final scenes, \"CSI\"\"s producers huddled to craft an alternate ending. \"They were filming in Las Vegas over a weekend, so it was very difficult,\" the source continues. \"With a full crew standing by, the cost was staggering.\n\n\"Producers made emergency calls to writers,\" says the source. \"[Star] Marg Helgenberger had to be flown in from Los Angeles to Vegas. Wardrobe and makeup people had to scramble to get the appropriate costumes together.\"\n\n\"It was a miracle they pulled it off.

[...]\n\nSTAYING ALIVE\nFox's latest mutiny will likely not be forgiven, according to the insider. \"The network and the producer are fed up,\" says the source. CBS declined to comment on this story, but Fox's rep denies the actress made any additional salary demands. \"She did not demand a raise. Her contract is up, and they are in conversations, but it has yet to be determined if she will be back next season,\" says the rep. \"The season finale is open-ended. She filmed it, which you will see when it airs.\"\n\nIndeed, the set source says Fox did film some scenes for the finale, set to air May 17, regarding Sara's relationship with **William Petersen\"\"s character, Gil Grissom. but the only reason the show is a cliffhanger, the source claims, is because Jorja didn't show up to get killed!",

For the moment at least.\"\n\n\"It could be the biggest mistake of my life. Only time will tell.\" It is with these words that Jorja Fox commented on her last appearance in the show \"CSI\" that millions of Americans will watch this coming November. But why has she chosen to leave the program that has made her famous? Jorja explains it to the press. It was not a matter of money, nor of significant disagreement with the production, like in 2004 when she was \"fired\", and then re-hired soon after.\n\n\"There are so many things that I want to do before I get too old!\" More than anything else, Jorja confesses she wanted to escape from the underlying violence of the show: \"All the scripts have a bad ending. This is what makes each shooting difficult.\" But it has not been an easy decision to make. \"We started to talk about it with the CBS last January. Everything was finalised in June.\"\n\n\"A return as guest-star?\"\n\nSo, in April, when Jorja shoots the last episode of season 7, the script leaves her between life and death after a car accident. \"I, also, didn't know what was going to happen to me before receiving the following script.\" It is eventually seven episodes later that Jorja leaves the show, at the same moment when, ironically, the love story between Grissom (William Petersen) and her character takes a happy turn. But won't spoil you any more. Should we conclude that Sarah will never return? \"Let's say that the way the story is written allows me to come back as a guest-star!\" A piece of information passed on by the executive producer of the show, Carol Medelsohn, who appears concerned not to disappoint the fans of the character: \"Grissom is not done with Sara.\" In the meantime, Jorja, herself, has personal projects: \"It could be traveling around the world, going to surf to the Southern hemisphere and having children!\"\n\n",

        "content": "\"Wouldn't you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?\"\n\n\"I don't even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.\"\n\nWith this brief interchange, crime scene investigator Sara Sidle made her first appearance on the CBS hit show, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Yesterday, she made her final appearance. After a tumultuous seven years on the show, actress Jorja Fox finally packed up her fingerprint kit.\n\nFox enjoyed a long run of success with the show as a materials and element analysis specialist who was originally brought in during the first season by Gil Grissom (actor William Petersen) to do an internal affairs investigation. Sidle ended up staying in Las Vegas for the next seven years (give or take a few episodes in season eight), developing close friendships with her team members and a romantic relationship in season five with Grissom.\n\nPrior to last night's episode, Sidle had been kidnapped by the \"Miniature Killer\" as a terrifying message to Grissom, nearly killed, and saved with only dehydration and a broken arm as testament to her story.\n\nSince then, Sara has been in the background as the season continues. I thought this was strange as she's my favorite CSI character (after all, I played her in Rocky Horror last year!) and her absence did not go unnoticed. Originally, I believed her absence to be due to the shift change which she had to do because of her relationship with Grissom, as the show centers on the grave shift. Only after I read the article in Entertainment Weekly did I understand what was happening. Sara was being phased out.\n\nGrissom's proposal three weeks ago struck viewers as untimely if the lanky brunette was truly going leave the show. Maybe she would stay. Maybe this was a publicity stunt like when co-star George Eades (Nick Stokes on CSI) and her were fired by CBS for three days. But last night, it happened. Jorja Fox officially vacated her role as Sara Sidle.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to warn all readers of spoilers ahead, so please if you don't want to know what happened yet, stop reading. I sat on my bed, anticipating what was about to come on my television screen at 9 pm sharp. It began with a knife cutting the threads which held Sara's name badge to her CSI vest and the aforementioned character holding the blade, slicing her own name off of the fabric. The scenes with Sara were intercut with the \"main\" case of the episode, Catherine and Nick's defenestration. It was a little disappointing, since on her last episode, she should be the center of attention.\n\nSara's dialogue in the first half hour was contrived, clichÃ©d, and to be quite honest, a little boring. Thankfully, she woke up and began to speak normally when she got into the case. The major twist in the episode was the reappearance of former sibling suspects Marlon and Hannah West from the season six episode, \"The Unusual Suspect\" in Catherine's case. Sara demands to take over the case, as the original one from season six had haunted her since then. Needless to say, what Sara discovered further pushed her to resign from the crime lab.\n\nI can't stress enough how annoying the little hints that the writers dropped within the episode of Sara's departure were. One of Hannah's lines, which ran, \"What's wrong, Sara? You're different then you used to be,\" was only one of the obvious moments. Others were extreme close-ups on Sara in times of high emotion and even one of her own lines when she said that the CSIs would be back to collect the bodies of an abusive couple within a month because there's nothing they could do to change things.\n\nSadly, Jorja's last performance as Sara Sidle seemed very unnatural and the whole episode was not up to the usual standard of the show. However, at least they gave Jorja what she said wanted in an interview three years ago. She kissed William Petersen on the show. Ah, I love those moments. After this touching moment, the show cut back to the beginning of the episode with the removal of her name tag. She wrote \"good luck\" on her vest where here name previously was, and threw the tag away. And then she left, leaving Grissom a note telling him how much she loves him but that she was leaving Las Vegas via voice over.\n\nAt least they didn't kill her off like previous characters. This writer wishes Jorja good luck in her future endeavors and hopes that she'll avoid the David Caruso post-NYPD Blues curse. And maybe, she'll return to CSI someday, even if it's only as a cameo.  \n",

        "content": "It became official on Monday, when Jorja Fox, who plays the recovering alcoholic Sara Sidle on the still-enormously popular CBS crime show, CSI, confirmed to ew.com that she is leaving the show this fall.\n\nThere had been much speculation in the TV press that Fox was quitting in this, the show's eighth season. Last season's glimpses of Sara's and Grissom's personal lives (they are a couple) led close followers to believe that Sara was doomed as a character, as no love goes unpunished on this show.\n\nLast year's cliff-hanger finale in which Sara disappeared, and this season's premiere in which they wrapped up the miniature serial killer storyline, saw Gil confessing his love for Sara to the rest of the CSI gang. Then came the internal investigation, yada, yada, yada.\n\nFox told ew.com that she wrapped production last week, and will appear in five more episodes, ending her run in mid-November. \n\n\"There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old,\" she is quoted as saying. \"If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would have tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like its going to be around for a while, so if I don't want some of those dreams to pass me by. I have to get off the ride for a while.\"\n\nThis got me thinking about other actors who jumped ship from successful shows.\n\n[...]  \n",

Just as the crimes become more intense, the sexual and emotional attraction between team leader Gil Grissom and the freckled Sara Sidle brews under the covers.\n\nFans of the series were teased with an intimate bedroom scene of the two in last season's cliffhanger finale.\n\nThis time, you will see the two let their relationship develop further under the radar of their sharp CSI colleagues.\n\nThis should be a fun subplot to follow, as it would be a secret that only viewers will be aware of.\n\n[...]\n\nWait &#8212; secret lover and workaholic Grissom goes on leave?

I don't know how often actors get those calls.\n\nI was surprised and intrigued.\n\nI thought it could make season seven very interesting.\n\nI always loved the storyline between Grissom and Sara; it's a bit scandalous and untraditional.\n\nWe are still trying to find the road that we are going to take on that storyline.\"\n\nA secret affair must be frustrating.\n\n\"I think Sara wonders why it's still a secret, because it's not like they started sleeping together two weeks ago,\" said Fox.\n\n\"There's motivation that if people knew they were together, they should switch shifts because he is her supervisor.\n\nOne of the things they feel very passionate about is the work and they love working together.\n\n\"The first part of the season for Sara and Grissom was letting the dust settle.\n\nWe had dropped this proverbial bomb and the fans were in on something that the characters were not and we wanted to let that play out and breathe for a while.\n\nThe second half of the season might be about the paradise lost between the two of them.\"\n\nA secret affair usually ceases to be a secret sooner or later, especially with the CSI's closed-knit relations, the other team members would surely sniff the \"closeness\" between those two eventually? \"Grissom is self-contained and seemingly socially-inept,\" said Petersen.\n\n\"I think of this as a choice as opposed to a flaw.\n\nPeople are constantly wondering about his passions and his humanness.\n\nHe's very close to the chest.\n\nIt becomes a puzzle in and of itself.\n\nOur audience is also challenged to solve puzzles about relationships with the characters.\"\n\n[...]",

I wouldn't be surprised if Fox resurfaces some time in the future but, at least for now, her days as a regular are over.\n\nSara, Gil Grissom's (Will Petersen) protege-turned-lover, exits in a particularly moody and quite good episode that resurrects a troubling old case (remember the manipulative and creepy child genius-murderer Hannah West from last season?

After escaping death at the nads of minature kill Natalie Kimble in the season eight opener \"Dead Doll,\" the gutsy CSI had struggled to settle back into her job, with even a marriage proposal from Grissom doing little to raise her spirits. Following an explosive row with Greg Sanders in the crime department's locker room, the final straw came for Sara when she was ordered to reopen a case that she and Nick had bungled a few years back, involving a suspected 12-year-old murderess (\"The Unusual Suspect\"). Weary of the strsses a job in Sin City can bring, Sara decides to bid farewell to Las Vegas for good, much to the dismay of her fellow CSIs.\n\nFor actress Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle since the second episode of the show's first season, it was important that her character left in this manner, as opposed to dying in the season seven finale, as was initially proposed. In an exclusive interview with \"The Official CSI Magazine\", the 39-year-old actress declared: \"I did not want Sara to die. I did not want that to be the way she went out. I have played characters that have died before so I am not afraid of that. It can actually make really good drama and it certainly happens in real life where people we know and love die. But I just didn't want that to be the end for Sara. In addition to that, I didn't want it to be under those circumstances. God forbit she was going to die, I didn't want it to be at the hands of some skinny, 5'5&#8243; little girl serial killer. There's no way. No way! Give me a gang of 25 people. Natalie is terrifying, psychotic and horrible, and I am sure it is part of the psychology of what happens when you play a charatcer that long, but I judt didn't want that to be the end of Sara.\"\n\nSo, will Grissom follow Sara into the Las Vegas sunset? Only time will tell ...  \n",

A lot of the equipment is given to us by the companies that make it, and there's a technical expert with us every day. I could probably use the equipment to fingerprint and identify body fluids, but most other things vanish from my brain as soon as I do them. I've never been told what Sara's specialism is. We only found out a lot of the background to each of our characters when a website was created with character profiles on it halfway through the first series. I found out then that Sara studied nuclear fusion.\"\n\nGrissom's office  \n\n\"The office beautifully reflects the character of William Petersen's CSI chief Gil Grissom. There are a few little in-jokes, like someone has the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's business card in a drawer, and there used to be a Billy Bass singing fish over the door, but that had to go because everyone kept setting it off. There's usually a crossword puzzle on the desk, so there are lots of scene where people come in and Grissom's doing a crossword. I try to block out the things in the jars on the shelves like the in vitro pig. When we started off there were some real crime scene photos on the walls, but I think those have been replaced by our own cases. One of the joys of this series is working closely with William again. Most of my scenes were with him for the first three series, but then Sara stopped chasing him, so I've missed working with him so much.\"\n\nThe autopsy room  \n\n\"When we started off the show we were liming in a disused morgue, but they decided we had to have a set when a real body got dropped off by mistake. Now we have something that's more state-of-the-art that most real autopsy rooms. I love doing scenes in there, but I do have days where I have to skip lunch because the special effects are so good and getting grosser. There was one story with some mangled legs and I thought I was going to pass out. Nothing is real, not even the skeleton. It's not the gore that gets to me, it's the idea of how these people died.\"\n\nWhat's in store for the new series?\n\n\"CSI\" has always had its share of shocking storylines, but perhaps none has taken viewers' breath away quite as much as the final scene of the last series in which CSI chief Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and his colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) were revealed to be having an affair.\n\nThe storyline incurred the wrath of the many fans who believed it would be fellow investigator Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) who would win Gil's heart yet, when the show returns this week, Grissom and Sara will still be together.\n\n\"It will be a secret to everyone but the audience,\" says \"CSI\"'s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn. \"But it's not just going to be the Grissom and Sara show from now on.

Last season's cliff-hanger saw Sara trapped under a car in the middle of the desert, no thanks to the diabolical Miniature Killer. If you watched last week's season premiere (and don't read any further if you haven't), the team finally found Sara dehydrated and barely alive. At the end of the episode, a clearly distraught Grissom holds her hand as she opens her eyes.\n\nToo bad Fox didn't want to stick around. The show actually beat \"Grey's Anatomy\" last week in total viewers. ",

        "content": "\nJorja has a raise on her mind. The star of \"CSI\" staged a one-day walkout from the set during the shoot of the CBS show's season finale, which airs May 17. The actress is in talks with producers about a new contract to keep her on the show, sources familiar with the discussions tell TV Guide. How those talks go may decide the result of the cliff-hanging finale in which Fox's character, Sara Sidle, is struck by an automobile. At one point the story had Sidle dying, but it was rewritten to be more ambiguous and Fox returned to work. Neither the network or a spokesperson for Fox would comment.\n\nFox had a salary dispute with the show in 2004, when she and costar George Eads demanded raises before they would show up for the start of production. They were both promptly fired and then reached an agreement to return to work. But Fox's character has become more prominent in the series over the last year. Sidle's relationship with Gil Grissom (William Petersen) has given the series its first serious romantic story line.",

It won't be the same without workaholic Sara, but after tonight's episode the criminologist who ranks No. 1 in the hearts of many viewers -- not to mention Gil Grissom -- parts ways with the crime lab when a case comes back to haunt her.\n\n[...]\n\nBYE-BYE, JORJA!\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS, 9/8c) TV loses its Fox-iest lady tonight as Sara hangs up her goggles and heads out of Grissom's life. What a \"Crime\", indeed.\n\n[...]\n\nSo Long, Sara!\n\nAs Jorja Fox leaves the lab this week, we recall the CSI's five greatest moments\n\nToo Tough To Die###  \n\n\"Season 1\" This heartbreaking story (a woman is sexually assaulted when shot, and will die if the bullets lodged in her brain are removed) spotlights two themes: Sara as an obsessed crusader for victimized women and how devoted Grissom (William Petersen) is to her. \"You're going to spend all your time in hospitals trying to help the people you couldn't save,\" he warns. She counters, \"I wish I was like you ... I wish I didn't feel anything.\"\n\nPlay With Fire  \n\n\"Season 3\" A bonanza for Fox-philes: After surviving a lab explosion, Sara returns to the job fearless, even reckless -- kicking open a suspect's door, gun drawn ... then asks Grissom out! in near-palpable pain, he declines, saying of their tortured relationship: \"I don't know what to do about this.\" Fun fact: Grissom's touching observation of her post-blast wound, \"\"Honey\", this doesn't look good,\" was ad-libbed by Petersen.\n\nNesting Dolls  \n\n\"Season 5\" During a spousal-murder investigation, an enraged Sara insults CSI Catherine (Marg Helgenberger), defies lab supervisor Ecklie (Marc Vann) and gets suspended. When Grissom visits her (at home!), she confesses that her abused mother killed her father, which landed her in foster care. Sara then breaks down and Grissom tenderly takes her hand. Awww ...\n\nWay to Go  \n\n\"Season 6\" This episode signed off with the long-yearned-for disclosure that our two star-crossed criminalists had finally hooked up. Sweet, and a little morbid, it occurs doing a bedroom discussion of death, with Grissom noting that he'd like to \"have enough time to say goodbye to the people I love.\" A grinning Sara purrs, \"I'm not ready to say goodbye.\"\n\nDead Doll  \n\n\"Season 8\" The sight of a traumatized, dehydrated Sara wandering the desert after her abduction by the Miniature Killer speaks volumes about her dogged survival instinct as well as her essential loneliness (a trait she and Grissom have in common). Then there's that heart-wrenching payoff, as exec producer Carol Mendelsohn recalls: \"I cry every time I see [that scene] when Grissom finally finds her.\n\n",

        "content": "On last week's episode of \"CSI\", in the crossover stunt featuring \"Without a Trace**s Jack Malone, Sara Sidle was shown as visibly shaken at an especially unsettling crime scene, walking away as if she'd had enough. Her psychological unease and emotional exhaustion had been well established even before last season's cliff-hanger that left her trapped under a car in the desert, as fans wondered all summer if TV's top procedural was going to kill off one of its own. Thankfully, \"CSI\" (as usual) took the high road, and this story reaches its destination tonight.\n\nUnless you've been in solitary the last few months, you know that tonight's heavily promoted (and for once, worth the hype) episode marks Sara Sidle's, and Jorja Fox's, departure from the series. Without going into the specifics (which would be wrong), let me just say this is a terrific farewell: melancholy, creepy and, most important, providing a dignified exit for an important character who will always be welcomed back into the fold -- and not just by her mentor-turned-lover Gil Grissom (William Petersen, who's also excellent in this moody episode).\n\nJorja Fox has always made it clear in her portrayal of Sara that this crime-scene tech is unusually susceptible to taking cases personally, to letting them get under her skin. That's certainly true in this episode, which resurrects a particularly troubling case from a previous season, involving a manipulative child genius (well and disturbingly played by Juliette Goglia) who knows just how to push Sara's buttons.\n\n\"You look different than you used to be: angry and a little said,\" scary little Hannah tells Sara in one of their encounters.\n\nSmart girl. Poor Sara. Nicely done, \"CSI.\"  \n",

        "content": "\nQuestion: Jorja Fox's last \"CSI\" episode just aired, and that got me to thinking about all the brouhaha back when the relationship between Grissom and Sara was revealed in the Season 6 finale. At the time, there were dire predictions that this was the end of the rope for the series. It had become a soap, turned a corner, jumped the shark, etc. Looking back at it now, do you think that the romance -- its reveal, and the way it was woven into Seasons 7 and 8 -- was a detriment to the show? An asset? My personal opinion is that the creators did a very nice job of keeping the relationship believable and not letting it overtake the procedural nature that is the show's hallmark. That said, Season 7 was perhaps one of \"CSI\"'s best, not because of the romance storyline but because of the writing (the \"miniature killer\" and Liev Schreiber arcs) and the artistic gambles the creators took: dead bodies that spoke, a \"monster movie\"-style episode, the incredibly cute \"clip show\" featuring the lab rats. -- Sandra S.\n\nMatt Roush: Couldn't agree more. \"CSI\" is more nimble than most at balancing the procedural storylines (the real draw on this and nearly every crime franchise) with the personal subplots, which rarely intrude or overtake the series. Not only is \"CSI\" among the best of its type at telling clever and creepy crime stories (last season was among its most sustained), but the unusual relationship between Grissom and Sara ranks high as well in terms of the subtlety and complexity of the writing and performances of both William Petersen and Jorja Fox. Rare for this sort of show, the relationship didn't cheapen the series but made the characters that much more intriguing. Allowing Sara to exit with dignity, while leaving the door open for the character to reappear eventually, was also a smart move.\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "Now that Jorja Fox has officially confirmed the/ worst kept secret in the TV biz -- she's ditching CSI next month after seven years in the forensics lab -- we can start to focus on more important things in life. Like, you know, her return to the show! In her only interview, CSI&#8216;s top gun, Carol Mendelsohn, weighs in on the circumstances surrounding Fox's exit, responds to published reports that she considered killing her off, previews tonight's big marriage proposal, and utters the words grieving fans have been dying to hear: Sara Sidle will be back. \n\nAre you bummed that something couldn't be worked out to keep Jorja around?\n\nCarol Mendelsohn: I am very bummed. You know, it's been something we've been facing for a while now [so] I've given it a lot of thought. When Jorja expressed her desire to move on -- even though I would have loved nothing more than to have had her here for Season 8 and Season 9 and on -- you [react] as you would in any family: You love the person and respect them and want them to be happy and fulfilled. If this was the very end for Sara Sidle on CSI, I don't think I could have handled the last few months. But it's not. Jorja was always No. 6 on our call sheet. We're retiring No. 6, so it's there for Jorja when she comes back.\n\nShe's definitely returning?\n\nMendelsohn: Yes. You can count on it.\n\n*This* season?\n\nMendelsohn: That I can't say. But the fans will not have seen the last of Sara Sidle. Nor will Grissom.\n\nWould you describe her departure as a mutual decision?\n\nMendelsohn: No. It was, in the end, Jorja's decision. And we accept it. I think sometimes the fans don't really understand that the writers are fans of the show, too. And we love Sara Sidle. We love writing for Sara Sidle. And, as an actor, it doesn't get better than Jorja. She's phenomenal. So, yeah, it's heartbreaking [for me], as well as for the cast and the crew. I'm almost tearing up now because it's very hard to say goodbye, even if it's [just] goodbye for now.\n\nDid you know she was leaving before you shot the season finale last April?\n\nMendelsohn: Yes. I didn't have a definitive date, but yes.\n\nThere were reports that the original plan was to kill her off in the finale, but Jorja refused to show up to work and shoot her death scene. Is that true?\n\nMendelsohn: Noâ¦ I don't, as a fan or a writer, embrace killing off characters -- especially when you see this outpouring that we have gotten from the fans in support of keeping Jorja and Sara on the show; it has just been mind-boggling. [We] owe the fans so much and I don't think killing off Sara Sidle would have ever been a way to pay a satisfactory ending for Sara.\n\nSo what kind of send-off *are* you giving her?\n\nMendelsohn: I'm not telling you. [Laughs]\n\nC'mon.\n\nMendelsohn: As the season unfolds through November, there is a character arc threaded through the episodes for Sara Sidle. And it is something that will build and build and build until the episode in which she departs, sometime in November.\n\nCan you shed any light on the final scene, like who's in it with her?\n\nMendelsohn: Jorja is in it with Jorja.\n\nShe's by herself?\n\nMendelsohn: Yes.\n\nWhat do you make of the intensity of the fan reaction to Jorja's exit?\n\nMendelsohn: It has been astounding. It's incredible how creative our fans are. We got two cases of chocolate covered insects with the message \"CSI without Sara bugs us.\" We got a bouquet of red, pink and white balloons with Hershey kisses and the message was, \"Don't break our hearts, keep Jorja Fox on CSI.\" We got two large cases of Lifesavers with the message, \"You were Sara's lifesaver, now be ours, keep Jorja Fox on CSI.\" They've been sending money in from all over the world [as part of the] Dollars for Sense campaign. One woman named Kim West from Northern Ireland, she and her friends sent in 60 pound notes, and she wrote a four page letter. It's just been overwhelming how many people love Jorja.\n\nDid you go back to her and beg her to reconsider?\n\nMendelsohn: I had done everything that I could. But in the end, I respect Jorja. This is something that she wanted to do, and I would never stand in her way. She's coming back at some point anyway. \n\nHow long before Grissom is ready to move on?\n\nMendelsohn: Oh my God. I don't think that Gil Grissom is the kind of guy that moves on quickly. I was thinking about how Gil Grissom thinks about time, and there's an Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, who said, \"The butterfly counts not months, but moments.\" I think Grissom thinks about time that way. I wouldn't count on Gil Grissom moving on.\n\nWhat about a little fling here and there?\n\nMendelsohn: Well, you know, gosh, I don't think of Grissom as a flingy kind of guy. Of course, there is Lady Heather... Grissom's family is the team, and moving forward, you know, that's what Grissom will focus on. His team. His family.\n\nSpeaking of Lady Heather, will she be back this season?\n\nMendelsohn: You know what? We haven't really talked about it. [But the door is] always open. We love Melinda Clarke.\n\nWhat can you tell me about tonight's episode -- specifically the marriage proposal?\n\nMendelsohn: It's very CSI-style. David Rambo wrote the scene and he and Jackie Hoyt wrote the episode. We have been talking for months about how to do this. And, originally at the beginning of the season, we had a plan to take Grissom and Sara back to San Francisco, because, as we all know, that's where they first met. And then last week, Grissom found this beehive and it just occurred to us what the scene should be, and I love it. I love it. And again, there are many, many more scenes between them in the last few episodes and they're all terrific.\n\n\"For more from Mendelsohn -- including scoop on which \"CSI\" couple will fill the Sara/Grissom void and her hopes (and fears) regarding the looming contract talks with the \"rest\" of the cast -- come back tomorrow for Part Two of my interview.

Although a rep for the actress declined to comment, a source close to the show confirms that her contract expires next month and she's itching to pursue greener (and less grisly) pastures. \"Her leaving makes perfect sense,\" says my spy. \"She's been there for seven years, she's made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing.\" And resolve it in what could be a \"very\" permanent way. Consider the evidence supporting a case of premeditated murder: In \"CSI's\" May 17th season finale, Grissom and Sara's relationship will be \"suddenly forced out into the open,\" according to CBS. In that same episode, the miniature serial killer returns and Sara goes missing. C'mon, folks &#8212; you don't need a magnifying glass or lab techs to solve this mystery.",

        "content": "\nQuestion: Just wanted to thank you for your recent comments about \"CSI\" and Jorja Fox. Your response to Sandra S.' question about whether Grissom and Sara's relationship hurt \"CSI\" was the most accurate evaluation of their romance and the last couple of seasons of the show that I've read. It was nice to see someone in the media not jumping on the \"they turned the show into a soap opera!\" bandwagon, which so many fans inexplicably have joined. Personally, I wonder if the \"soap opera\" people are watching the same show I've been watching.-- Melanie\n\nMatt Roush: There is no trickier tightrope to walk in series TV than for those procedurals that balance casework with personal stories. Some of these shows do turn into soap operas, but I feel classic \"CSI\" managed to add these elements more successfully than most, without significantly altering or ruining the show. Which doesn't stop people from obsessing.\n\nTake this over-the-top reaction from Barb C.: \"I would suggest you visit the \"CSI\" message boards and chat rooms to get viewers' reaction; people are very disappointed with how Sara's departure was written. Fans are angry and feel it was such a letdown. There was an indication a possible marriage could occur because of the proposal, but it did not. What were the writers thinking! It was not believable that she simply would kiss him, then go to her locker, remove her name badge and call a cab before Grissom goes looking for her. Now fans are losing interest and are planning to boycott the show. The whole storyline of Grissom and Sara was so popular and fans are not happy about this. Maybe the writers' strike will give them time to get their creative juices flowing again. I plan on watching the reruns and will return when I know that Grissom and Sara are together again.\"\n\nThanks for the invitation, but it's precisely because of overheated reactions like this that I tend to avoid message boards and chat rooms. An informed fan of the show would know that this departure was Jorja Fox's decision, not the producers'. And while it may have been a mistake to dangle the proposal storyline as a possibility when it was already known she was leaving the show, the fact that the writers attempted to explain her departure in psychological rather than melodramatic or romance-novel terms impressed me. What, you'd rather they'd killed her in the cliffhanger? You should see the crazy mail I keep getting from those who can't get over Prison Break killing off the Sara Tancredi character. Face it: She's gone. I agree that the way they offed her was disgusting and insulting, and in this case, it may well be the sort of thing that could turn some people off the show forever. (I had already made my own escape, thank you.) But the idea that \"CSI\" fans en masse will boycott the show because of Sara's departure? Not likely.  \n",

Sara's life hung in the balance because of the car &#8212; \"and\" the fact that Fox's contract with the CBS hit was up for renewal. So will she be sticking around?\n\nExecutive producer Naren Shankar's not telling. \"Let's just say fans will be very satisfied with how it turns out,\" he says. \"No loose ends will be left dangling at the end of the first episode.\"\n\nRumors have run rampant all summer about Sara's fate, and TV Guide reported that the show will add a new female character come Episode 3 who \"may be a CSI or a lab tech,\" according to exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. She, too, won't say if Sara lives.\n\nShankar, though, is happy to talk about filming the scene in the September 27 season opener in which viewers will discover the truth. In the finale, the killer had left a miniature version of the crime scene for Grissom. For the first episode of Season 8, set designers built a full-scale replica on the show's Hollywood soundstage, including everything from a car mounted on hydraulics to 28,000 gallons of water.\n\nThere were moments when Shankar says he wasn't sure Fox would make it through the filming. For a good portion of it, she was stuck under the car, surrounded by recirculated water, and Shankar says he got \"a little nervous. Jorja was a total trouper and everything was designed for 100 percent safety, but when you're watching, you get a little knot in your stomach.\"\n\nIt may be nerve-racking, but even the \"CSI\" cast members who aren't in those scenes showed up to watch. \"The actors were as impressed as anybody by what we built,\" Shankar says. \"They came back from their time off and went, &#8216;Holy crap!' Everybody was pretty knocked out by this.\" It sounds like we will be, too.",

        "content": "\n\nQuestion: This question has been eating away at me for months and I'm hoping you can help me out. I've always enjoyed spoilers. I'm the impatient type, and summer is usually the worst stretch of time for me. TVGuide.com is obviously known for giving out little tidbits here and there about certain shows, but why aren't we \"allowed\" to know specific details? I'll use \"CSI\" as an example, or more to the point, Jorja Fox. She will either be back or she won't, and we already know that at least one reporter knows the truth, so why can't we be in on the secret? I guess my question is: Where's the line? What's the difference between a spoiler and knowing who will be back for what episodes? Does this depend on what the reporter is willing to divulge? And what would happen if they did, against the producers' or writers' wishes? Some part of me admires the fact that reporters are willing to keep a secret, but the much more selfish side doesn't quite understand why they would when it is their job to keep us informed! -- Sharon\n\nMatt Roush: You're really barking up the wrong tree here. I don't necessarily mind spoilers, in moderation, but there are certain things that really ought not to be leaked, and a major plot angle like the fate of Sara after the cliff-hanger may be one of them. (The twist at the end of \"Lost\" last season is another, and I'm glad that, despite the odds, I was able to stay in the dark until I watched the actual episode.) Given that the character's future is tied up with what no doubt are complex contract negotiations, it's pretty amazing if it hasn't been leaked already. I honestly think we are sometimes too much in the loop when it comes to the machinations of many TV shows. If you know an actor is only going to do X number of episodes, that already takes some of the fun out of wondering where his or her character's particular story arc might be headed. But in the case of Sara, Jorja Fox and \"CSI\", the producers seem to want to keep all of this as under wraps as possible, and while I'm aware there are reporters in my own midst who know more than I do, I'm glad they're not telling me or anyone else just yet. We're not talking government secrets here, we're talking about a popular TV show that may want to save some of its surprises for the time an episode actually airs. If we're doing our jobs right, we'll be prepared to report that story to its fullest when the time comes. And if that means playing ball with the producers at times and agreeing not to leak something we may already have confirmed, why is that a crime? It's not our job to ruin the TV-watching experience for everyone. Going back many years, if anyone had blown for me the fact that Henry Blake wouldn't make it back home on \"M\\A\\S*H\", or that Rosalind Shays would fall down the elevator shaft on \"L.A. Law\" or that Andy Sipowicz's son would be killed in an off-duty incident on \"NYPD Blue\", I don't think I would have ever forgiven them. ",

Multiple sources confirm that Jorja Fox -- whose contract expired at the end of last season -- will depart the hit procedural this November after failing to come to terms on a new long-term deal. And although Fox doesn't outright confirm her exit, in the following exclusive interview the actress did open up about the difficulty of keeping Sara's fate a secret all these months, her residual \"hurt\" feelings following her firing in 2004, whether the conclusion of the Sara-Grissom love story will be satisfying to viewers, and why she will never address those persistent tabloid rumors. \n\nCongratulations on surviving the Miniature Killer.  \nJorja Fox: Thank you! It wasn't easy! [Laughs]\n\nWas it as physically grueling to shoot those scenes as it appeared?  \nFox: It was so much more fun than I thought it was going to be. Traditionally, I'm the wimp of the cast. I'm the one who's more sensitive to the blood and stuff. I was so happy to get through it without even a scratch. Of course, everyone took such amazing care of me. I really do believe that we have the best stuntpeople and the best special-effects people in the business. I knew I was in very good hands, but I was nervous, for sure.\n\n*I imagine it had to have been pretty hot, shooting in the desert. *  \nFox: I think it was more grueling on the crew. I had a couple of days where I got to the desert at around 4 or 5 in the afternoon. By the time I got there, it had cooled off to around 104. [Laughs] We sent one person to the hospital the first day with heat exhaustion, but he was fully recovered by the next day. I was lucky because I was wet for a lot of the episode, and that really took the edge off.\n\nWas it always the plan for Sara to survive? Reports surfaced last spring that Sara was actually supposed to die in the finale, but you had refused to show up to shoot your death scene.  \nFox: Well, you know, Mike, you can't believe anything you read in those gossip magazines. And for all of us who were invested in the integrity of the story, we didn't want to say yes or no to any of those reports, because we didn't want to [ruin the outcome for viewers]. But none of that stuff is ever true. I was really flattered that people were that interested in me, though. [Laughs] The biggest challenge was keeping my mouth shut. Whenever you start reading stuff like that -- especially if it's not super-flattering -- the first thing you want to do is defend yourself. So it was challenging to sit quiet and wait. I'm so thrilled that the wait is over. I had to lie to my relatives, I had to lie to my friendsâ¦. It's hard.\n\nWell, since you don't have to keep the secret any longer, can you state for the record that there was no truth to reports that you skipped work because you didn't want to shoot a particular scene?  \nFox: The reason I'm going to barely answer this question is because I made it a point in my life not to address anything that's written in those magazines. And I feel like if I start now, there's a whole litany of stuff over the last seven years that's been written about me, and I don't want those guys to think I'm ever going to answer to them, because I'm not going to. It pertains to CSI, it pertains to my personal lifeâ¦ And I decided a long time ago that I was going to stay out of it. I was going to let the fiction that they print read like fiction. I know people enjoy those magazines, but I'm not going to engage. So in that way, I'm going to almost not answer your question. But what I can say is it was true that my contract was up, and so CBS and I had been in active conversations since about January of '07. \n\nWe're hearing that you are leaving the show after only a handful of episodes. What happened?  \nFox: Againâ¦ I can't answer those questions right now. I would love, at some point in the future, to talk with you again. Because I am under contract with the show at this point, I'm not actually allowed to talk about storylines that haven't aired yet. So since I've already been sitting in a pile of secrecy since last April, I'm going to have to keep the secret a little longer. I apologize. [Laughs]\n\nOK, well, let's discuss the fact that your contract is up. What's been going through your mind?  \nFox: It's interesting, I've never had a job in my life where my contract ended. In TV you're so lucky if you can be on a show for two years. It was a really sort of profound and strange feeling to be coming -- at least contractually -- to the end of a run. My contract was the first to come up. The contracts for all the other regulars on the show will be up at the end of this year. \n\nWhy did yours come up sooner?  \nFox: As is tradition in the business, every couple of years, people put in for a raise. And a couple of years ago everybody put in for a raise, and I decided not to take the raise that was offered me. And If I had taken that raise, it would've added a year to my contract. I'm the only one who didn't take the raise.\n\nDid you want to keep your options open?  \nFox: Not at all, actually. Doing this show has been one of the most rewarding things in my life. It's almost intangible to be able to describe how much I love and respect everybody over there. At the time, there was a lot of drama at our show. A lot of people had been put through the ringer, and to be perfectly frank with you, I was uncertain at that point [about staying]. There were some hard feelings that went around, and I didn't want to enlist for any extra time at that point. I was feeling a little hurt and angry by some of the events that happened a couple of years ago that relate to the firing of myself and the firing of George Eads. And so, at that point, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give anybody any extra time. And the raise was terrible, to be frank. An extra year for that amount of money? No thank you. Thank you very much, it's very flattering, but no thank you.\n\nWere you ever bored by the constraints of acting in a procedural?  \nFox: I never was. I've been one of the luckiest people in the history of TV getting to play the character of Sara. Almost since Episode 10 in Season 1, I've had a lot to do. My character has had a very full personal life. I've gotten to have several boyfriends. I've had a couple meltdowns. I was almost killed a couple of times. They almost blew me up once. I feel like the writers have been extremely generous in terms of giving me a lot to do, especially all the interesting relationship stuff between Sara and Grissom. I've always had mountains of subtext to do, all under the umbrella of this procedural, which actually made it more fun. I always thought of CSI as an action-adventure show. I know that a lot of folks call it a procedural. But I feel like our goal every week is to have the audience sitting up on their couch instead of lying back. It's very edge-of-your-seat, and there's a lot of suspense. So, for that, it's been amazing for me. Almost more than anyone, I've been blessed with subtext.\n\nIt was a nice moment when Sara and Grissom connected at the end of the episode. What's next for them?  \nFox: The cat is out of the bag now. They've been having this secret affair -- for an undetermined amount of time, which we will get into a little more in Episode 2. Like, just how long have these two been seeing each other? There's going to be a wealth of information that we're going to find out about Sara and Grissom in Season 8. We shot five episodes so far, and I think it's going to be a really exciting, interesting season. The writers have done a phenomenal job. There have been so many twists and turns already, and little bombs that we've dropped, I'm already blown away. I'm like, \"Where's this going? We're only in Episode 5.\"\n\nExec producer Jonathan Littman confirmed over the summer that the Sara-Grissom story would conclude this season. Your thoughts?  \nFox: I can't contradict what one of our producers said, but I can only tell you from my experience, I don't think you're going to get that. This might sound vain, but the story of Sara and Grissom is a little like a fable. And most great fables don't really have 100 percent resolution. \n\nDo you think fans will be satisfied with how the story is wrapped up?  \nFox: I pray that they're satisfied. It's a really tricky, difficult thing to do. When I was hired back in 2000, I was the last cast member added. They decided they wanted to add a character after the pilot got picked up. And in my little explanation of my character, it said clearly, \"A love interest for the character of Grissom.\" And then, pretty quickly, the writers changed their minds about that; they weren't sure if that was the direction that they wanted to go in. There were so many stories to tell at that time. But, in the meantime, Billy and I as actors -- because that's what we had been hired to do -- sort of played this beat that we had been told about. So, it's a very tricky thing to have characters on TV start having an affair. I hope that people have enjoyed it. It's been a complete joy for me to play. And the funny thing about our show is, from the very beginning, about 50 percent of our audience wanted more personal-life stories, and 50 percent of our audience just wanted us to stick to the procedurals. The writers know that, no matter what story they're telling, they're letting down somebody. And that's a hard thing to do. So I think they made a decision that they really just had to write from their hearts and hope that people would come along for the story. I think that's what Billy and I have done, too. I don't know if [viewers will] be satisfied. And I stay away from the blogs. I use to check them a little bit when the show first started, but I realized that I was getting really attached to people's approval. And I'd get really freaked out if they didn't like something. So I decided that the only way I could sort of stay true to this character was to just be her and not focus too much on what people were thinking. \n\nHow's your relationship with William Petersen?  \nFox: I sit every once in a while and I think about plays and films I can do with William Petersen into our eighties. He's the most incredible scene partner I've ever had. And again, I've never had the opportunity to work with somebody for seven years like that. It's a really unique experience as an actor to have a scene partner for that long. And then at the end of the seven years to think more highly of them than you did in the first year, to find them even more complex and interesting. He's a great friend and I feel like I couldn't have scored any higher than getting William Petersen to be my boyfriend on TV. It's been amazing.\n\nWhat else do you have on your plate professionally?  \nFox: I have a couple of things in the works. I've had this theater company for a long time and I'm working on a new play. I don't want to talk too much about that right now. But in a couple of months I'd love to talk more about it.\n\nI'm guessing Fox may be ready to talk about it on Nov. 9, which is the day after her final CSI is slated to air. The title of her swan song is, appropriately enough, \"Hello, Goodbye.\" [...]",

My response: Tune in to the season opener. We know where we're going with it. It's where we've talked about going from the beginning of this season. We'd ended last year with the reveal of Sara and Grissom's relationship and had been doing that dance of who in the lab is going to know. But, then you ask, how many coy ways can you not reveal it? We felt we had to reveal it [in the finale], so what better way to do it than in the moment of real crisis for Grissom (William Peterson)? We also wanted to leave her alone in the desert in that terrible position because we were going for something different. Most of the other victims of the killer were found in residential spaces, so we wanted a location that would make it difficult for our team to find. We ended up in the wide-open desert. And there's a strong likelihood we'll be seeing the killer again next season.\n\n[...]",

Last year's finale had the CSI team not only continue their search for the \"Miniature Killer\" but also for Sara, who became the killer's last victim. There was a lot of speculation over the summer surrounding Sara's fate especially since the show was doing its best to keep it a secret (fans were told they would at least see Sara under the car in the premiere but didn't say more).\n\nBack in April, we learn that \"CSI\" was planning to kill off a main character and in the following weeks, Sara's name started to pop. Jorja Fox was not a happy camper, even refusing to show up for work at one point. This summer, the show hired an actress to play a new lab tech, which had fans think that it was done for Sara and that the new character was her replacement.\n\n[...]\n\nLast night, it was revealed that Sara Sidle lived. The character put up a fight and beat the odds. It was a fantastic episode filled with twists and turns. I've taken the time to read a few reviews before I wrote this post and it seems most \"CSI\" fans were on the edge of their seats throughout the episode, thought the acting was stellar, and are happy that Sara survived.\n\nSara may have survived but \"TV Guide's\" Michael Ausiello reveals that the actress did not come to terms with the show contract-wise and will be departing \"CSI\" later this fall. Minutes after the premiere aired, Ausiello posted an interesting interview with Jorja Fox in which the actress doesn't want to confirm if she will be departing or not (there is a clause in her contract preventing her from giving spoilers). The interview is worth the read, especially if you are a \"CSI\" fan. \n\n[...]\n",

        "content": "\nDoes being too popular do more harm than good? CSI star Jorja Fox says her blessing in disguise was Not Always Fitting In.\n\n'Where I grew up, I wasn't even close to being cool. My family lived in the smallest, most rural town in Florida, called Melbourne Beach, and it was an outdoors-y community where beauty was all about being tanned and blonde. \n\nBut I was chubby, awkward and fair-skinned with dark hair - and a 10p-sized gap between my teeth.\n\nAnd it wasn't just my body that didn't fit in. Both my parents were from immigrant families in Montreal, Canada, before they emigrated to the US. My mum was French Canadian and my dad is Irish. After I was born in New York, we moved to Florida when I was three and joined a long-established Southern community.\n\nCertain things about my family seemed quite eccentric. My grandmother used to cook chicken in a rotisserie on the front porch and people would walk by and stare, saying, **What\" is that machine? What is she doing? And \"why\" is it on the porch?' We were definitely weird.\n\nMy mum was a big champion for me when I was growing up. She was very classic and reserved and manners mattered most to her. So we didn't speak much about physical beauty -- it wasn't so important. She was very, very poor and homeless during the Depression -- she was 40 years older than me -- so having chubby kids was the greatest thing in the world to her. That's why she had three fridges!\n\nI still got along OK though. I wasn't the most popular kid at school but that can be a good thing. I was able to float in and out of lots of social circles. I had an amazing childhood.\n\nMy life changed when, ironically, I won a modelling contest at the local shopping plaza. I was the most surprised at my win. I was laughed at when my picture appeared in the paper. At school the next day the other kids were asking, 'what kind of contest \"was\" that, surely there's a mistake?'\n\nBut winning opened up a universe of possibilities for me. I ended up catwalk modelling in New York as a teenager before becoming an actress in my 20s. \n\nBut I feel like I'm still making the transition and can't help but think, 'I'll probably get fired today.' My life is so charmed I can't quite believe it.\n\nI didn't even think it was going to last when I first landed the role of Sara Sidle on CSI. I thought it would be a short-term job. When it started six years ago, there weren't any other crime shows like it, and we didn't think anyone would want to watch a drama about death on a Friday night. But now it's a worldwide phenomenon and unravelling murders has proved magnetic.\n\nI'm not surprised \"CSI\"'s audience in the UK is 75 per cent female. Women naturally have an investigative streak and are good at piecing things together. Also, there's something about \"CSI\" that tells you, without any doubt, the truth. Ninety per cent of the time we solve the case by the end of the show and I think that's something people find very satisfying.'",

The flagship show's characters are more cerebral, its sets dressed in somber blues. It may have made for better storytelling to have Sara Sidle die at the hands of the Miniature Killer, but her actual departure fit better with the show's sensibilities.\n\n[Sara didn't have the sawdust to handle spoilers.]\n\nWe open with Sara alone in the dark, cutting at something. The background lights to reveal the LVPD locker room, and then we're at a stereotypical college dorm. Not stereotypical is the girl falling to her death.\n\nWant to see your favorite investigators this week? Too bad. They get less time than when Jack Malone stormed through last week. Instead, we're all about Sara. To that end, the falling girl is connected to Marlon West, the killer from a few years ago whose super-genius little sister threw enough doubt into a jury to ruin Sara's murder case. Now in college, Marlon was dating Kira (this week's corpse) until a very public breakup that ended in a fistfight with Kira's new boy.\n\nSupergenius sister Hannah is teaching and doing graduate studies at the same college, and no points for guessing she stymies Sara's investigation again. Unfortunately for Marlon, a chip of his tooth is found in Kira's hand, and Sara figures out (thanks to photos that may as well have giant flashing \"Clue\" signs) that Hannah took the chip from the fistfight, drugged Kira's adult-use lubricant, planted the chip in the girl's hand and then pushed her out the window. Why? Because Marlon was drifting away &#8212; also known as developing a normal life &#8212; and Hannah couldn't stand not having him close by at all times.\n\nI don't think she thought her cunning plan all the way through. While jail may indeed keep Marlon close, it also proves to be a convenient spot for suicide. Sara gets to destroy Hannah with the news.\n\nOh, there was a micro-subplot about an abused woman that served only to contrast Ronnie's optimism with Sara's cynicism. Feel free to ignore it.\n\nGil_240 Anyway, at the end Sara pens a very sweet letter for Grissom and then leaves with no set destination. Poor Gil is devastated &#8212; William Petersen's one expression conveys more emotion than Sara has all season.\n\nReally, we see Sara isn't so different from Hannah. Both are brilliant but socially inept and so tend toward overly dramatic but ill-conceived gestures. That was my interpretation, anyway, and for me the heartfelt feelings in the letter were absolutely invalidated by the fact that Sara would rather just run away with no plan.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox's character on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" is known for fighting crime. Now the actress is taking a stand against wrong-doers in real life, too.\n\nFox, well known for her prominent role as Sara Sidle on the CBS hit, is campaigning against the suffering of circus animals. She will hand deliver copies of a new scientific report on the circus animal abuse to officials at Austin's City Hall on Friday.\n\nThe report is from Animal Defenders International (ADI), a non-profit organization that is currently promoting their \"Stop Circus Suffering\" campaign.\n\n\"We sent Jorja an advance copy of our DVD and report and told her what was happening to the animals. She was really concerned. It really moved her, and she said she wanted to do whatever she could to help,\" ADI President Jan Creamer tells the Celebrity News Service exclusively.\n\nThe DVD contains \"new, shocking undercover footage of tiger cubs, elephants and other circus animals being punched in the face, beaten and kicked in the name of &#8216;entertainment,'\" according to a press release.\n\nADI is hoping to capture attention by screening the footage at the City Hall press conference. It will also be sent to the U.S. Congress for review. Fox's involvement will promote the the campaign's call for a nation-wide ban of animal circuses.\n\n\"She's a very compassionate person. What we really appreciate about her is that she is using her celebrity for good causes,\" Creamer tells CNS.\n\nFox has been active in other causes, as well. She is vegetarian and supports the Human Rights Campaign. She has also worked with PETA.\n\n\"People respect people like Jorja for what they've achieved in their career. People get a slight idea of the real Jorja when they look at some of the issues she's covered in her career, on shows like &#8216;CSI' and &#8216;The West Wing,'\" says Creamer.\n\n\"We saw an episode of CSI where Jorja investigated the murder of a gorilla... Species like gorillas, they're our cousins,\" says Creamer, adding, \"She really highlighted that in the episode. It was moving.\"\n\nJorja is not the only celebrity involved with ADI's efforts. Creamer tells CNS that many high-profile celebrities have campaigned with the organization, including Alicia Silverstone, and Paul McCartney and his daughter.\n\nFox has definitely been keeping busy since she left \"CSI\" last year. Fans who miss her character on the show will have an opportunity to see Sara Sidle back in action again when she returns as a guest star in the show's season premiere in September.  \n",

Fox became part of the project through Kirsten Holly Smith, who essays the role of Springfield in the musical.\n\n\"I've always been a big fan of Dusty Springfield,\" Fox told the Lesbian News. \"Even many years ago I read her story and found it interesting. I wanted to turn it into a screenplay. Kirsten, who I've known for years, called me and told me she was doing this show about Dusty Springfield. I was like, &#8216;Wow, ain't that a small world.'

In fact, the time has come for fans to welcome one of the key players of the forensic drama, Jorja Fox, whose character left the series in the season 7 episode \"Goodbye and Good Luck\" where she had to go face the ghost of her past.\n\nAccording to \"TV Guide\", the 39-year-old actress has just inked a deal to return for \"CSI**s ninth season premiere next fall. Not much has been revealed about her anticipated comeback as plot details are being kept under wraps for now. However, it has been reported that she \"won't be appearing in a flashback.\"\n\nIn line with this, speculations have surged that Fox's return to the forensic drama has something to do with the mourning of Warrick (Gary Dourdan), who was shot and presumably killed in the season 8 finale. On the other hand, these are all just presumptions given that \"CSI\" boss Carol Mendelsohn hinted in the latest issue of \"TV Guide\" that Dourdan will be back in the fall and \"not just in flashbacks.\"\n\nFox, who is also credited for her work on \"ER\" and \"The West Wing\", joined CSI in 2000 and was known as materials and element analyst and eventually the love interest of Gil Grissom (William Petersen). In 2004, she got caught up in a controversy when she was reportedly fired from the forensic drama for allegedly failing to submit a letter to CBS for confirming that she would be on time for shooting. The dispute was resolved in just over a week and Fox was rehired by the network. Early last year, the news about her possible departure on the show emerged and despite fans' efforts to keep her on the program, Fox decided that season 8 will be her last.  \n",

Her departure came after years of drama over her status with the show. She and fellow costar George Eads were fired -- temporarily -- back in '04, when their contract renegotiations went sour. The show shut down production for 10 days, with Fox reportedly having refused to sign a letter stating that she would get to work on time.

        "content": "\nAllen MacDonald has been with \"CSI\" since the show's third season. He's climbed the ranks from writers' assistant to staff writer and has had a hand in some of the most significant episodes of the last few seasons, including \"Dead Doll\" and Goodbye and Good Luck\", which saw the exit of the first regular character to leave the show, Sara Sidle. Though busy at work for an episode for the show's eighth season following the hundred day WGA strike, MacDonald took the time to discuss the current season and his career at \"CSI\" with CSI Files.\n\n[...]\n\nCSI Files: How many more scripts will you be doing personally after this one?\n\nMacDonald: I think this is it for me. Anything can change, but I did \"Dead Doll\" with Dustin and Naren and I worked on Goodbye and Good Luck\" , which was Jorja Fox's last episode. Those were two pretty cool assignments to get to be involved in! I had a pretty good season, so I think that after this point I'll be done until next year.\n\nCSI Files: You've been involved in writing a lot of the episodes with Sara, like \"The Unusual Suspects\" and \"Empty Eyes\" where Sara's disillusionment with her job really started and began to take its toll. How much advance planning went into that arc? How much warning did you that Jorja Fox was planning to leave the show?\n\nMacDonald: First of all, I loved writing for Jorja Fox. I love all the characters on \"CSI\", but I think all the writers gravitate towards a particular character and for me that's always been Nick Stokes (George Eads) and Sara Sidle. Their worldview fits mine.\n\nCSI Files: They're really opposites in a lot of ways-Nick is the determined optimist while Sara is the jaded pessimist. What is it about those two different characters that appeals to you?\n\nMacDonald: I don't know if I have an answer. This is my interpretation of Nick: when you're working a job like crime scene investigating and forensics, you're encountering a lot darkness and a lot of death, seeing the darker side of humanity. I think most of the time Nick very successfully compartmentalizes everything. He can keep the darkness in a box without the job bleeding into his life. I think Sara has a very hard time compartmentalizing and keeping things in that box and it definitely bleeds into her daily life. That's what always fascinated me about Sara Sidle was that she was so strong, but she feels so much that it's a constant struggle for her.\n\nCSI Files: They really do seem like two sides of a coin.\n\nMacDonald: I love them working together because to me, they're like brother and sister. The idea of them having any romantic relationship-which has never been brought up-I would find distasteful. They really care about each other. The scene that comes through the most for me is a scene in \"Empty Eyes\" when they're processing the house where the showgirls live and Sara comes into the kitchen where Nick is already processing and he asks her if she's okay and she says, \"Yeah. Let's work.\" Just the look between them, there was so much empathy and connection between them. Those two characters were really there for each other. I'm talking a lot about those two, but I do love all the other characters. There was a line in that scene where Nick asks if Sara's okay, and she says, \"Yeah, I'm just not used to them being alive.\"\n\nYou brought up Sara Sidle's [exit]-I was very fortunate that I got to work on a lot of her final episodes, the kind of mini-arc leading up to her departure. You asked me before how long before we knew she was leaving-we only knew before we started those last seven episodes. When we did \"The Unusual Suspects\" we didn't know [Jorja was leaving]. When we did that, I was pretty sure I wanted to do a sequel, but I didn't know it was going to be Sara Sidle's last episode. That was Naren's idea.\n\nCSI Files: So he was the one who came up with the idea to bring Hannah West back as an impetus for Sara leaving?\n\nMacDonald: I always wanted to bring that character back. I had pitched two big stories [at the beginning of season eight]. They chose one of them, which was a very dark episode, to be Sara's last episode, and as we got closer to that episode, it's was Naren's very clever brainstorm to [switch them]. I pitched the dark one and \"The Unusual Suspects\" sequel and basically the dark one was going to be Jorja's last episode and then Naren flipped them.\n\nCSI Files: So is that dark one on hold until season nine?\n\nMacDonald: Yes. Just the idea of that Hannah West/Marlon West were, in Sara's view at least, a failure in her life that she would like to remedy, and [a repeat of that] failure that would really get under her skin enough to make her rethink what she wants to do with her future.\n\nCSI Files: And Hannah is a maddening character-she's the prodigy that can't be caught.\n\nMacDonald: I love that character. Those two episodes are by far my favorite episodes, \"The Unusual Suspects\" and \"Goodbye and Good Luck.\"\n\nCSI Files: How did you end up working on that last episode for Sara?\n\nMacDonald: Because I had pitched those two ideas and they chose the darker one to be Sara's last episode, I was assigned to that. And then because Naren liked \"The Unusual Suspect\" episode and since I had written the original episode, I [kept the assignment after the switch]. But it's important to know that for all of the scripts, it is absolutely a team effort and a lot of different people are involved at different stages of the game. Sarah Goldfinger and Naren were both huge parts of both those scripts.\n\n[...]\n\nCSI Files: Where did your inspiration for \"Empty Eyes\" come from?\n\nMacDonald: That was based very heavily on a killer named Richard Speck, who in the late 60s had broken into a house at a nursing school and he had killed eight girls one after another. One of them had managed to crawl under the bed. In reality, he didn't know she was there. He was so caught up in the killing, he never even counted and lost track, so he assumed he'd killed them all and left the house. She's still alive. Carol always wanted to do the Richard Speck story-it was in Chicago and Carol's from Chicago. I had pitched to her earlier in the year, the idea that I wanted Sara to find a victim still alive-a victim that was dying, who was going to die and there was very little that could be done, but that she would try to speak to Sara, and that Sara would be in a position where she would have to be empathetic, comforting her in her final moments, but also to get that valuable information about what happened to her that she would have as a first-person witness. It's that conflict between being a human being and doing your job and how that would haunt Sara. Watching someone die gives it a whole new dimension.\n\n[...]\n\nCSI Files: How was the decision made to end that season on a cliffhanger? Was there ever any talk of killing Sara off in \"Dead Doll\"?\n\nMacDonald: There was never any serious talk of killing her off. We knew at the beginning of the season that she was going to be in peril at the end of the season. While we never intended to kill her, we needed [the audience] to think we were going to kill her. If they don't think there's much of a possibility that she's going to die, then the episode isn't much fun to watch! The rumors only helped!\n\n[...]\n\nCSI Files: Sara and Grissom's romance was a big part of the seventh season and the first part of this current one. \"CSI\" originally stayed away from romance, but now all three shows seem to be embracing it. Do you think it was wise for the show to go down that path?\n\nMacDonald: Well, you can only play the &#8216;will they or won't they' for so long. They either do or they don't. Another huge television staple is unrequited love-characters that love each other, they're soul mates, but they can't be together. And the fun part is their not being together. \"Moonlighting\" is the classic example of a show that was basically creatively dead when the couple got together. We brought Sara and Grissom together in a credible way, but I don't think we short-changed the characters by doing it. You've got to have a bump in the road! It was fun to see them in a relationship during season seven, and what made it fun was that nobody else knew about it. That changed in the finale \"Living Doll\". It's such a great moment when Sara was kidnapped that it came out that they were together. I think you can make it work having them together. I think \"The Office\" does a phenomenal job of having Jim and Pam together. On a TV show, there's always going to be some conflict around the corner. I'm sure eventually a wrench will be thrown into Jim and Pam's happiness.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nIn her eight years working the Las Vegas graveyard shift, Sara Sidle faced more than her fair share of heartache, which eventually resulted in her leaving Sin City for good. Actress Jorja Fox recalls her time on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and reveals why it was the right moment for her to leave the show.\n\n&#8212;-\n\nWhen it comes to Sara Sidle, it's definitely a case of gone but not forgotten for the show's millions of fans. And that goes for Jorja Fox too. Several months after bidding \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" farewell for good, the 39-year-old actress explains what attreacted her to the character in the first place, and reveals what she misses most about working on the series. She also talks about \"that\" bedroom scene...\n\n\"The Official CSI Magazine:\" Looking back, what do you recall about landing the plum part of Sara Sidle?\n\nJorja Fox: I remember it fairly well actually. I had been working on \"The West Wing\" at the time. I kept getting calls from friends asking, \"Hey, have you heard of this show? They are adding this character at the last minute. You should check it out.\" I was really happy on \"The West Wing.\" I didn't pursue it at all. I was like, \"No thank you, but thanks for thinking of me.\" Then finally, a script came from my agency and it was the show my friends had been calling me about/ Probably five pages in, I fell into a trance, knew I had to go meet everybody, and that if I was lucky enough that they were going to case me, I was going to have to take the job. It was this magnetic pull and I couldn't stop it anymore. There was a little byline for the character, Sara Sidle, and it said she was from San Francisco, was coming in to help on an internal case in Las Vegas, that she was going to be a love interest for Grissom, was really tough, had poor social skills, and could drink anyone under the table. It has been pretty consistently like that for seven years so they were right on. I went in, met everybody for the first time &#8212; I had been run over accidentally on \"The West Wing\" a month or two before so I was limping around. I thought there was no way they were going to hire this actress with these crutches. They brought me back and who knew? I ended up getting it so I was thrilled.\n\nIn the beginning, Sara ruffled a few feathers, especially Catherine's. Were you concerned there would be this continuing tension?\n\nThey had written some stuff very early in the show for us, and Marg [Helgenberger] and I both sat down together and didn't really want that to happen, primarily because we were the only two women on the show. We talked about it, then took it to the writers and asked if we could not do that. They could butt heads but we didn't want them intrinsically at odds. The writers were kind enough to amend that.\n    \nSara's past comes back to haunt her when it's revealed that her mother murdered her father and she was then taken into foster care. How did that tragic past shape who Sara was?\n\nAgain, that was something the writers had decided early on, that a traumatic event in Sara's past had led her to where she was, led her down this road of working forensics. Nobody knew what that looked like completely until close to that episode, \"Committed\". We talked about it it, had thrown ideas around, so I always knew there was something she had, was protecting or hiding, and something that made her job extremely personal for her. That was wonderful thing to play and it raised the stakes even more. So many people have to work on professional detachment in order to go to work everyday like firefighters, cops, people who work in emergency rooms, and obviously crime scene investigators.\n\nIn \"Bloodlines\", Sara was picked up for a DUI. Did that make sense to you?\n\nLike many of the personal storylines for Sara, that came completely out of left field. Surprise. There was a little internal struggle for me because there was a part of me that didn't want that to happen to Sara. I am very protective of her so I felt that would never happen, that it was terrible, and this is Vegas where you can take a cab. I didn't want her to be seen as that vulnerable and yet at the same time, I did believe it could happen to her. It is a really human thing and nothing anyone is proud of. It is a moment in a person's life where they take a fall. Looking back on that tiny little character breakdown from season one, it was very much in like with something that could happen to her, although at the end of the day, I do think she is slightly smarter than that.\n \n \nHow was it having the CSI team split into the day shift and night shift?\n\nFor the writers, going into that season, it was obviously something they could do that would be different and interesting. How would the dynamics develop between all the characters? On a personal level, I was just sad I wasn't going to see George [Eads], Gary [Dourdan], and Marg a lot that season. I love working with everyone and there is no scene partner I don't adore so I was bummed.\n\n**During that period, Sara took Greg under her wing and they seemed to develop a strong bond. Was there a romance brewing between the two investigators?&&\n\nThere is always a possibility of a relationship there. Greg is Sara's best friend outside of Grissom but he was probably too young for her. I think she saw him much more as a little brother or friend. It has been awesome watching Eric Szmanda, who is the youngest guy on the show, and outside of work is one of my best friends, go from 24 to 33. Many, many many moons later, if things really fell apart between Grissom and Sara, I do wonder if there would be a time for Greg and Sara. I think Greg is completely over Sara but she holds a certain torch for him.\n\nOriginally, Sara was supposed to be a love interest for Grissom but they only seemed to commit to that recently. Did all that speculation and dancing around ever get frustrating?\n\nNo, not at all. That is one of the cool things about getting to do something over a long period of time. When they decided to bring it back, I had almost decided the audience was sick of the idea of Sara and Grissom. There had been this weird dance that had played out over a couple of seasons that had really led nowhere it seemed. For Billy [Peteresen] and I as actors, coming into season one, because it was on the page, we started the show playing it. It was the producers' decision to pull back on it. There is some truth to the idea that when they realized the show might be on the air for a while, they didn't want to play all their cards in the first seasons. For me, there is a wonderful feeling that viewers still want to know more about these characters.\n\nThings finally heated up in the sixth season finale when Sara strolled out in a bathrobe...\n\nThat was interesting because there was a different ending planned for the show, a cliffhanger, and we had already started shooting the episode. I got a phone call in the afternoon from Carol Mendelsohn and Ann Donahue together and they were like, \"What do you think about this?\" That's another great thing about working on \"CSI\" &#8212; the writers will actually call you up and ask you what you think about a storyline. They were definitely giving me the option to say I didn't want to do it. So I was completely surprised and quickly said, \"Yeah!\" It was very last minute and I thought it was an amazing Grissom scene. We rarely hear his innermost feelings. The show is so dark and the characters are so driven, they all seem slightly alienated and lonely by nature of what they do. To know there is this little light burning somewhere in their lives was amazing payback and what Sara and Grissom really deserve.\n\nWhat was your take on doing an ongoing arc like the Miniature Killer storyline?\n\nI loved the fact that we were going to take on a story that would go the whole season. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of becoming a victim of the serial killer, though. Maybe I wasn't completely listening becuase Carol and Ann did mention something to me about how this thing would go all season, that there would be something between Sara and the serial killer, but when push came to shove, I wasn't really for that at all. I was extremely protective of the character. I felt Sara had been victimized as a child, and had gone through so much, and had made such a heroic stand at not being a victim anymore, which is partly how she ended up at the crime labs. But it makes excellent drama and speaking of the season eight premiere, it was fun to shoot it. I am really glad I did it and have no regrets\n\nThe eighth season premiere \"Dead Doll\", had Sara in pretty dire circumstances. How was it filming that wet, deadly trap?\n\nThere was a lot of water involved. I am a bit claustrophobic and I've also been hurt a couple of times doing stunts so I'm pretty much the wimp of the cast. I'm the last one in line to do anything dangerous and would much rather sit in the lab with a microscope. Again, I was like, \"Why me? Please. Eric, George, and Gary love to do that!\" I had a few things working against me in terms of the physicality of the stuff. The cool thing about water and me is that I'm an avid surfer and I love water. The water stuff is fun; it was the two tones of steel hanging over my head that gave me the creeps.\n\nWhen rumors started circulated that you could be the killer's next victim, there was a &#8216;Save Sara' campaign. It must be gratifying to know your fans are so loyal.\n\nIt is amzing to me that after seven years, people would still be invested enough to take the time to actually write those leters or send those emails. It is almost intangibly flattering. It is hard to communicate how meaningful that is. If you don't mind printing just a huge \"Thank you\" and \"I love you\" to the people who have been kind enough to check out what I am doing &#8212; I am sure it is the reason I am still doing it.\n\nThere have been so many bloody and gory episodes. Is there one that really disturbed you?\n\nIf I was speaking personally about going to far, I'd say most of them. I am so squeamish. I am a pacifist so every week I am like, \"Ewwww ... we're doing that?\" One of the worst ones for me was a long time ago and based on a true story. It took place in Texas and was about a woman who was coming home, ran a guy over, and he stuck to her car. She was on LSD, was a nurse, and just drove home with the guy on her car, and parked it in the garage. We changed the story a little but so it had been a lawyer who'd been drinking. At a certain point, the person became aware that the guy on the car was still alive but they made the conscious decision to leave him to die in the garage. That story really affected me profoundly as a story and there was something about the autopsy in that case. His knees were both shredded becuase he had been dragged.\n\nThat is pretty grisly ... Lastly, what will you cherish the most about your time on \"CSI\"?\n\nOh my gosh. It would have to be the people I've gotten to work with ... the seven years of William Petersen, Eric Szmanda, George Eads, Gary, Marg, David Hall, Paul and Wally. There are those relationships and the ones with the writers. I never, in a million years, would have fathomed that I would get to work with people over that love a period of time and go through the highs and lows with them. That is the thing I will cherish the most. I doubt I will ever be able to say that ever again, that I got to go on a journey like that, with such a special group of people, for that long.\n\nWho Are You?\n\n Sara Sidle Profile\n\nCSI Sara Sidle has always led and eventful life. She first appeared on CSI as a replacement for rookie Holly Gribbs, who was murdered in \"Pilot\" (1.01), at which point Grissom was already referring to her as \"a friend\". It would take six seasons for their friendship to blossom into the relationship Sara seemed to long for &#8212; and just one more for the crazed \"Miniature Killer\" Natalie Davis to use this as a reason to target her. (She had another &#8216;office romance' during that time, with assistant paramedic Hank Pettigrew; they split because he cheated on her).\n\nBorn to hippy parents living outside San Francisco, Sara was taken into foster care after her mother stabbed her violent, alcoholic father to death and was institutionalized &#8212; as a result, Sara often identifies with victims of abuse. Despite her disruptive home life, she excelled academically and graduated from Harvard and Berkeley before training as a CSI in San Francisco, where she met Grissom at an entomology lecture. An intense CSI, she's not always able to detach her emotions from her job &#8212; in \"Bloodlines\" (4.23), when Nick wins a promotion instead o her, Sara drowns her sorrows and is caught drunk driving; Grissom collects her from the station. When she's suspended in \"Nesting Dolls\" (5.13) after rowing with Catherine then Ecklie over another domestic abuse case, Grissom visits her at home for an explanation. Telling her alcohol isn't her problem, he asks why she's angry and Sara tells him about the night her mother killed her father. Their subsequent relationship gave her the comfort and security she lacked and craved &#8212; but ultimately it wasn't enough to keep her in Las Vegas, and she left the City of Sin for good in \"Goodbye and Good Luck\" (8.07).\n",

Sara is sailing with the crew of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society!\n\nOf her adventure with Captain Paul Watson and his band of anti-whaling pirates, Sara says,\n\n Hello from below the equator, in Puerto Ayora. We’ve been at sea for over a month now. Man, you wouldn’t believe the crew - students, activists, scientists - the dinner conversations alone are mindblowing. And there’s even this marine biologist that reminds me a little bit of you. I wish that we could talk in person but this is the best that I can do. I want to apologize for being out of touch. I’ve been thinking about us a lot, though, all the moments. I thought we could survive anything. This trip has given me a lot of clarity. That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone think but now, for the first time in a really long time, I’m happy.\n\nWhen actress Jorja Fox - the vegetarian and PETA supporter who plays Sara Sidle - left \"CSI\" last season, I was afraid it would be the end of \"CSI**s animal-friendly plotlines. In the past, they've dealt with canned hunting involving discarded zoo animals, dog fighting, factory farming and chicken slaughter, and Sara's vegetarianism, of course. The show has been honored by the HSUS's Genesis Awards for its compassionate storylines; in a multi-episode plotline, Danny Bonaduce played an aging rock star/animal welfare crusader, who targeted said slaughterhouse in a PETA-like PSA.\n\nGiven that Jorja Fox is the high-profile vegn on \"CSI*s set, I assumed that she was the driving force behind these stories. I wonder whether she managed to convert any of her co-workers, or if one/some of the writers also just happen to be interested in animal advocacy on their own?\n\nEither way, I think it's totally awesome that Sara Sidle has defected - from Crime Scene Investigator to international, sea-faring, anti-whaling, activist-pirate-terrorist. Welcome to the dark green side, Sara. Just be careful who you extend your vegan potluck invites to.\n\nKeep up with Sara and the crew through Whale Wars, now airing on Animal Planet (Fridays at 9PM).\n\n",

But perhaps the most noteworthy season 9 addition is a blast from the past. Jorja Fox -- whose character, Sara Sidle, walked out on both her job and her engagement to Gil -- will return, just 11 months after quitting the show, to help solve the murder of Dourdan's Warrick Brown. \"Even though I agreed to make myself available in the future, I was surprised to be coming back so soon,\"&#8216; admits Fox, 40, who was vacationing in Costa Rica last March when she received the call to return to \"CSI\". Fox knew that Petersen was negotiating his exit but had no idea that Dourdan was leaving too. \"It was definitely an &#8216;Are you sitting down?' phone call. Like, &#8216;How many rum punches have you had?'\" Since the show was trying to make up for lost time due to the 100-day writers' strike, Fox headed to set last May to film this season's first two episodes. Though excited to be back (she'll appear in another episode this fall), Fox admits that things are way different from how she left Sara in November. \"This is probably the most in the dark I've been in the history of my character, even when I did season 1 and there was just a paragraph description,\" says Fox. \"We're very much in uncharted territory.\"\n\nThat's because the show has never had to account for the departures of three major characters. Warrick's tragic arc is wrapped up in the premiere (Dourdan is back for the episode), but Sara still has some personal business to attend to -- namely, that Dear John letter she left for Gil before fleeing the lab. As far as Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and Nick Stokes (George Eads) are concerned, Sara left to visit her mom in San Francisco. Fox is loath to spoil it for fans, but suggests Sara's relationship with Gil is about to take an unexpected turn. \"There's definitely more to say about this,\" teases Fox. \"When you see the premiere, all bets are off. By the end, everyone's going to be rethinking their idea of the characters.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the million-dollar question facing \"CSI\" this season: How will Gil be leaving Las Vegas? Fortunately, death is not an option. \"I didn't want to get the four-episode brain tumor, the countdown to Grissom's death,\" says Petersen. Unfortunately for Gil/Sara fans, a wedding is unlikely. \"CSI\" has never been one to play up the soapy aspects of its characters -- the most romantic moment to date was when Sara rubbed goop off Gil's face in season 2 -- so it's doubtful the show will start now (though we'd gladly settle for more sexual tension between Gil and Melinda Clarke's Lady Heather, who'll return in episode 5). \"You cannot try to create what you think the audience wants,\" explains Petersen. \"If you try to appease them, it's gonna feel hollow and false. All we want to do is the right things for the character.\" Which are? \"There are important changes happening in Grissom,\" Petersen continues. \"He's solving crimes, he's trying to deal with losing Sara and Warrick. He's not someone who's used to dealing with anything personal. That goes to the heart of what we're doing right now. Where does he end up?\"\n\nJust as important is where exactly \"CSI\" ends up once Petersen is gone. Fox, for one, is not so sure she wants to know. \"For me, it's not going to be the same show,\" she says. \"It'll never be the same again with the loss of Billy. He's the protagonist, he's the eyes of the show, all roads start and end with him.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

All I can say is -- good God, no. Look, I hated her poofy dress (and the curls she wore with it) probably as much as the next fan, but never in my wildest dreams would I have considered she was trying to cover up a secret pregnancy. That's why I was relieved to learn from a CSI insider that no such treacly twist is in the cards for Sara -- who, based on last night's episode, has once again abandoned her beloved for destinations unknown (more on that later).\n\n[...]\n\nBut those cases paled in comparison to a third story involving a man named Tom Adler, who unplugged his comatose wife. It's this sad case of euthanasia (and, if you really think about it, the confession from that murderous teenager) that seemed to offer some insight into where Gil and Sara are headed. First, we have the teenage boy who exclaimed that his cougar lover \"promised me everything and took it all away!\" (Hmm, might that also be another way of demonstrating that Sara promised Gil a lifetime of happiness before she took it all away by leaving town?) And then, we were treated to this eye-opening exchange between Gil and Sara as they sparred over Tom's decision to kill his vegetable spouse. Gil: \"Sooner or later a relationship...withers. You get angry. Sometimes, you need more than the safety of knowing that you are not alone.\" Sara: \"Then he should have just walked away.\" Gil: \"Maybe he couldn't. Maybe he needed her to leave him.\" Sara (first pausing for dramatic effect): \"Who are we talking about right now?\"\n\nUnfortunately, I never got the response I craved; Sara packed her bags and hit the road again, with no clue as to when she'll be back. The possibilities are limitless, like this clever (if idealistic) suggestion from poster Cathy Tockstein: \"When Gil and Sara leave Las Vegas, do you think they will try to get custody of Warrick's son to raise him as their own child?\" That's assuming she and Gil reunite at all. Personally, my guess is that Sara finally figured out that her boyfriend was an emotional deadbeat (Daddy smacked him silly during his already troubled youth!) and she finally gave up on their maddening backroom romance.

        "content": "Jorja Fox and Kirsten Holly Smith talk about the life and music of Dusty Springfield. \n\nFor millions the music and life of Dusty Springfield has grand significance. More specifically, as a woman who was producing music in the man's world of music making, a performer who professionally protested Apartheid (before it was de rigueur) and a household name who came out of the closet, Springfield's music and life meant much more to specific groups such as women, blacks and gays. She was truly an iconoclastic artist whom succeeded and failed on her own terms.\n\nAlthough she died of cancer in 1999, Springfield's modus vivendi lives on in the likes of television and film actor Jorja Fox and actor, writer and singer Kirsten Holly Smith. Friends for years, Fox and Smith found out they wanted to bring Springfield's life to the world â even though they did not realize they were on the same wavelength until Smith invited Fox to her one-night show on Springfield written and performed by Smith. Immediately smitten with the project Fox decided to back the production.\n\nDirected by Derick LaSalla and backed by a live band and backup singers, Smith will perform her (with additional material by Patricia Cotter) Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield February 7-24 at the Renberg Theatre in the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center's Village at Ed Gould Plaza.\n\nA world premiere featuring 13 Springfield songs (e.g. \"Son of a Preacher Man\" and \"Wishing and Hoping\") Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield chronicles Springfield's days as a wayward teenager to her rise and falls and rises to and fro stardom.\n\nBorn July 7, 1968, in New York, New York, to Canadian Ã©migrÃ©s the 5-foot 9-inches Fox was a fashion model from Florida before she began to study acting back in New York and becoming one of television's most noticeable new faces with her appearances as Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing, and the 170 episodes (and counting) as Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\n\nOff the hyper-melodrama television past, Fox eats vegetarian, supports vegan products (Matt and Nat named a purse after Fox) has pets, writes songs, plays guitar and is a co-founder of the experimental theater LA-based production company \"Honeypot Productions\" along with the pro-Sapphic songstress of the Murmurs, Heather Grody. (Who wants to guess where they got the theater's name? Go Fish.).\n\nAlong with Fox LN also spoke to the tall beauteous blonde Smith (as she was applying stage makeup), whose film credits include Isle of Lesbos and the upcoming Ninja Cheerleaders.\n\nLesbian News: Why did you want to put on this show?\n\nJorja Fox: I've always been a big fan of Dusty Springfield. Even many years ago I read her story and found it interesting. I wanted to turn it into a screenplay. Kirsten, who I've known for years, called me and told me she was doing this show about Dusty Springfield. I was like, \"Wow, ain't that a small world.\" So I went to see the show. I felt instantly in love. It was stunning, magical, and breathtaking. So I offered to get on board and now I'm the latest on this party train. Dusty Springfield is an iconic figure in music history. She was a pioneer in so many ways. Not only musically, but business sense, taking a political stand on certain issues, and she herself is exciting and amazing. I wanted to tell the story and I'm totally thrilled I get to tell it with Kirsten.\n\n[...]\n\nLesbian News: Could you elaborate on why it is time to tell this story?\n\nJorja Fox: It's always been time to tell this story. She was a very brave person, a visionary, and she really stuck to her ideals. I don't think she ever compromised her ideals. If ever &#8212; not just the world in general, but in entertainment &#8212; we could get something out of who she was, it's right now for sure.\n\n[...]\n\nLesbian News: Jorja, you mentioned her political stances.\n\nJorja Fox: She took a very early stand against segregation in South Africa or Apartheid. When she went to South Africa she had a standard clause that she wouldn't play to segregated audiences. After years of dodging questions about her sexual orientation, sometime in the 70's she grew tired of it and she started to be a little more direct with press. If I'm not mistaken, she was the first musician who was able to say to a reporter, \"Yeah, maybe I do sleep with women. I enjoy the company of women just as much as I enjoy the company of men\".\n\nLesbian News: How did her coming out of the closet free her of her artistic talent?\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox: Homosexuality, especially for men, was illegal in England until 1967. So the fact that she got into the press about it in the early 70's is pretty cool.\n\n[...]\n\nLesbian News: What do you think you have in common with Dusty?\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox: I don't know if I have a lot in common with Dusty Springfield, but she certainly is one of my heroes and mentors.\n\nLesbian News: In what way is she one of your mentors?\n\nJorja Fox: She was always true to her art. She followed her passion for art. She made a living at it. That was sometimes difficult. As Kirsten pointed out, there are ways to market people and ways to sell people and Dusty didn't quite fit into an exact niche group. She kind of stood up and did what she did and hoped that people would enjoy the music. She had great business sense. She took a hold of her career and took the risks to steer it.\n\nLesbian News: As someone who has been in the limelight, in what ways does celebrity influence creativity?\n\nJorja Fox: That's a loaded question right there \"(laughs)\". Celebrity can sometimes be challenging to creativity because it's easier for any artists out there to take risks if they're not already threatened by security or stability. As an actor, personally, I don't think anyone should ever feel comfortable. It doesn't matter how successful you get or how high you go, we all know there are flavors of the month, flavors of the year, and how quickly the tide can change. If I'm starting to feel comfortable, that's a warning sign \"(laughs)\". I would need to reevaluate.\n\nLesbian News: Along the lines of what we have been talking about with regard to media and celebrity, what do you think about these interviews where you talk about yourself and your work? Do they serve the work? Should the work speak for itself? Why do you do them?\n\nJorja Fox: I don't do a lot of interviews. I'm lucky enough to have been on TV every week for the past 7 1/2 years. I feel people get a lot of me already so I don't want overdo it. I would always much rather let the work talk. As an actor the less people know about you the easier it is to suspend the believability of the person you're playing or trying to portray.\n\nKirsten Holly Smith: Are you talking about The Actor's Studio \"(laughs)\". I absolutely think the work should speak for itself. I don't think it serves the work at all. It serves the ability for a person to see the story and come see the work.\n\nJorja Fox: Right.  \n",

The organization proposes a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses &ndash; not just protecting animals in the U.S. but internationally, since so much of the animal training and trafficking trade is based here. Similar bans have been adopted in Austria, Costa Rica, Hungary, Israel, India, and Singapore, with legislation being considered in Greece and the United Kingdom. ADI is requesting that Austin follow the example of Buenos Aires, to set a precedent in the U.S. by passing a citywide ban. Leffingwell confirmed the city has received letters from Austinites concerned about circus animals and supportive of a ban. \"You guys can be the first,\" said Fox.  \n",

Who, of course, was shot and (presumably) killed in last week's season finale. \n\nThe reason for the \"presumably\" is because Warrick, played by Gary Dourdan, will also be back in the show's ninth season, and also not in just flashbacks. According to Ausiello, Warrick will most likely be involved in what he calls a \"gut-wrenching death scene.\" \n\nThe reasons for Fox and Dourdan's departures were very different. On one hand, Fox left because of burnout and the desire to try something new. Dourdan, as TheCelebrityCafe.com has reported, was recently arrested for possessing heroin, and other drugs.  \n",

She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.\n\nShe was back for Warrick's funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues' face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn't look remotely upset, even though she said she was. It was like watching a surfboard trying to cry. \n\nI don't know how much more we're going to see of Jorja and her character Sara and I don't care, I can't see myself watching CSI again now until the new Grissom Laurence Fishburne starts. Although Sara did deliver one of the more convincing, authentic-sounding lines I think I've ever heard on CSI. \n\nIt was when she and that other cop went to Warrick's house to get him an outfit to wear in his coffin and his bed wasn't made and she said how she'd been to so many murder scenes, she would never leave her house in the morning until she'd made her bed and taken the rubbish out, in case she never came home. \n\nI could actually imagine homicide police or whatever saying something like that, if not physically doing it. Female cops especially. \n\nIt was certainly more realistic than George Eads's theory about the wet towel . . . it was towards the end, and they're gearing up for the big chase after the dodgy cop-killing cop, and George â Nick in the show â swans in to the empty hotel room and spying a towel screwed up on the bed, picks it up, finds it's still damp, and announces they've just missed him. He's obviously never arrived home at the end of the day to find a mass of towel somewhere strange, still wet 10 hours after it's been used. \n\nSara would never have said that line. Maybe that's why she's no longer on the show. Although from those ads last week she must be in at least one more episode â it looked like she and Grissom were doing some naked post-something cuddling from where I was sitting. \n\n[...]\n\n",

This has been an interesting study of adult male-female relationship in the workplace. We never made it blatant. We never made it cheap. They had an affair, but they kept it private because it would have changed the dynamic of the whole workplace, and their careers. They did the right thing for each other. They weren't cheating on anybody else.\n\nSo how do you feel about Jorja leaving the show?\n\nJorja's character went the right way. I think that's all any of us want. When you play a character for a while, you really care for the character. Jorja loved Sara Sidle as I love Grissom. I think she was very satisfied with the way the storyline evolved for her and for Sara Sidle. But we haven't seen the last of Sara Sidle either, you know!\n\nSo what more are we going to see of her?\n\nI can't really tell you because it would be unfair to the show and the audience. But just because you leave a movie or a show doesn't mean you can't come back. All I know is we want to maintain the integrity of the show throughout, whatever happens to Grissom and Sara.\n\n",

I enjoy chit chat with the Tallest-Assistant-In-The-World, Jeff, who is almost 7 feet and hilarious. On Jeff's desk last week, was a notice for a show at the LBGT Center, produced by Jorja Fox. I have a comedy pal who's name is also spelled Jorja and in the fever of the moment, failed to realize that Jorja Fox, the adorably gap-toothed star of CSI, is not my comedy friend seeking a voiceover agent, Jorja. Jeff informed met that Jorja had recently signed with my agency and he was going to go see her show. Thrilled that my agent-seeking friend, Jorja, had seemingly signed with my agent, I suggested to Jeff that we see her show together, as I knew her too! Last week we set the date for this upcoming Friday, and today at the agency, Jeff and I touched base about the show. In the midst of this Touching Base convo, Jeff mentioned that Jorja was very rich. I expressed surprise, as I didn't think my comedy friend Jorja, was rich and Jeff was like, \"Yeah, all those millions of CSI episodes...\" and I suddenly realized what a total schmuck I was and Jorja Fox is not my personal Friend.

But the paradox of writing a procedural is that sometimes even our favorite scenes (scenes that show the personal lives of our CSIs) aren't required by the narrative. We wrote the scene because, like Catherine, we're dying to snoop around Grissom and Sara's relationship. But at the end of the day, crime-solving trumped romance.

The kindest thing that the writers did for Sara Sidle was to walk her out in one piece. I had an amazing, beautiful, honorable, dignified exit.\n\nfont color=#660033How did your exit story evolve?/font It was decided she was just split from Grissom. As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous. In areas of communicating their hearts, it's never been a specialty for either of them. So perhaps if she talked to him, he would have been able to convince her to stay.

When I left in October, it was so decisive &#8212; everybody got me a good-bye cake. It's a surprise for me to be back, especially this soon.\n\nfont color=#660033Have you done anything liberating since you left?</font I cut my hair &#8212; a couple inches only but it was a huge deal. I kept the same hairstyle for Sara all that time. The character is very consistent, very steady, kind of stubborn and stuck. Little things like that have been fun.\n\nfont color=#660033What have you done professionally?/font Mostly not-for-profit stuff.

I watched as much as I could.\n\nfont color=#660033Are you ready to do more TV?/font It will be so hard to follow up \"CSI\". No matter what I do, it's big shoes to fill. If I'm going to do TV, then my loyalty and my heart belong to \"CSI\".  \n",

According to \"TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, Jorja Fox will be in the season premiere of \"CSI\". Oh, and she won't be the only former cast mate on the show; so will Gary Dourdan as Warrick.\n\nI know, I know &#8212; I can hear you now, how is that possible? Didn't he die in the \"CSI\" finale? When we last saw Warrick, he'd been shot twice and left to die in his car. Could the \"CSI\" have survived a bullet through the neck? He was slumped over the steering wheel, so he looked dead. And the sheriff shot him a second time &#8212; presumably a death shot to the head since it was an execution.\n\nAusiello's sources claim that Warrick's return will not be a flashback. He thinks we're in for a \"gut wrenching death scene.\" He could be right, they could go in that direction. However, \"CSI\" could think outside the reality box, too. They could go the apparition or ghost route. It wouldn't be the first time; there was the episode a few seasons back where the corpses talked, telling the story of how they died. That was definitely not real, but this is a fictional show and they can take a leap if they feel like it. \n\nMaybe Warrick will appear to viewers, aware that he's dead, but unable to cross over or something like that. Maybe he goes to his funeral or helps solve his murder? Any ideas? Tell us about them in the comments.\n\nAs for Jorja, there's no doubt she'll be back to see Gil. Even after leaving Las Vegas, she was in touch with Grissom. She called him on one episode which put a smile on his face, so we can assume the two are still romantically connected.  \n",

        "content": "\n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' season 10 will see a lot of Sara Sidle but none of Riley Adams.\"\n\nOne person in, another is out. While Jorja Fox is welcomed back as Sara Sidle on \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\", an actor has to be let go because the character is not working for the whole show. The unfortunate one would be Lauren Lee Smith aka Riley Adams, the crime investigator who joined the unit in season 9.\n\nExecutive producer Naren Shankar confirmed the elimination through TV Guide Magazine, specifying that Riley will not return for the 10th season. \"It was an issue of how we were feeling the ensemble was working,\" he reasoned. \"When we brought in the character of Riley, it got lost in the shuffle a little bit because we had lost Warrick, we had lost Sara, and then in the middle of last season Grissom finally left. I think, as a result, the character never quite found its footing in terms of the rest of the gang.\"\n\nAs compensation, Sara will be featured heavily during her 5 episodes appearance. On how she will re-enter the story, Shankar hinted, \"She shows up because the team is understaffed. The undersheriff reaches out for a recommendation and Sara says, &#8216;I think that person might be me'.\"\n\nFor the first time since the news spread out, Fox talked about her return. \"I never thought I'd be going back to work with people that I knew,\" Fox expressed her joy. \"I thought I'd be starting new things. That was a surprise, so I'm going back to work and it's with the same people who I've worked with for eight years in the past. I was thrilled! For me it was a huge compliment!\"\n\nAsked whether Sara's come back means similar thing will happen to her lover Gil Grissom, Fox played it coy. \"That will hopefully be a reveal in the premiere. They've prevented me from discussing Grissom at all,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nThe 10th season of \"CSI\" will begin September 24 on CBS.  \n",

        "content": "\nFollowing an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to \"CSI\" later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama's executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will \"reappear\" in a September 24th episode where viewers will \"discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a 5 year battle between Fox and CBS, and just two months after reports that Laurence Fishburne (who replaced series star William Petersen last year) has been unable to connect with loyal viewers. In 2004, 41 year-old Fox was fired from \"CSI\" over a contract dispute, only to be rehired a short time later. In 2007, following rumors she was once again being considered for dismissal, an online forum called \"Your Tax Dollars At Work\" began a \"Save Sara Sidle\" campaign, in which around $15,000 viewers sent the show's producers $1 each to keep Fox on the show. Fox later told \"EW\" she would be leaving the show to get a break \"from the commitment of a weekly television series.\"\n\nJorja will be making her \"CSI\" return on September 24th during the show's season 10 premiere.  \n",

Original series actress Jorja Fox will return for five episodes in the new season of the hit crime drama.\n\nJorja left the show in its eight season, but returned a few times last year in its ninth season for guest appearances. When we last saw Sara, she was caught in an embrace with her bearded boyfriend Gil Grissom, who had left the lab behind for good to meet her in the jungle.\n\nWhile I don't want to get into the great awww or ewww debate when it comes to the Gil and Sara relationship, I will say that it'll be nice to see Jorja back on my TV. The actress, with her serious scowl and gap-toothed smile, was always one of my favorites on the show.\n\nThe word is that Sara will be back without Gil. This happily clears the way for my long-held wish that Sara and Catherine Willows might someday find love among the Petrie dishes.\n\nThough, as long as we're wishing for things, how about bringing back Louise Lombard, \"CSI\"? Now the Sara/Catherine coupling versus Sara/Det. Sofia Curtis coupling is one I'd love to get into for hours and hours -- preferably with visual aids.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the Soup Chef herself, Lauren Lee Smith, has since joined the show. So many 'ships, so little time. So, are you excited to see Jorja back on \"CSI\"?  \n",

        "content": "\nThe latest puzzler for the &#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation': How to stop a ratings slide that began with William Petersen's departure last season and has continued into a new season, during which the granddaddy of forensic procedural dramas has lost its crown as TV's top-rated scripted series to &#8216;NCIS'? Answer? Stunts, starting with extending Jorja Fox's return to the show from temporary (five episodes) to indefinite.\n\nEntertainment Weekly's Ausiello Files reports that &#8216;CSI's' producers want to keep Fox's Sara Sidle around as long as they can. Executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told EW that Fox's return will last a lot longer than the five episodes initially slated. \"From our point of view, the more the better,\" Mendelsohn said. \"As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.\"\n\n[...]\n\nMendelsohn said of the mysterious Sara's return to the Las Vegas crime lab, \"The season is about bringing the [CSI] family back together again,\" yet that doesn't mean Sara's husband, Gil Grissom [Petersen], will be coming back as well. Mendelsohn told EW that there are no plans for Petersen to return, but said that future episodes will offer some explanation as to their long-distance marriage. \"We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,\" she said. \"Everyone on the team is a little interested. They're like, &#8216;What's the deal? Grissom's there, you're here, how does that work?' They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship. They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.\"\n\nInstead of a return visit from Petersen's Grissom, we'll see a three-way series of crossover episodes built around his replacement, Laurence Fishburne's Ray Langston. Throughout the second week of November, in the heart of ratings sweeps month (when networks and advertisers give extra scrutiny to audience numbers), Langston will rack up the frequent flyer miles with appearances on all three &#8216;CSI' shows as he tries to solve a murder case that takes him to Florida (&#8216;CSI: Miami,' Nov. 9), then Manhattan (&#8216;CSI: NY,' Nov. 11), and finally back to Vegas (Nov. 12). Severed limbs, organ trafficking, and prostitution rings will be involved. Fun for the whole family.\n\nBut can having Fox's fan-polarizing Sara settle in for a long stay, or Langston's cross-country crime-busting, can return &#8216;CSI' to its former ratings glory? Or do you think Mendelsohn and co. will have to persuade Petersen (like Fox) to return from his self-imposed exile? And if he does, will that strike fans as a brilliant move or a desperate one?  \n",

        "content": "\nIt's been two years since Jorja Fox left the grimy Las Vegas crime scenes of &#8216;CSI' for sun, surf and soul searching. But now she's set to return as Sara Sidle for a much anticipated five-episode arc on the series' 10th season (premiering Sept. 24 on CBS). There's wild speculation around the circumstances of her visit &#8212; Is another CSI in danger? Are Sara and Grissom still together? &#8212; and AOL TV grilled her mercilessly for the juicy details.\n\nIn our exclusive interview, Fox, phoning from a hammock on the shores of Santa Monica, was thrilled to dish &#8212; about, among other things, if she'll ever return to &#8216;CSI' full time, her reaction to some of George Eads' less flattering comments and her outrageous guest spot on &#8216;Drop Dead Diva' as a (gasp!) housewife. &#8212; \"By Sandy Deane\"\n\nWhy exactly does Sara come back to Vegas?\n\nWell, we're hoping to reveal a lot of that in the premiere, so I really can't talk too much about it. I think that within the context of the story that &#8216;CSI' had a rough year last year. They lost a close friend and a co-worker [in Warrick], and then the character of Grissom decides to go off into the blue yonder. They had two new members of their team, and it was just sort of a hard year for those characters. I think it's true that Grissom and Sara have kept in touch with those guys, and Sara comes back to see if she can help out.\n\nCan you tell us if Sara and Grissom are still together?\n\nI cannot. That's going to have to be a surprise.\n\nIn a poll we ran, 14 percent of the people said that they think something happened to Grissom and that Sara needs the CSI's help.\n\nYou know what I love? I love that folks care enough to talk about why Sara's actually returning. Even all along with the Sara-Grissom storyline, there's been a lot of people that really hate it. They hate the storyline, they wish it would go away. But, for me, I like to think it's a compliment that people still care enough to hate it.\n\nDid you seek to return to the show or did the show contact you?\n\nWhen I left the show two years ago ... the last thing I said to Carol Mendelsohn, the showrunner of &#8216;CSI,' was \"I'd love to visit!\" [laughs]. Last year I was there for four shows &#8212; under very sad circumstances for the most part. Gary Dourdan had decided that he was leaving the show ... We all miss him very much and we'll continue to do so. And then I knew, sort of in the back of my head that William Petersen was on his way out and that there was a good chance I would be involved in his exit. So this time around it came as a complete and utter surprise; I had no idea that they'd be calling, and I was thrilled. I'm having a blast.\n\nIs it just five episodes or is there any chance you're going to hang on for much longer?\n\nWhat we had set up when I came back was that I would visit for five shows, so that's kind of what we're doing right now. I think everybody's sort of taking things day by day ... I would have to say the premiere episode is truly thrilling and anybody who is a fan will not be disappointed by the season premiere. It blew me away, I read the first page and I was like \"Oh, my gosh, they've done it again.\"\n\nSo you're not closing the door on a permanent return to &#8216;CSI'?\n\nNo. I would absolutely never close the door on that, but I do think that now it's set up as a visit.\n\nHave you watched &#8216;CSI' since you left?\n\nYeah, and I caught up a bunch. It's sort of more intermittently than I had in the past. I really thought this season was amazing last year. I loved Laurence Fishburne; I loved Lauren Lee Smith. Everybody sort of had a pretty big hurdle to try and overcome last year, and I thought they did a spectacular job with it. \n\nWe interviewed George Eads just a few months ago and ... [he said] \"it's nice to be here at the end of the day without any divas or attitude.\" So just curious: What's your relationship with George? And why would he go around calling you a diva?\n\nWell, is there any accident that I'm doing &#8216;Drop Dead Diva'? Right? [Laughs] I'm looking at their cast, and it's a lot of, you know &#8212; diva, first of all, is a compliment, I think, in certain circles ... So there's a compliment in there. I think George didn't quite mean what he said ... Looking back on it, I think he's mentioned it to me more than once that it wasn't sort of what he meant to say, which happens to George a lot.\n\nWait, did you guys talk about this?\n\nWell, the only thing I would say to you about it in regards to George is that it absolutely takes one to know one [laughs]. And he's my brother, and I would walk across fire for him any day. But it takes one to know one.\n\nDid you ever have doubts that the show could sustain its quality after 10 years?\n\nOh, yeah. Many times. After almost every season I would think [that] &#8212; because it really does get harder. I think the bulk of that stress and pressure falls on the writers' room. But as I mentioned, that when I read the first page of the first episode of season 10, I was like \"OK, they're on it! Game on!\" They blew me away. And I had had that thought when I was looking at coming back. I was like, \"Wow, has this ship sailed?\" You know, just it's sort of inevitable, not because of anybody's lack of talent ... I just heard on NPR that &#8216;Law & Order' is starting its 20th season, and that's amazing! And that show is as fresh as it's ever been ... The fans tune in loyally to something that they know they already love; they're not necessarily looking for something too crazily different. But that's certainly a marker for the &#8216;CSI' guys to chase.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI was excited to go back to work. I had taken really almost a year off, and I thought about maybe even changing careers ... And having the time off and traveling, I realized I love what I do ... I'd love to do some theater; I'd love to do some film; I will continue to do TV if they will have me. I'm really excited about &#8216;Drop Dead Diva' on Sun., Aug. 16. That was a 180-degree departure for me, and kind of scary.\n\nWhat made you sign on?\n\nI love Lifetime; I'm a fan. Josh Berman is the exec producer of the show, and he and I had worked together for five years on &#8216;CSI' ... When I got the script, I was like, \"How are they going to pull this off? This story is just so not based in reality.\" But then Josh also sent me the pilot episode, and the minute I saw it I was like, \"Oh, my Gosh! They pulled this off!\" And Brooke [Elliott] is incredible.\n\nWhat were the other things you were thinking about doing if you were to leave acting?\n\nThat's almost embarrassing. I've had a very naive passion for politics my whole life, and I thought maybe &#8212; you know, on a small, local level, or a state level, a city level &#8212; that that might be something that I'd want to do. I could get into a gazillion different areas of environmentalism and really pursue that as an occupation because that's something that I'm really passionate about.  \n",

Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox's return to the current season of \"CSI\" will be indefinite, which means we'll see more of her than we initially thought this season.\n\n\"This season is about bringing the family back together again,\" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told Entertainment Weekly&#8216;s Michael Ausiello. \"Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.\"\n\n\"From our point of view, the more [episodes], the better,\" she added. \"As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.\"\n\nBut the extension of Fox's stay doesn't necessarily mean a return to CSI for William Petersen, who played her former supervisor (and current husband) Gil Grissom. Future episodes will address the unusual living arrangement between the two: Grissom teaching in Paris, and Sara solving crimes in Las Vegas.\n\n\"We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,\" Mendelsohn said. \"Everyone on the team is a little interested. They're like, &#8216;What's the deal? Grissom's there, you're here, how does that work?' They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship. They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.\"  \n",

After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she's arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on \"Drop Dead Diva\" which aired yesterday.\n\nThat detail's been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of \"CSI\" was announced. She's a soccer mom with a pretty grim past, apparently, and while I probably would miss the show, it's actually a bit interesting seeing her do just that. But wait a minute. What's exactly with \"Drop Dead Diva\" and its penchant for pretty high-profile guests? \n\nIn Jorja's case, it was a previous connection. Series creator Josh Berman worked for \"CSI\" before, and he came to her with that role. \"I just love the show,\" she said. \"It reminds me a lot of \"The Love Boat\", which was one of my favorites as a kid. It's funny but always poignant, and I'm honored to be a part of all the amazing guest stars they're bringing in.\"\n\n\"I've had dreams of doing some type of a romantic comedy for years,\" she added. \"William Petersen and myself, we drew on that as often as possible, but \"CSI\" isn't really the right genre for romantic comedy.\"\n\nHrmmm. Nonetheless Grissom and Sara still fell in love, eh?\n\nWell, the rest of her interview with the \"New York Daily News\" was about her role on season 10 of \"CSI\", and most of that we already know, but if you've seen her on \"Drop Dead Diva\" last night, you might wanna tell me if she pulled off being a prisoner. \"I've been trying to get into an orange jumpsuit for years,\" she said. \"I hope I pulled it off.\" Well, did she? Did she?  \n",

Reps from CBS confirmed that she will be returning in the tenth season premiere, which airs on September 24, as well as in additional episodes yet to be disclosed.\n\n\"We're thrilled for Jorja's return,\" executive producer Carol Mendelsohn said. Well, of course. The important bit here is the reason why Sara is returning: viewers will, she promised, \"discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the \"CSI\" team in Las Vegas.\"\n\nFox left \"CSI\" in the middle of the eighth season, but returning for several episodes in the ninth, notably the season premiere marking Warrick's death, and that episode when Grissom finally left the team to be with her. And their first kiss, yes. Her only other appearance will be on the Lifetime comedy \"Drop Dead Diva\", where she'll take a guest role in an episode airing next month.\n\nNetwork reps won't comment, however, whether Petersen will be returning to the show on an on-screen capacity. (Remember, he's producing \"CSI\", too.) I understand they're being tight-lipped-besides, it would just ruin the suspense when we discover that Sara Sidle is, in fact, Sara Grissom... okay, that's just me.  \n",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nItem two: It won't be that much of a reunion. The biggest item on the \"CSI\" front is the return of Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle; it's been confirmed that she'll be appearing in the tenth season premiere, and in yet-to-be-disclosed extra episodes. Obvious question is, is Grissom returning? William Petersen is, sadly, not returning to the role. At least not yet.\n\nBut executive producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed that some classic characters will be returning to the series. \"The last time we saw [serial killer] Paul Millander was in season 2 when Grissom had dinner at [his alter ego] Judge Mason's house, because, if you remember Paul lived a double life as a judge,\" she said. \"And we met Mrs. Mason and their young son, Craig. Well, Paul's dead, but Mrs. Mason and Craig live on. And we will see them in episode 2.\"\n\nAnd that, I think, is where Sara's return comes in. Remember when they hinted that Sara will be compelled to return to Las Vegas for some reason, right? Executive producer Naren Shankar spills the crucial bit: it's another serial killer on the loose. \"Starting at the end of our premiere, a brand new nemesis [will emerge] who has a very unique way of killing,\" he said. \"This time, the crime scene is always the body. We're calling him Dr. Jekyl.\"\n\nHe also revealed that viewers will finally get an idea about the ring Langston's (Laurence Fishburne) got on his finger. Which makes me wonder: Langston's going to be tested like this, so this season must be his big coming-in-circle thingie. And, being a fan-probably one of the few fans-of Langston, I can't help but be excited.  \n",

Then again, there are a lot of questions now that Sara's back on CSI. You know, stuff about her reasons for her return, or what she's been up to in between her first departure, her Costa Rican gig, and her return. Or whether something's happened between her and Grissom.\n\nIf you spotted that bit online where someone pointed out that Sara's wearing a ring in one of the promos, well, that might be your answer.&nbsp; (Update: [http://www.tvguide.com/News/MegaBuzz-CSI-SVU-Greys-1010090.aspx She did get married. Say hello to Sara Grissom for me, will you?])\n\nThis season sees the CSI cast settle down a bit, after last season's really tumultuous run-one leaves, two arrive, one leaves again. With Langston settling down to his role as a crime investigator rather than a professor, and everyone else getting reused to the dynamic, it's going to be interesting how things turn out.\n\nWe're on the tenth season, and tonight, the team-finally no longer undermanned-investigates the death of a young actress. It's a car accident, supposedly, but the crash doesn't add up, and in usual CSI fashion, something else happens to be the case. That, and Nick getting a promotion, tonight from 9pm on CBS. The photos are right here, as always.\n\nStill, we are left with all these questions. Or in the case of Langston, doubts. Let's see how this batch of episodes pan out.  \n",

And, much like the departure of Kim Delaney on her first season in \"CSI: Miami\", it's because the character just wasn't working well as everyone had expected.\n\n\"It was an issue of how we were feeling the ensemble was working,\" Shankar said. \"When we brought in the character of Riley, it got lost in the shuffle a little bit because we had lost Warrick, we had lost Sara, and then in the middle of last season Grissom finally left. I think, as a result, the character never quite found its footing in terms of the rest of the gang.\"\n\nAnd, perhaps, the fact that some \"CSI\" fans never really warmed to her, at least as a replacement for Jorja Fox, who left the show in the eighth season. Well, that's moot, then, as Fox's returning to the show for, according to Shankar, at least five episodes. \"She shows up because the team is understaffed,\" he said. \"The undersheriff reaches out for a recommendation and Sara says, &#8216;I think that person might be me.'\"\n\n\"The team has had a rough year-there has been a lot going on-and so Sara comes back mostly just to see if she can help for a while, because she loves those guys and she misses them,\" Fox told the magazine in a separate interview.\n\nHer five-episode stint is expected to address why she returns to the Las Vegas team-it's been revealed before that she'll be dealing with another serial killer-and all those questions about what happened between her and Grissom. \"That will hopefully be a reveal in the premiere,\" Fox said. \"They've prevented me from discussing Grissom at all.\"\n\nWhile it's not sure whether she's going to stay, Shankar promises that fans will be in for a treat. \"We're going to spotlight her for the episodes that she'll be in,\" he promises.\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "\nJust when I think we've heard enough about the developments on \"CSI\" over the past week-Jorja Fox arriving for five episodes, and Lauren Lee Smith leaving entirely-then comes more. Maybe you've already heard some of these things, but I shall point your attention to this article's title, somewhere up there. Yeah, exactly.\n\nExecutive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar talked to \"Entertainment Weekly**s Michael Ausiello, and discussed a little bit more about Sara Sidle's return to the Las Vegas lab for the tenth season of the crime drama. And, well, it does clear a few things up. Minor spoilers are up ahead, so if you don't want them, then stay away.\n\nThe first thing they clarified is that Fox's return is not a reaction to slumping ratings-it wasn't much of a decrease, considering it was a very tumultuous year for \"CSI\" last year, but it's still a decrease. \"It actually emanated from Naren and I,\" Mendelsohn said. \"It's a tough time for everybody in TV. We don't feel [it's fair] to single out \"CSI\".\"\n\n\"We had several major characters departing over the last year and a half, and it felt like the family had disintegrated a little bit,\" Shankar added. \"That suggested a theme for this season, which is really about family. We wanted to restore that balance of the family. And that initial creative impulse led to the notion of Jorja coming back and helping to assist with that.\"\n\nThe tenth season begins two and a half months from the events of the ninth season finale-the one where Langston finally kills someone-and sees Sara entering because, as we already know, the Las Vegas lab needs an extra pair of hands. \"One of our characters reaches out to her and brings her back in, unbeknownst to the other guys,\" Shankar said.\n\n\"Sara comes in and brings everyone together,\" Mendelsohn added. \"She helps Catherine understand that as the [new] leader, she needs to make the team cohesive and really fire on all cylinders again.\"\n\nAnd, of course, her return for five non-consecutive episodes would dabble on what's happened to her and to Grissom since the events of seasons past. \"They absolutely ended up together,\" Shankar stressed. \"Grissom is referenced in [Fox's first] episode. You'll get a sense of the good and the bad of the two of them actually being together for real. [We're] talking about a couple of very independent individuals who have decided to share their life together.\"\n\n\"And you have to admit that Sara and Grissom had a unique courtship,\" Mendelsohn added. \"It [makes sense] that their further relationship would also be unique.\" In other words, they did not break up.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, they're tight-lipped about whether William Petersen will reprise his Grissom role at any point in this season. \"The theme of the season is family,\" Mendelsohn said. \"And he certainly is part of the family-a big part of the family ... We're certainly open to [his return[, but no, there are no concrete plans.\"  \n",

The we don't need a stinking city behind our initials because what happens here stays here 'CSI.' The we aren't about making bad puns while taking off our sunglasses or tinting everything in NYPD's blue 'CSI.' You know -- Vegas, baby. It's just solid TV. Is it groundbreaking? Not especially. But week after week it is well done, infrequently gimmicky and beautifully produced. Tell me some of the scenes, especially in the last few Grissom seasons, did not feel cinematic in scope.\n\nWhat I have always particularly liked about crime show and procedurals is that the women in them are not superfluous. They work just as hard and are taken just as seriously as the men. And that's important. They also aren't constrained as tightly by the shackles of glamour. Are they glamorous and attractive? Duh, they're actors. But they don't need to show up in evening gowns or leather hot pants or six-inch heels. They can just show up and be competent. (Well, except when doing magazine photoshoots, but one victory at a time, people.) Which, in turn, leads me to the two founding females of CSI: Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox.\n\nWhile there may not have been a lot of warmth between their characters when the show premiered 10 years ago, what has developed is an organic affection and genuine respect. Like something you might find at an actual workplace between colleagues who have known each other for a decade. And, in the naughty recesses of my brain, I like to think that it's Sara and Catherine, not Sara and Grissom, that indulge in after-hours extracurriculars together. Now, I'm no GSR hater. I don't necessarily want to watch them together in silk robes, but I'm happy their characters seem to have found a happily ever after -- and even made it official. But, come on, look at the opportunity the producers are missing here. \n\nBut now with Sara's return for several episodes this season, they have can finally make amends. And the ladies are even teasing us about it via their new TV Guide cover story:\n\n:Would Catherine ever kiss Sara?  \n:Jorja: We did today! At the TV Guide Magazine photo shoot.\n\nOf course, the show already missed an equally golden opportunity when Det. Sofia Curtis (Louise Lombard, a.k.a. The Best-Strutting Butch With a Button-Down and a Badge Possibly Ever) mysteriously left the show. I mean, \"ohmygodhowfuckinghotaretheytogether\"?\n\nAnd while I had hoped for some sort of Sara Sidle/Soup Chef chemistry this year, Lauren Lee Smith's character Riley is gone before the season premieres tonight. Riley wasn't my favorite anyway, not because of Lauren but because her character wasn't given much to work with. So tonight, I'm going to celebrate the return of Sara, if only for a little while, to my favorite crime procedural. Plus, there has always been an unspoken agreement in the community that Jorja is one of ours.\n\nSo welcome back to my TV, homegirl. We've missed that gap-tooth grin. Now go get the bad guys.\n\n",

We came in and rehearsed it all morning like a stage play.\n\nThe scene took place in the emergency room and included almost the entire cast and recurring cast and several guest actors -- maybe thirty actors altogether. If I remember right, the camera followed Laura Innes's character, Dr. Weaver, through five or six rooms and several hallways.\n\n'My material was at the beginning of the shot and the end of the shot. The most nerve-wracking place to be in a scene on \"ER\" is at the end. If everyone gets it right -- through twists and turns and medical procedures and racing gurneys -- I'd feel terrible if I'd walk in at the end and mess up the entire take, which I did on more than several occasions. Now amplify that pressure by being at the end of an entire act! I was just a bit out-of-my-mind nervous at the start of the day.\n\n'Legendary Steadicam operator Dave Chameides shot that entire sequence. After several takes, as Dave would turn the corner near the end of a very long stretch of shooting -- through doors and rooms and moving forward and backward and every which way -- Anthony Edwards would yell, 'Cut!' and Dave would fall to his knees from the weight of the camera. I will never forget the thrill and the adrenaline of that day. We were all able to say that we shot an entire act of an hour-long drama in six or so hours, and I think it came out great.'\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "\nNow that the initial burst of excitement surrounding Jorja Fox's CSI comeback has died down, it's time to get down to business &#8212; the business of getting answers to some burning questions! What prompted her return? How long will she be sticking around? What impact will Sara's reappearance have on the rest of the team? And, last but not least, is Grissom next? CSI showrunners Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar tackle all those Qs and then some after the jump.\n\nJorja's back for five episodes, right?  \nCAROL MENDELSOHN: Yes, five non-consecutive episodes.\n\nThe show took a little bit of a ratings hit towards the end of last season. Did CBS ask you to bring her back as a way to halt the slide?  \nMENDELSOHN: No. It actually emanated from Naren and I. It's a tough time for everybody in TV. We don't feel [it's fair] to single out CSI.\n\nNAREN SHANKAR: We had several major characters departing over the last year and a half, and it felt like the family had disintegrated a little bit. We had people off in their own bubbles, and that suggested a theme for this season, which is really about family. We wanted to restore that balance of the family. And that initial creative impulse led to the notion of Jorja coming back and helping to assist with that.\n\nHow is she reintegrated?  \nSHANKAR: We'll learn a little bit about what she's been doing for the past couple of months. We're going to start season 10 in real time &#8212; two-and-a-half months since the end of last season. She comes in because the team is a little understaffed and overworked. One of our characters reaches out to her and brings her back in, unbeknownst to the other guys.\n\nMENDELSOHN: It's an interesting dynamic because each and every individual in the team is feeling that lack of cohesion. Catherine feels it. Nick feels it. Greg feels it. And Sara comes in and brings everyone together. And she helps Catherine understand that as the [new] leader, she needs to make the team cohesive and really fire on all cylinders again.\n\n*Should we assume that her happily ever after with Grissom didn't fare so well? They did end up together, right? *  \nSHANKAR: They absolutely ended up together. Grissom is referenced in [Fox's first] episode. You'll get a sense of the good and the bad of the two of them actually being together for real. Because we're talking about a couple of very independent individuals who have decided to share their life together. The first few months of that for any couple would be a weird kind of adjustment. In some ways, it's easier to be in love with somebody who's not there.\n\nMENDELSOHN: And you have to admit that Sara and Grissom had a unique courtship. It [makes sense] that their further relationship would also be unique.\n\nSo they didn't break up then?  \nSHANKAR: No. \n\nWhen's William Petersen returning?  \nMENDELSOHN: You never know when and if Grissom will show up on CSI. The theme of the season is family. And he certainly is part of the family &#8212; a big part of the family.\n\nAre there any concrete plans?  \nMENDELSOHN: We're certainly open to it, but no, there are no concrete plans.  \n",

But don't take Fox's five-episode to mean that Sara and Grissom's happily-ever-after was a bust. \"They're absolutely together,\" insists executive producer, Naren Shankar, who nonetheless says Sara will drop hints at trouble in paradise. \"We're talking about a coulpe of very independant individuals who have decided to share their life together. The first few months of that for any couple are a weird adjustment.\"\n\nSo, if it's not a breakup, what does prompt Sara to revisit the Vegas strip? Shankar and fellow executive producer Carol Mendelsohn maintain it was not a mandate from CBS to stem last season's rating slide. That said, the pair concede that the back-to-back-to-back departures of Fox, Gary Dourdan and Petersen, combined with the arrivals of Laurence Fisburne and Lauren Lee Smith, took a toll. \"The family had disintegrated a little bit,\" Shankar says. \"We had people off in their own bubbles, and we want to restore that family [feeling].

Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.”\n\nThe exact number of episodes that Fox will appear in is still being worked out, but Mendelsohn says it’s substantially more than five. “From our point of view, the more the better,” she says. “As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.”\n\nDespite the extension, Mendelsohn says there are no current plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to join his wife in Las Vegas. Upcoming episodes will shed light on the couple’s unconventional living arrangement. “We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,” she reveals. “Everyone on the team is a little interested. They’re like, ‘What’s the deal? Grissom’s there, you’re here, how does that work?’\n\n“They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship,” Mendelsohn elaborates. “They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers.

Sappy sendoff? Perhaps. Satisfying? You bet &#8212; especially since the last cast member to take a permanent hike (alas, poor Warrick) did it in such a depressing and tragic manner.\n\nTruth be told, I never believed executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar would keep Gil and Sara apart for long. That Dear John (Jane?) video she sent him earlier this season was a tricky-dick way to throw us off the scent, but if anyone seemed destined to catch a break, it was these two lonely hearts. And what a break they caught! I imagine the fans will argue long and hard about whether a prolonged and passionate buss is an appropriate act for a show about death, but I let out a gleeful gasp when those two embraced in that \"Survivor\"-like setting [...]. I don't know if these two characters will go on to get hitched &#8212; hell, I don't even know if they'll make it out of that jungle &#8212; but this is exactly the payoff I wanted if I were going to have to accept a CSI without Petersen.\n\n[...]\n\nWhat did you think?

She finally gets to see the other side of the law with her guest- starring role on Sunday's episode of Lifetime's \"Drop Dead Diva.\" The Lifetime legal series is about a self-centered beauty who dies and returns to Earth in the body of a plus-size attorney (Brooke Elliott).\n\nFox plays a woman &#8212; from Fresno, as it happens &#8212; who 20 years ago became an unknowing accomplice to a robbery gone fatally bad. Instead of waiting to be charged with the murder, she went into hiding. When her secret life is about to be revealed, she turns to Jane Bingum (Elliott) for help.\n\n\"I love playing the other side of the law. But I just kept wondering if I could pull this kind of role off,\" Fox says during a lunch break telephone interview from the set of \"CSI.\" After a yearlong hiatus, Fox returns this season to the role she played since the crime series launched in 2000.\n\nThe call for both roles came at the same time. Fox was interested in the \"Diva\" guest-starring spot because it was so different from the parts she is usually offered. She has built up an impressive career playing strong women on \"CSI,\" \"The West Wing\" and \"ER.\" The demands of playing those tough roles for so many years led her to take the \"CSI\" break.\n\nShe calls the \"Diva\" offer a \"perfect storm.\" She had wanted to work with Lifetime, it was a chance to be in a romantic comedy and she was reunited with Josh Berman, the former \"CSI\" writer and producer who is now an executive producer on \"Diva.\" \n\nThe call surprised her because the role is a 180- degree turn from her part on \"CSI.\" The last time Fox played someone on the wrong side of the law was in the first episode of the short-lived 1995 series \"Courthouse.\" She said \"yes\" right away to the chance to stretch as an actor.\n\nShe also liked the message of the show and her episode in particular.\n\n\"It is never too late to go back and try and start life over. The show talks about how you should never give up and there is a place for second chances,\" Fox says.\n\nFox says she thought about starting over in a new career while on break from \"CSI,\" but decided she was having too much fun to walk away from acting &#8212; something she'd wanted all her life.\n\nFox only decided to take a break from the series when she started to feel burned out, she says.\n\n\"My feet were pretty heavy and the last thing I wanted was the audience to sense that. Even when I left, I knew I would love to go back and visit the role,\" Fox says. \"So when I decided to go back it was easy to put the vest back on.\"\n\nWhether this is a temporary or permanent visit hasn't been revealed. Fox will be on the season opener of \"CSI\" when it airs Sept. 24. She offers no details of her return other than to say it will \"blow minds.\" As for how long she is back, Fox jokes she has to pick up a visitor's pass each time she shows up at the Universal Studios lot where the series films.\n\n",

        "content": "\nSara returns to a team in transition.\n\n[...]\n\nSorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they've opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She's badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris. It was somewhat surprising considering we never got to see them get married. No wedding photos were offered for show-and-tell. I'm hoping for a wedding flashback in a future episode.\n\n\"CSI**s season openers are never this packed with action and character developments. It's generally same ol', same ol'. It made for a very interesting night, even if I did find a few faults with the way things developed. With the dismissal of Riley, the promotions of Langston and Nick, and Sara Sidle's recurring guest spots, \"CSI\" seems to have everything in order to start the season off on a positive note.  \n",

His name is Billy, a 21 year-old Asian Elephant who in his natural habitat would walk 20-30 miles per day with a life expectancy of 60 years. Billy stands still, bobbing his head unnaturally in a small facility, as other elephants have in the past, most of which never made it to age 20.\n\n'It's time to close the elephant exhibit and send Billy to retirement and to an appropriate sanctuary,' said Lily Tomlin, actress and animal welfare advocate. Other supporters include Alicia Silverstone, Esai Morales, Bob Barker, Jorja Fox, Cher, Jennifer Pryor, Nancy Cartwright, Tippi Hedron, Robert Culp, Kim Basinger, Bea Arthur, Nicollette Sheridan, Jane Velez-Mitchell, Wolfgang and Maria Petersen, Bill Maher and Kathy Joosten, among others.\n\nKeeping elephants in a restricted environment is unsuitable to their well being, and 12 other U.S. cities have already shut down their elephant exhibits. We all have a duty to ensure the humane treatment of all animals, particularly of this and other endangered species.\n\nLos Angeles Councilmembers will be converging on Wednesday to decide Billy's fate.

For the Spring/Summer 09 look, we were feeling pretty damned good about ourselves and went for a 'top of the world' theme, deliciously shot on the rooftop of The Chapman Building (many thanks to GwG's dear friend and loft tenant, Matthew Vafiadis!) The location was divine, but I have to admit the whole inspiration for our 'world-topping' thing came once I knew the lovely Jorja Fox was on board to be our 'model'. From afar she just seems to ooze a relaxed confidence, right? Well, let me tell youâ¦ up close she does not disappoint! Arriving poised, professional and completely good-spirited, Jorja set the tone for a luscious photoshoot & overall brilliant day!\n\nSoâ¦ we let the champagne flow, munched on vegan yummies (curried mango & tempeh sandwich recipe here), soaked in the gorgeous day and went to work! [...]\n\nArtfully shot by photographer, Lelah Foster, the finished photos are a dream come true! Utilizing the open space, the soft sun and the colors & shapes of downtown LA, Lelah perfectly framed Jorja's smouldering beauty and determined gaze. I knowâ¦ I'm gushing, but it really was a perfect day. Model = amazing, Photographer (& assist., Chad) = brillsville, Clothing = perfection (of course!), Make up & Hair = a divine cross-section of editorial meets wearable (Big thank yous to Alyson Granaderos and Tamami Ito respectively!!!), and behind-the-scenes photos and general production helping hand = my husband & #1 supporterâ¦ total harmony!\n\nAnd to push the feel-good even further, once the GwG photos were captured, Jorja swapped her designer clothes (check what she wore here) for a PETA tee and posed for the campaign to STOP the clubbing of Canadian seals - some serious multi-tasking! At the end of the day, we are beyond thrilled with the results and so proud to have Jorja - and the rest of the team - play such important roles in the world of Green with Glamour!\n\n",

But when Josh Berman, a former \"CSI\" producer called to say he had a role for her on his new show \"Diva,\" she leapt at the opportunity.\n\n\"I just love the show. It reminds me a lot of &#8216;The Love Boat,' which was one of my favorites as a kid,\" Fox said. \"It's funny but always poignant, and I'm honored to be a part of all the amazing guest stars they're bringing in.\" Those guests include Rosie O'Donnell, Elliot Gould, Paula Abdul and Tim Gunn.\n\nFox said she enjoys the \"spirit of love\" on \"Diva,\" and though her character doesn't get to explore it in much depth, she was happy to at least get out of the dark crime lab.\n\n\"I've had dreams of doing some type of a romantic comedy for years,\" she said. \"William Petersen [who played &#8216;CSI's' Gil Grissom] and myself, we drew on that as often as possible, but &#8216;CSI' isn't really the right genre for romantic comedy.\"\n\nStill, Fox says it's been great to be back on the \"CSI\" set, where she's filming a guest spot on the first five episodes of the show's upcoming 10th season, which premieres Sept. 24 at 9 p.m.\n\n\"I'm a little rusty with the lingo and the gadgets. It's been two years since I've been at &#8216;CSI,'\" she said. \"I was in a couple of episodes last year, but I wasn't on the job.\"\n\nFox's return is just one of several adjustments \"CSI\" is making this season, including giving George Eads' character, Nick Stokes, a promotion and adjusting the wardrobe of Laurence Fishburne's Ray Langston.\n\nAfter a ratings slip following Petersen's departure last season, the show is shaking things up to draw viewers back to the once-dominant Thursday night series.\n\nFox can't reveal exactly why Sara returns to the lab, but promises that all viewers' questions (including ones about Grissom) will be answered.\n\n\"The only thing I can say is that last year was a really hard year for all the CSIs, within the context of the story,\" said Fox. \"Sara loves everyone and will always have a loyalty there, so she's back for a little bit to see if she can help.\"  \n",

With the TV critics' press tour due to start soon, expect more details then. You can also expect more questions, like: Does this mean Fishburne isn't working out?\n\nFrankly, I think the show's big mistake was making Fishburne's character come in as a junior member of the CSI team, pretending he was just another member of the ensemble. The only way to make that character really interesting was to spend some time with him; instead, the show's supporting characters were used to carry more of the stories, leading to some boring stuff.\n\nFox may be the most unlikely, ambivalent network TV star since ER&#8216;s Anthony Edwards. Will her return be enough to juice a show which seems to be slipping into old age doldrums? \n\nWill producers juice Fishburne's role enough to make the character interesting again? Or is this all just a setup for Petersen to come back during November sweeps?\n\nQuestions worthy of a CSI episode. Here's hoping producers figure a way to answer them in a way that saves the show.\n\n[...]\n\n",

Gone from Las Vegas since season 8, Sara Sidle is back ever since the first episode of season 10, currently airing in the US. There are many reasons to rejoice. TÃTUE.COM will tell you why.\n\nHallelujah! After two years absence, Jorja Fox is back on CSI. Thanks to her, the \"butchest\" of the CSI girls, Sara Sidle, is back in Vegas in Season 10. If this isn't great new, we don't know what is! Here's why:\n\nFirst of all, Sara Sidle is (almost) &#8216;butch'.\n\nHow to say this? The hair style, the vibes she send when she walks in a room, the displeased look, the sheriff star on her sleeveless vest, the leather jacket, the boots, the hands in her pockets, to add, the gun and that she uses a few judo moves on a suspect who wants nothing to do with her, is a bonus. It explains, Sara calls to us from a subconscious level. She's a delicious &#8216;butch' who doesn't talk about it. And it is even more emotional that that she has some difficulties with her relationships.\n\nYeah, but she got married ...\n\nThe romance with Gil Grissom, it's been there for a while. Kept secret from the other members of the team, their relationship was clear in the eyes of the public in season 7. But in season 10, its worse, they're married! Except that, and here is where we can relax, it's an \"unconventional marriage\". Understand that Sara and Gil don't live under the same roof. And not even in the same town! \"They're a very modern couple,\" mentions executive producer Carol Mendelsohn in Entertainment Weekly. \"They've found a balance that permits them to realize themselves in their marriage and in their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.\" We're breathing, like we were saying: married women, we know a lot of those.\n\nAnd, most of all, Jorja Fox is a bombshell\n\nWithout Jorja Fox, Sara Sidle would be nothing. The producers of CSI have finally realized it. A little late, sure, but we already know that. Thrown away like a dirty rag in season 8, the woman who also played Maggie Doyle in \"ER\" and Gina Toscano in \"The West Wing\" returned on a carpet of dollars. Planned for only five episodes only, her return is now extended for an \"unlimited stay\". \"Jorja has been the cement that permits the links to be rebuilt in the team,\" recognized Carol Mendelsohn. Yes, people love her! When the first rumors of her departure surfaced in the summer of 2007, tens of thousands of fans would have sent the money to the producers so Jorja wouldn't leave. A petition \"Save Jorja\" went around on the net and banners with the same message had been tied to planes that flew over Universal Studios. Her most active groupies were, without a doubt, girls! Included in those girls, certain pushed the limit until they created the \"approved\" fan club of Jorja Fox's Physique. It's called \"Bombshell\" or \"The Bomb\". First rule of this club is very serious: \"You must really be a fan of Jorja Fox's physique. For what other reason would you join?\" Maybe it's because she's vegetarian and she loves baby seals, and every year PETA selects her in its list of \"World's sexiest Vegetarians.\"\n\n",

        "content": "\nCrime Scene Investigation has long been the televisual highlight of the week in my house, so it was with some sadness that I tuned in last week to witness the apparent demise of one of the show's greatest assets: the relationship between team supervisor Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). What made this portrayal of heterosexuality so notable was not anything intrinsically subversive about its set-up (older, more powerful guy gets it on with younger, more attractive woman) but the refreshingly non-formulaic way it was represented.\n\nFrom the earliest seasons of CSI Grissom and Sara had 'chemistry', but in the six (six!) series it took to reveal they were having some kind of intimate relationship the story arcs of the show had not revolved around the kind of tedious will-they-won't-they narrative forced down our throats by the likes of Ross and Rachel (Friends) or Carrie and Big (Sex And The City). Grissom and Sara's relationship was not presented as the pinnacle of human fulfilment for either of them, neither did we have to endure them whining about one another in homosocial friendship situations, which is the ploy TV usually uses to subordinate all other significant relationships, especially women's, to the search for romantic love.\n\nGrissom and Sara disobeyed the rules of heterosexual romantic plot development by never hating each other, then deciding they were madly in love and instantly getting married. Instead they actually had both personal and professional respect for one another, and genuine shared interests (in, you know, searching hotel rooms for semen stains and peering intently at corpses). Obvious though this sounds when it comes to finding a compatible partner, it's amazing how infrequently we actually get to see it.\n\nWhen the time finally came to reveal that Grissom and Sara were more than just 'good friends' the announcement was unusually ambiguous. There were no grand declarations, no farcical misunderstandings, and no last minute dashes to the airport/train station to retrieve a fleeing lover in the nick of time. We saw them together, outside of work, in dressing gowns, talking. The implication was of post-coital soul-bearing, but it the details were left entirely unclear. The viewer could not presume either that this was their 'first time', nor that their relationship would be/had been necessarily normatively sexual.\n\nIt's this opaqueness which gives the Grissom/Sara relationship a distinctly queer character. The near invisibility of their intimacy continued throughout the following series of the show where we were given only glimpses, mere suggestions, as to what they might be up to after their shifts were over. Such a portrayal is not only characteristic of the kind of subtextual longing that is the subject of much slash and fan fiction, but also of the hidden-in-plain-sight mode of representing gay and lesbian relationships in much mainstream television - we only saw them kiss once (rather chastely), and personal remarks remained firmly coded. By the end of season seven, when Sara's kidnapping forced their relationship into the open, Grissom even had to literally 'come out' to the rest of the team.\n\nPerhaps I am attaching too much significance to what I see as the mildly progressive non-normativity of Grissom/Sara. Should I really be more concerned about the absence of out queer characters on CSI, or its persistent pathologisation of ethnic/sexual minorities? However, while it lasted Grissom and Sara seemed to offer the possibility of doing things differently. Maybe though we should be adhering to the CSI maxim of following the evidence: in the context of such an ambiguous relationship, can we assume the end is really the end?  \n",

Is she coming back in the same role with the CSI group or...?\n\nNS: In a sense, she is stepping into her old role but it's a little bit of a different Sara. The Sara who left was burnt out, was pretty messed up by the job and what happened to her but when she first came back there was a big question mark in her life which was the nature of her relationship with Grissom but that actually got resolved in a very happy way. What's really fun about having Jorja back is she lightens things up. Sara comes in at a moment in our premiere when the team is a little bit fractured and things aren't quite working very well. She's able to help the guys and Catherine in particular adjust to the new reality of the way things are now. It's a nice way to bring Jorja back into the fold and we're actually having a really good time with it.\n\nJH: Do we get an update on the Sara/Grissom relationship?\n\nNS: Yep, there are little bits and pieces there and little mentions that I think the audience will enjoy but you definitely get a little sense of what is going on with them. \n\n[...]  \n",

Plus, they share the same interests -- bugs, blood, logic. But still, them being together is an uncomfortable notion.\n\nThe are-they or are-they-not theories were put to rest when at the end of season six, Grissom and Sara were shown lying on a bed together ... erm, talking.\n\nIn all seriousness, this very successful franchise need not indulge on the personal lives of its characters too much because it's a show that does well when it's just about collecting evidence and getting the criminal. In spite of this unwelcome romance, the characters made the show what it is so it is quite sad that they are both out of the picture in the series' current season.\n\n[...]  \n",

Yes, we are going to discuss spoilers here, so run to your DVR or cbs.com and get caught up. We'll wait.\n\nThe departure of William Petersen's character from in front of the camera was mapped out in long conversations between two of the show's two executive producers, Petersen and co-star Jorja Fox, according to Carol Mendelsohn, one of the showrunners on \"CSI,\" who has been overseeing production of the show since episode one.\n\n\"The initial discussions began during the miniature killer storyline,\" said Mendelsohn in an interview on the \"CSI\" set this week. \"We knew at that time that Jorja (Fox's) character was going to move on,\" Mendelsohn said, \"and we discussed what that would mean to the relationship.\"\n\nThat story arc, which dominated the show's 2006-2007 season, involved the hunt for a serial killer who left behind perfectly detailed miniatures of her crime scenes. At one point, Fox's character, Sara Sidle, was kidnapped by the killer, and that experience was cited in her eventual departure from 'CSI' last season.\n\nSara and Gus had been a romantic item since year four of 'CSI.' Viewers seemed to like the idea of these two in love, though many reacted badly when the affair went away for nearly two years only to reappear suddenly &#8212; some thought it a shameless ploy at a time when \"CSI\" was getting its first serious ratings challenge in years, from ABC's soapy \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nWhen last seen on the show, Sara was leaving to work on her personal issues. Well, apparently she worked through them just fine, and sent word to Gus to come see her in the rainforest of Costa Rica. There the couple shared a long moment of passion as Thursday's episode went to black.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd then, in the closing scene, Grissom is walking through the thick brush in Costa Rica when he lights upon an exotic bug sitting on a leaf. He stops to admire the insect for a moment ... then marches forward into the arms of Sara.\n\n[...]  \n",

I'd always loved the show and had high hopes for it after Gil left, thinking Laurence Fishburne would bring something different to the mix and the rest of the wonderful cast was still there (Sara had left already) so I gave it my all but it didn't give back. I kept watching, hoping, cause nobody likes to see an old friend get sick and die, but it was losing me emotionally, and then came the return last night and \"return\" is really the word for it. I found it had gotten back its sizzle and excitement. Having Sara back and talking about Grissom and that they're married and she's just there because they were shorthanded and he's doing a seminar made it seem so right, and the wild stop-action opening, and the what's-in-that-body closing, added even more sizzle, as did the story that kept me guessing, the way their stories used to. Ray is now more into forensics, Catherine looked awful (green blond STRAIGHT HAIR) but I thought it was in keeping with her being \"in charge\" and overwhelmed, and forgetting what Sara so perfectly said that the thing missing is HER, and Nick now being into spiders, and Greg feeling he was the bottom man on the totem pole yet doing a great job on a supposedly unrelated case, even telling the bored cop how important it all was. I was SO delighted. I really think CSI (not just Sara) is BACK. I'm hoping it stays exciting and fresh and fun, and I'm wondering what you, my favorite critic, think of the NEW CSI!--Dorothy\n\nMatt Roush: From the dazzling opening tableau to that tease at the end, it was a very satisfying way to start the season. (Can't believe it's already the 10th!) Sara coming back, even for a limited run, is a very good thing, and so was the off-camera departure of Riley, who never quite fit in. Promoting Langston, hopefully making him more pro-active this season, was also a necessary move. Everyone knew going in that last season would be a transitional and probably rocky one for the show, but Thursday's opener reminded us that how solid the mothership of this franchise still is. But the competition this year is outrageous, and I'm afraid many weeks I'll be catching up with these episodes the next day or over the weekend. The mantra I heard in the office over and over on Friday: 'Thursdays are going to kill me!'\n\n[...]  \n",

Sara giving Catherine a pep talk about leadership.\n\nThe stalker-killing-the-starlet story quickly takes a weird turn when Ray figures out that the stalker is just a fall guy, which means, of course, Dillahunt's security dude is probably a part of it. The confirmation comes shortly after that, as does the big action showcase with all the gunplay and some old fashioned, glass-shattering kung fu from Ray. The connection? The seemingly unconnected John Doe death Greg is investigating which, of course, ends up being directly tied to the starlet's murder. And isn't that always the way?\n\n[...]  \n",

Langston, still hurt from the prison attack that ended last season, walks around with a cane and a sneer, like he's telling the world \"I am through with you all fucking with me!,\" which is just awesome. He's also much more confident at the crime scenes, and while he's still not Gil Grissom, he's become his own thing and that's just great. That vampire episode was brilliant, one of the best I've seen with Langston so far.

It had been a hard, hard week with challenges every step of the way.\n\nIt had been our most ambitious and complicated rescue mission ever, but it was the culmination of five years of investigative and campaign work, leading up to this amazing moment. Our field officers had infiltrated Bolivian circuses and caught the brutality on camera; the campaign was launched and Bolivia gave us the world's first national ban on all animals in circuses. Now we had rescued the first animals from Bolivia's circuses and brought them to freedom.\n\nActress and campaigner Jorja Fox and the ADI team had barely slept for days and would not sleep that night. However, as the aircraft rumbled to a halt and the cargo doors opened to reveal the precious cargo of lion crates, it was all worth it. Here was everything we fight for, representing the undercover investigations, the campaigning and lobbying to secure new laws, overcoming the logistical difficulties, and giving animals a new life.\n\nWhen the lions were on the tarmac and the crates opened, they began to roar -- first Bambek and then everyone. This time they were roaring freedom.\n\n[...]\n\nThe journey begins\n\nAs the rescue unfolded, we deployed two teams to ensure everything went smoothly, a rescue team in Bolivia and a reception team in San Francisco.\n\nADI Chief Executive Jan Creamer, Supporter Relations Director Lisa Mitchinson and vet Dr Mel Richardson, flew down to work with the ADI Bolivia team in Cochabamba.\n\nCampaigns Director Tim Phillips travelled from Los Angeles with the US team to oversee operations in San Francisco. CSI actress and ADI Ambassador Jorja Fox, who had written personally to Bolivia's President Morales when the ban was passed, joined the ADI San Francisco Team.\n\nDaily video diaries kept everyone updated with events; these were put on our rescue blog, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Jorja Fox provided video updates of the status of the US preparations. The diary is now available on DVD and online.\n\n[...]\n\nTouchdown\n\n9pm at San Francisco Airport, the gantry that had been set up for the President was bristling with TV cameras and photographers and Jorja and Tim were briefing the media. It was a magical moment for the team waiting as they watched the aircraft approach.\n\nFinally, the aircraft rumbled into place and the huge cargo door opened: the hatch opened, the ADI team waved and there were the lions in their crates. They had finally arrived safe and sound.\n\nEach crate was gently lowered from the aircraft and opened up so that they could be checked and watered. Bambek began bellowing to announce his arrival, and everyone else joined in. Jorja gave each of them a good drink of water, the crates were closed and loaded onto the trucks to take them to PAWS, and we drove into the night.\n\n[...]\n\n",

For ADI, who have rescued animals all over the world, it has been one of the most challenging rescue operations ever.\n\nCSI actress, Jorja Fox, who is with the ADI team in San Francisco waiting to greet the lions said, ...We had planned for the lions to come on Monday but that fell through because of a problem with the lifting gear for the crates at Cochabamba airport. That is just one of the headaches. We've had to contend with the Icelandic volcano, strikes, riots, all manner of logistical difficulties, mountains of paperwork, and even a Presidential visit at our arrival airport. I will just be so relieved when we see these lions roll off the aircraft. Then, on Friday it will be truly wonderful seeing them walk free in their new enclosure, to feel the grass beneath their feet for the first time ever.\"\n\nThe lions will be arriving in specially built travel crates and are being accompanied on the journey by ADI President Jan Creamer and ADI veterinarian Dr. Mel Richardson who have been in Bolivia organizing the move.\n\nJorja Fox will give the lions a drink of water after their long journey while Dr. Richardson and the ADI team assess the lions before they are loaded onto a truck to be taken to the ARK2000 sanctuary run by the Performing Animal Welfare Society.\n\nOn Friday at 11:00 a.m. the animals will be released from their holding pens into the huge natural habitat that has been specially built for them there.\n\nFox added, ...What a way to start memorial weekend. These lions that lived for years in a tiny, rusty cage on the back of a truck, really are home for the holidays.\"\n\nThe rescue has already stirred huge media and public interest in South America where Brazil and Peru are on the brink of voting on measures to ban the use of animals in circuses.\n\n[...]\n\n",

Officially, Jorja Fox left CSI in 2007 to do others projects. Unofficially, the 41 year old actress, tired of playing second fiddle, left after the production refused to increase her salary. Obviously, they came back with better propositions \n\nCalled to the rescue for a few episodes during season 9, Sara Sidle's character becomes a regular during season 10.\n\nNow married to Gil Grissom, the young woman gives an hand to her old colleagues from the scientific police. \"Sara is not a housewife [stay at home woman]\", explains the actress. \"She never hide her desire for independence. Grissom and her are a modern couple and have a very healthy relationship.\" The audience should besides learn more about them. \"Everybody wants to know what's happening between those two\", entertain Jorja Fox. \"This season has quite a few nice surprises...\" Only certainty : no little Grissoms are in the future. She remembers: \"When we decided to leave the show, I told William (Petersen) that I wanted to leave first, because I didn't want to play without him.\"\n\nBut since September on CBS, she is with Marg Helgenberger the new &#8216;two-star' team of CSI. \"Her comeback was very good for us\", confess George Eads, alias Nick Stokes. \"It was like being a family again. When we lost Jorja, we kind of lost the guitarist of the band. We played wrong all last season. We needed to come back to the basic, to the joy of the first days. This season 10 , more inspired, is one of the best.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

Apparently sensing that I was standing a little too close to be innocently passing by, Jorja stood up and, well . . . ran away from me. \n\nThe only positive thing to come out of this encounter is that the police were never called.  \n",

Rather, it will be Grissom's wife Sara (Jorja Fox) and his mother, who isn't Fox had left the hit crime series the year before Petersen, but she returned for his final scene on the show, the couple closing things out with a big kiss. Last season, Fox returned to the show for a handful of appearances. Her character sported a wedding ring and was occasionally referred to by her married name of Grissom.\n\nIn the current season, the CBS show hasn't made many Grissom references even though Fox has returned as a regular, appearing in a majority, but not all, of the episodes. That's why this news is rather exciting.\n\nPlaying the role of Gil's mom is Phyllis Frelich, the deaf actress who achieved acclaim with her performance in Children of a Lesser God on Broadway. The role was taken over by Marlee Matlin when made into a film. Interestingly, Matlin is also going to appear in this TV episode as Mrs. Grissom's preferred daughter-in-law.\n\nThere is a murder to be solved so it won't be all soap opera, and who knows, maybe Petersen can be talked into a brief cameo. Viewers can always dream.  \n",

EW has learned exclusively that Tony award-winning actress Phyllis Frelich will play the role of Mrs. Grissom -- and go head-to-head with the new Mrs. Grissom -- in an episode tentatively scheduled to air Feb. 3.\n\nHere are the details: A murder occurs at a school for the deaf where Grissom's mom is a professor. Sara (Jorja Fox) goes to investigate but ends up facing an unexpected challenge -- a surprising lack of affection from her mother-in-law. Apparently, Grissom's mom never felt that Sara was the one for her beloved Gil so the two women have a few fences to mend. The episode also stars Oscar winner Marlee Matlin as a school colleague who not only serves as Mrs. Grissom's protege but used to date Gil. Guess who momma Grissom prefers?\n\nSadly, William Petersen won't appear in the episode. (Fans are supposed to think that Gil is contantly on the move so he and Sara maintain a long-distance relationship.) But the story is a continuation of an arc that started way back in season one's memorable ...Sound of Silence\" episode, in which we first learn that our hero can sign because he grew up with a deaf mother.\n\nFrelich, who is deaf, won a Tony Award for her work in the 1980 Broadway production of Children of a Lesser God -- the play that inspired the movie of the same name that starred Matlin, who won an Oscar for her role. Frelich has also appeared in numerous TV shows, including ER, Diagnosis: Murder and L.A. Law.\n\n",

Difficult? Well sometimes [it] all can be difficult as you want to make sure you give the coordinator what they want and [also give it] 100%... I must say ... this will sound funny, BUT on an episode of CSI... I think a few seasons back I was playing a passenger on a community bus and I was sitting in the very back while they were shooting.

Now the motion sickness, yes, was the problem BUT not letting the crew and stunt coordinator know how bad it really was [because] I was a stunt-woman ... [I] had to be tough and getting motion sickness on a bus was not so tough! I really wanted to throw up but truly held it in [until] we finally got off and was able to get some soda water! THAT was the most terrifying/difficult job so far... not letting anyone know how bad it was! HA HA.\n\nJAA: We've seen you before on* CSI* in the episode The Gone Dead Train in season nine.

The CBS show wrote Sara out during season eight, and she bowed out by leaving Grissom (William Petersen) a letter explaining that she had to go away to deal with personal demons. She popped back in for the first couple of episodes in season nine, then reappeared very briefly toward the middle of that season when Grissom also left and met up with her in Costa Rica.\n\nSara then stayed absent until the start of the 10th season, when she returned to the crime lab to help because of short staffing, due in part to the death of Warrick (Gary Dourdan). Sara declared then that she and Grissom are married now, and he's in Paris teaching at the Sorbonne. Evidently in their case, absence does make the heart grow fonder &ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp;.&ensp; and will continue to, since Sara is expected to remain on board for the show's next season.  \n",

They symbolize everything that is wrong with using animals to entertain people in circuses and that will be vividly clear when they run free in their new home. What a way to start memorial weekend. These lions really are home for the holidays.\"\n\nAt 11am, Friday May 28, the lions will be released into the wonderful new natural habitat that ADI have constructed in partnership with the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) who run the world-renowned, 2,300 acre, ARK2000.\n\nPat Derby, President and Founder of the Performing Animal Welfare Society, said, ...Animal Defenders International contacted PAWS last year about providing a permanent home for the African lions remaining in Bolivia. Because we have ARK2000, our 2,300-acre sanctuary in San Andreas, California, we were happy to be able to help.\"\n\nEd Stewart, PAWS' Sanctuary Director, added, \"We have been busy developing plans for the new lion habitat. Each lion has his or her own denning area and a vast natural habitat full of trees, shrubs and grasses.\n\n...The next few weeks will be very busy as we carefully evaluate each animal and determine if any necessary medical treatments may be required. Each of the lion's diets will be assessed and progress reports will be updated several times each day.\n\n...We are all grateful to Bob Barker for his support of our sanctuary. As with every animal at PAWS, we are committed to providing life-time care. Each of the new lions will now have the peace and freedom to do as they please. They can nap or roam, sunbathe or explore. It's their home and they will make their own choices.\"\n\nDerby said, ...We congratulate ADI for their tireless efforts to rescue these animals and we applaud the government of Bolivia and its good citizens for banning the cruel exploitation of animals used in circuses. This is certainly a landmark victory and we hope that other countries around the world, including the United States, will take notice and follow suit.\"\n\nJan Creamer, the ADI President who has been in Bolivia coordinating the rescue, said: \"With the Congresses of Peru, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile all considering legislation to ban animal circuses, this rescue is not merely symbolic, it shows that we are prepared to make a real commitment to ensure that bans on animal circuses can be fully implemented and animals can be saved.\n\n...As other animals need homes we will be assessing these on a case by case basis. With these lions there were clear welfare and public safety issues, When dealing with lions there are not only welfare and public safety issues, we are therefore delighted to be working with PAWS who have enormous experience with big cats and a reputation for setting the highest standards in animal care.\"\n\nThe ADI rescue operation was backed by Bob Barker.  \n",

        "content": "\nAfter a four year break, Jorja's returning to the hit crime drama series CSI and MSN Entertainment has got the latest on her character, Sara Sidle and what's up and coming for Season 10 of CSI.\n\nQ: Tell us what is it like leaving CSI and then coming back again after a break?\n\nA: Well when I was on CSI, I was really exhausted and literally crying. I said to the executive producer when I left that I would love to visit sometime. I think they heard I wanted to come back because I took a four year break to try and stay out of Hollywood. When they heard I was going back to work they called me to come and visit and I was completely flattered and surprised that they will ever call again. I was excited to return because in some ways I was seeing old friends again but in another way this was brand new to me. So I went in there mentally thinking that I wanted to start fresh which is very exciting. I remember being so slow at the beginning when I had to learn the ropes of everything again like a new person. I was holding up many scenes making the day so much longer. But now I'm much up to speed again.\n\nQ: How did the other cast members react to your return especially the newest cast member, Laurence Fishburne who plays Dr. Raymond Langston?\n\nA: He has been so kind and so gracious and even the rest of the old cast members, they are so kind and so very patient with me.\n\nQ: Sarah Sidle has always had a moody presence on the show. Is she a happier person in Season 10? Did she find happiness away from the streets of Las Vegas? Also, did you manage to find your own happiness away from CSI?\n\nA: Yes and yes. I have really tried to bring a change to Sara this year by trying to bring a sort of more joyful presence in her. She left to bury her ghosts and the idea is she comes back as if she never separated with the rest. Now that she's not fighting her own demons she doesn't have to be as dark about her stories she's involved in. That's the conscious effort on my path this year. I was so tired when I left this show.I was so lucky to be able to do 12 years in a row of primetime television, stage and other various pieces before CSI.\n\nQ: Does Sara's return in season 10 bring back some of the old magic now that two of the original cast members, Warrick and Grissom are gone?\n\nA: Oh, I don't think that's a question for me but for the fans. (Laughs) Originally I never thought I would to return without William Peterson there. He and I worked for so many years and I couldn't imagine the show without him. I miss him and the both of them are irreplaceable characters on the show. However, it has been so fun to be back on the show and work with everybody. It has been a fantastic experience working with William. He really is a great guy and a terrific actor.\n\nQ: You have been playing the character of Sara for a long time now; do you find any similarities between you and her?\n\nA: All the time. I'll buy a skirt put in the closet and six months later think who bought that skirt! (Laughs) I'm really similar to Sarah and it has been a great advantage for me. Playing this character for 10 years really helps if I'm like her or if we have small things in common. I hope that little things of her rub off on me. She's very brave and she's much smarter than me. Also, Sara is very serious and focused. However, I'm also glad we're different in some ways because sometimes when I put on my jacket I feel like her and I have never experienced that before.\n\nQ: In CSI, you have to say a lot of technical terms and there's a lot of to memorize. Was it tough for you?\n\nA: Yes it was tough but we did a lot of research at the beginning of the show. After returning to the show again, I had difficulty trying to remember the technical terms or even some of the simple things like opening a kit box. Luckily my cast mates were really patient but it was very embarrassing. After being back for six months I'm slowly getting my pace again.\n\nQ: If you had to choose your favourite scenes in CSI, what will you pick?\n\nA: I would say thescenes with William Peterson. (Laughs) He was a great guy and also it was rare wherewe had scenes together which makes it so special especially the scene at the end where they kissed. I was afraid that coming back would be weird because it almost seemed the story had ended there.\n\nQ: The Sara-Griffith romance has sparked much debate to fans as some love it but some hate it. Will there be more of Sara and Griffith this season? And why do some fans really protest over this romance?\n\nA: I guess it's a good thing. I've question myself that several times but the show's had a history where half of the fans want more personal storylines and half of the fans who just want to see the show. So whenever the writers' are telling a story they are always disappointing someone. A couple of years ago, the writers' decided to just follow their hearts because they are always going to let somebody down no matter which story they are telling. For me and my ego, at least the people hate the story but the emotional response is strong enough. It is better than to not care about the show.\n\nQ: After 10 seasons, CSI has shown the fans almost everything, are there any surprises left and what can the fans expect?\n\nA: Yes there are many surprises. We haven't done so many stories on characters and there is more possibility of further venturing into that like Catherine is finally going to get a love interest. (Laughs) She's been waiting a long time for this. As for stories, sadly there would not be a shortage of stories of crime and violence in America. It's a sad fact actually but it is really good for our show.\n\nQ: What are your thoughts on the popularity of CSI? It has managed to have two have other spin-offs CSI: New York and CSI: Miami.\n\nA: It's always a surprise. I and my co-workers still are surprised that after 10 years we're still going strong. It's definitely a compliment to the show and I guess I do wonder whether the audience we get are starting to look for other things as you mention there are so many other shows and so many different stories. Unfortunately there's no shortage of stories in America asit has so much stories to tell. It's just been a great magic carpet ride. And if I do stand back and observe objectively, I would say the show's got a few more years of life in it.\n\nQ: What's the best thing about being Jorja Fox right now?\n\nA: I think the best thing is things could be a lot worse. I'm a very lucky person. I was able to take a year off which was a very terrifying risk and when I was done with my year off, the people I love and admired who I worked with for so long welcomed me back as if I never left. That's a really nice feeling. They took me in their arms and told me let's go to work.\n\nQ: What's the worst thing about being you right now?\n\nA: The worst thing is we had some crazy weather over here and the hardest thing about filming is not knowing whether we will be filming in the rain or freezing cold temperature.\n\nQ: I'm sure you're a fan of many actors and directors but are there any directors you would like to work with in the future?\n\nA: Oh My God, there are so many. Right now I would like to work with James Cameron.  \n",

        "content": "\nGrowing up in rural Florida, *CSI *actress Jorja Fox was aware of the dark world of dogfighting. But she didn't know all the dirty details until she teamed with the Humane Society of the United States to help with their End Dogfighting campaign. \"The more you know, the less you want to know,\" Fox tells PEOPLEPets.com. \"It's terrifying.\"\n\nFox is in Chicago to host this weekend's [http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2010/02/spotlight\\humane\\chicago\\021210.html Spotlight Humane: Chicago], an annual benefit to raise funds for [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/dogfighting/end\\dogfighting.html End Dogfighting in Chicago]. \"I'm so excited,\" she says. \"When I heard about this project last spring, I called the Humane Society and said if they wanted help, to call on me. It's a brilliant program.\" Fox calls it a \"triple-win,\" as the community-based initiative works from a grassroots level to get kids and adults off the dogfighting circuit and into free dog-training classes and other humane educational programs — saving dogs in the process. Launched in 2006, it expanded to Atlanta in 2008. \n\n\"Pit bulls are smart and healthy — they can do so much,\" Fox says. \"So the organization works to get kids showing that off, and getting excited about that, instead of falling into the dark side.\" Fox explains that it's not only pit bulls at risk, either. \"Dogs like Malteses and Jack Russell terriers end up getting stolen in communities where kids are dogfighting, used as training material for the pit bulls,\" she says. \"It's awful.\" \n\nOne dog that's safe from the dark world of dogfighting? Fox's rescue boxer pup Ali. \"She's 13 years old, so she's elderly,\" Fox jokes. \"If she were a human she'd have a cane and hearing aids!\" Adopted by the actress when she was just 10 months old, she's \"been with me through everything,\" Fox says. \"It's the oldest comment in the book, but she's my best friend.\" \n\nFox hopes that her work with End Dogfighting will result in many more happy human-dog endings, just like hers. \"If you're not treating your animal well, you'll never know what a great force they can be in your life,\" she says. \"They're healers, lovers, friends. They make life fun.\" \n\n",

Hon gÃ¶r vad hon kan fÃ¶r att stoppa de lagbrott som pÃ¥gÃ¥tt sedan 1988 genom att skriva ett Ã¶ppet brev till stadsminister Fredrik Reinfeldt, dÃ¤r hon vÃ¤djar om att minkfarmerna ska fÃ¶rbjudas.\n\n* OPEN LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF SWEDEN - AUGUST 17, 2010*\n\n*His Excellency Fredrik Reinfeldt  \nPrime Minister of Sweden/p \n\nDear Mr. Prime Minister,\n\nI am writing on behalf of my friends at the Animal Rights Alliance to ask that you please make a strong statement against cruelty to animals by banning fur farms in Sweden. Please take a moment to view footage from the Animal Rights Alliance's recent undercover investigation of 18 Swedish fur farms. After watching the footage, I hope you will agree that the way animals suffer and die in this industry violates Sweden's Animal Welfare Act, which clearly states that animals bred for fur production should be kept in such a way that promotes their health and allows them to engage in natural behavior.\n\nMinks are semi-aquatic, solitary animals who may occupy up to 2,500 acres of wetland habitat in the wild. On fur farms, minks are crammed into wire cages and are never allowed to feel the earth under their feet or dive into a cool stream. As seen in the Animal Rights Alliance's undercover video, the crowding and confinement on fur farms prevents minks from taking more than a few steps in any direction, and they often go insane and resort to self-mutilation and cannibalism.\n\nAs you know, fox farming has already been phased out in Sweden because of strict regulations. Won't you please consider joining a host of other countries--including Austria, Croatia, and the U.K.--in banning fur farming altogether? I can be reached via DjurrÃ¤ttsalliansen at 0046 76 230 12 00.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJorja Fox/em  \n",

        "content": "\nWHEN she announced that she was taking a break from acting three years ago, CSI fans flew planes over the Universal Studios film sets in California in protest.\n\nBut the banners they used, which read &#8216;Keep Jorja Fox on CBS', can now be kept away. \n\nThat's because Jorja Fox, 42, will reprise her role as tough cookie forensic scientist Sarah Sidle on hit crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's 10th season. \n\nIncidentally, she and CSI co-star George Eads were fired from the show in 2004 over a work dispute. \n\nIt was eventually resolved in over a week and the two were rehired by TV network CBS. \n\nReturning to the series, Fox found that some things haven't changed. She told The New Paper in a phone interview from Los Angeles: &#8216;What surprises me is that so much time has passed and yet what's still tough about filming CSI are the elements. \n\n&#8216;We can be working an entire week in the rain and the next, around fires. The violence (depicted in the murder cases) is also something that is hard to bear. \n\n&#8216;That is why I always watch Disney films, romantic comedies and take little trips so that I can stay away from that side of life.' \n\nGiven a choice, the sassy brunette with the signature gap between her front teeth would rather be on rival drama series Lost. \n\nThe New York native loves its science fiction theme. \n\nThen there's the fact that Lost is shot in Hawaii, which appeals to the avid surfer in her. \n\n&#8216;I remind my manager to call them (the Lost producers) every year to remind them that I want to be on their show. \n\n&#8216;If I could, I would want to play one of The Others (the show's antagonists),' she said. \n\nFor now, the actress is happy to reunite with the CSI cast, who were &#8216;too busy' to hang out with her when she was on her hiatus. \n\nShe said she was surprised and flattered when CSI's producers asked her to return to the series. It has been reported that her role has been extended indefinitely. \n\nA big perk of playing Sidle, she said, is getting to chase bad guys, rappel down hillsides and rescue kids out of burning buildings. \n\nAnd for someone who hasn't been to Asia, it was a real eye-opener when she got to watch a montage of dubbed CSI episodes that the series' international department had put together. \n\n&#8216;It amazes me that the show is played in so many parts of the world like Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore. \n\n&#8216;So I got to see myself speak in 20 different languages. I couldn't believe it. I can barely speak English,' Fox joked. \n\nSo what can we expect in the new season, which premieres over AXN (StarHub Ch 19) on 24 Feb at 10pm? \n\nCSI's ninth season, which saw the former regular returning as a guest star for three episodes, ended with Sidle and love interest Gil Grissom (William Petersen, who has since left the show) sharing a passionate kiss in the jungle. \n\nIn Season 10, Sidle and Grissom are married and living in Paris. \n\nLucky in love \n\nFox had great praise for former co-star Petersen, whom she said was smart, funny and passionate. \n\nShe admitted that Sidle has been lucky in love on the series, having had paramedics and even coroner's assistants after her. \n\nBut if Sidle hadn't ended up with Grissom, who does Fox think would've been her other choice? \n\n&#8216;People tend to think that Grissom is a little too old for Sarah and Greg Sanders (played by Eric Szmanda) is a little too young for her. But Greg has matured a lot, so Sarah would have chosen him.' \n\nHopefully, Fox is here to stay. \n\n&#8216;If CSI were to ever end, what I would want to take from the hospital set are these '70s-looking paintings that are hung in the corridor. \n\n&#8216;I would also take the metallic cabinets from the autopsy room and maybe a skeleton or two,' she said with a laugh.  \n",

While CSI is ailing the United States, the actress puts things in the clear.

I'll decide January if I want to continue. Turn a few episodes for me. That leaves me free time for other activities. \n\n*Why has it taken so long? *\n\nJ.F.: To be honest, I hesitated to re-sign.

I started to feel my energy wane and I fear that this is way to the screen. \n\n*What made you finally decide? *\n\nJ.F.: When I decided to continue, it was because I felt the whole team, from actors to writers, were in tune.\n\n*Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows in the series) has it, decided to leave. You understand her choice? *\n\nJ.F.: But nothing says she won't change her mind. (She smiles.)

He signed his contract only two days before the beginning of shooting. We felt a certain tension on the set. \n\n*These hesitations and these departures, are they linked with the salary increase of employees involved? *\n\nJ.F.: I don't think so.

So we understand that we should also tighten our belts. \n\n*People say the show is out of steam in the U.S., actors are leaving ...

        "content": "\nThe fans didn't, and neither could Jorja Fox, who's reprising the role in CSI\n\nYOU know how entwined the character you play on screen is to your real life when die-hard fans raised enough money to fly banner-bearing planes over a television network demanding to keep your character from leaving.\n\nOr when your name is Jorja Fox and a silly reporter (that would be me) greets you over the phone with an unthinking \"Hi, Sara! How are you?\"\n\nThe 42-year-old actress, laughing after this embarrassed reporter realised her fumble, said: \"It's okay! A lot of people do that.\"\n\nFox reprises her fan-favourite role as moody, no-nonsense forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the popular crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's 10th season after more than a year's break.\n\n\"I felt bad,\" she told Today of her departure. \"People were showing support, but it was actually my fault that I was leaving. I had made the decision and it was a hard one to make.\n\n\"I left CSI because I was exhausted and I wanted to take some time off. I was literally crying, but I said to the executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, &#8216;I'd love to visit sometime,'\" Fox said about her controversial and abrupt departure. \"I never thought they would ever call again!\"\n\nAnd it seems after playing a character for 10 years, it really is hard to completely get away from her - even with a self-imposed break to write, travel and produce a play.\n\n\"I'll go shopping and I'll buy a shirt, or a skirt, and I'll look at it six months later and think, &#8216;Who bought that skirt?' \n\n\"And it'll be something that I might have bought when I was Sara, for sure,\" Fox revealed.\n\nShe revealed that there are many similarities between her and Sara - and that the two \"absolutely\" rub off each other.\n\n\"I really like Sara, so that's been really good. If you're going to play the same character for 10 years, it helps so much if you actually like the character, or if you have small things in common. \n\n\"I hope that little things of her have rubbed off on me. She's very brave, she's much smarter than I am, more serious and more focused.\n\n\"Sometimes I just go to work, and I put on the jacket and I feel like I'm her. I've never experienced that as an actor before - it being so seamless and easy to become someone else.\"\n\nSo, has she been keeping up with the crime lab shenanigans? \n\n\"For a little while I followed the show until William Petersen's character (Gil Grissom) left. I knew he was leaving and I wanted to see how that played out.\n\n\"After that I actually forced myself not to watch, because I thought that if I were to really take a break from the show, I shouldn't be watching it. So I got very behind,\" she said, laughing.\n\nAnd as much as she misses Peterson, whom she gets along marvellously with, Fox was excited to return.\n\n\"In some ways, it was like being with old friends that you hadn't seen in a long time, and in other ways it was brand new,\" she said. \n\n\"But I was so slow. Things we had done for years, like putting on gloves and doing scientific experiments - they had to show me how to do the steps all over again.\n\n\"It was like I was the new person making the day take longer. I kept making simple mistakes that I'd never made before. \n\n\"I have a whole other level of admiration and respect for my co-workers, for those tiny skills that they have. Just being able to put on their rubber gloves at the right time so that the rest of the scene goes smoothly is a crazy skill.\"  \n",

        "content": "\nFollowing an early season's worth recent rocky episodes, \"House of Hoarders\" was a pleasant surprise.\n\nAfter weeks of sharks in pools, vampires taking on werewolves, and a gimpy serial killers wearing pleather suits, I was almost certain the show's handling of this psychological ailment of the moment would be serve as nothing but shock value.\n\nBut the writers took time to address the issue as a mystery and a very real problem.\n\nOf course, there were plenty of shocking, and pretty gross moments throughout the hour.\n\nThe house itself was depicted as an unpleasant, debilitating environment, but every reveal and disgusting detail was played toward the episode's mystery. Was the hoarder really a killer? Was the mental disorder being played to hide a more sinister intent?\n\nThere were also some great character interactions, especially between Sara and Nick, as they viewed the case in different ways.\n\nSara had sympathy for Mrs. Santiago, which clashed with Nick's view that this woman's condition was little more than a disguise for psychopathic tendencies. Their views on the matter remained divided even as the bodies found in the house began to mount up.\n\nSuch care seemed to be put into the building of the mystery surrounding the house and the family that lived there, with interesting red herrings tossed out to distract, and such lovely emotional resonance in the performances of Jorja Fox, and guest stars Bertila Damas (Mrs. Santiago) and Ramon De Ocampo (Julian Santiago), but all that work was sort of steam-rolled in a conclusion that wrapped up too quickly.\n\nThe final reveal of the actual killer felt like a brick wall, lacking the surprise I believe the writers intended.\n\nOverall this was a nice change from previous episodes. There seems to be hope that CSI will get back on track, leaving the improbable and impossible plotlines behind for what has always made it a wonderful show with great mysteries, a little bit of gore, and great performances that invoke an emotional connection to the characters.\n\n",

I know that sounds rather \"female,\" and silly of me to want to hold on to some of the Grissom-ness, but I'd bet a lot of people feel the same way. How about you? Do you think Jorja adds to the cast, and that the \"association\" helps?

I thought their love story ended beautifully in the jungle. I don't like the \"happy Sara\" either. It just seems too OOC (out of character) for me. I don't care about the Dr. Jekyll storyline the way I did with the miniature killer, blue-paint killer or the Paul Millander story. Laurence Fishburne seems wasted on the show and not sure of what he is doing. Short of canceling the show, do you see anyway to fix it? Or has it jumped the shark? *--Michelle\n\nMatt Roush: Let's leave the shark aside, OK? What we have with original CSI is a show in its 10th season, experiencing an understandable slump, especially in the wake of losing its lead star. Bringing back Jorja Fox was a reaction to the show having shed too many of its core characters (including Grissom and Warrick) too quickly. And while it may not please the ...shippers,\" I've always liked Sara as part of the ensemble so am happy to see her still around, and she gives us an occasional link to Grissom as well. (The long-distance relationship doesn't make much sense, but then, it's hard to imagine Sara being content just sitting around while Gil lectures at the Sorbonne or whatever.) To CSI's bigger problems, I agree they haven't made Fishburne's character dynamic or compelling--even the stunt where he crossed over to the other CSI shows fell flat (though the ratings were strong)--and the new arc hasn't caught fire. It's possible CSI exhaustion has simply set in; it happened with Law & Order, too, although that show has creatively rebounded in the last year or so. Not sure what CSI can do to refresh things without upsetting the long-time loyalists who have attachments to Catherine, Nick, the lab rats, Brass, Doc Robbins, etc. The show appears to have peaked, and it's not likely to go back to the way it was. So we, like CBS, may just have to settle for a while.\n\n[...]  \n",

Circuses say it would essentially shut down the animal portion of their shows.\n\nRepresentatives from L.A.-based Animal Defenders International and Northern California's Performing Animal Welfare Society, along with critter-friendly celebrities Bob Barker and Jorja Fox, held a press conference in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to introduce the new bill that amends the Animal Welfare Act.\n\n\"It's called the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act, TEAPA for short,\" \"CSI\" star Fox explained earlier in the week. \"It will severely limit the traveling of exotic wildlife.\"\n\nNarrowly aimed at preventing maltreatment of non-domesticated animals in traveling circuses, the bill, among other things, proposes severe restrictions on moving wildlife around the country in restrictive mobile accommodations.\n\nThey claim animals suffer by being denied sufficient space to move around when traveling, and are forced to deal with unnatural groupings, such as incompatible species being kept near each other.\n\nThe bill does not address stationary zoos or other permanently sited animal attractions, animals used in film and television productions, domesticated species such as horses moved for rodeo or racing purposes, or circus horses.\n\nCircus operators, of course, have issues with the proposed legislation.\n\n\"Ringling Bros. as well as other licensed, traveling exhibitors are inspected by federal, state and local authorities,\" said Stephen Payne, vice president of corporate communications for Feld Entertainment, which produces the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. \"This bill doesn't do anything to improve animal care. We're the experts on taking care of our animals; we've been doing it for over 140 years.\"\n\n\"We've looked at the way that the USDA has tried to inspect and license traveling circuses,\" noted ADI President Jan Creamer. \"The license fees that they charge only amount to about 13 percent of the cost of an inspection, so actually the taxpayer is paying for most of the cost of those inspections.\"\n\nWhile Creamer is convinced that the bill will stop traveling wild animal shows in their tracks, Representative Jim Moran (D-Va.), the bill's principal sponsor and chairman of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, suggested that circuses could conceivably avoid federal legislation.\n\n\"Right now, the situation is such that we feel the only way to address it is to restrict the traveling circuses,\" Moran said. \"If the circuses want to show us how the more egregious and unjustifiable conditions can be resolved, we would certainly be amenable to discussing that.\"\n\nPayne countered that Moran rebuffed several earlier offers from Feld, whose corporate headquarters is in the congressman's district, to meet with Ringling representatives who could explain the circus' animal care policies.\n\nCreamer said ADI has helped get similar legislation passed in a number of European and Latin American countries. She also noted that approximately 30 U.S. municipalities have enacted full or partial bans on animal use in circuses.\n\n\"The human-only circuses tend to thrive in places where animal acts have been banned,\" Creamer claimed. \"You get more jobs for people, and all of the workers who look after circus animals on a day-to-day basis also do other jobs.\"\n\n\"That's patently absurd,\" Payne said, noting Ringling has 24/7 animal care and veterinary staffs. \"If we are not able to present this vital part of The Greatest Show on Earth, really, it would have a dramatic economic impact.\"\n\nAccording to Creamer's estimate, some 300 animals in 20 to 25 traveling circuses will benefit if the bill passes.\n\nNot insignificant, but is it enough to satisfy animal rights advocates?\n\n\"If this were the last bill that ever got crafted to protect wild, exotic animals, I would be disappointed,\" Fox said. \"But I think it's a really realistic start.\"  \n",

        "content": "\nI can't believe it, but I think I am starting to actually \"like\" D.B. Russell. Granted, the show's new lead (played by Ted Danson) had a very good supporting story this episode, continuing the trend of the crimes getting more interesting, which is something the show hasn't done for some time.\n\nTwo different scenes took the forefront this week. Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) and Greg (Eric Szmanda) followed a man found dead on the streets, his lungs full of chocolate. The victim appeared to have drowned in a vat of the sweet stuff, and Morgan continued to shine as the team's new recruit. I don't remember the last time any of the CSIs were excited to put their hand into a body to feel inflated lungs, and I feel like the character is bringing some new blood, energy, and spirit to a show that needs it.\n\nOddly enough, the death-by-chocolate case was left somewhat open ended as the fallout of the more prominent story unraveled, but it did serve to give both Morgan and Greg some good screen time. And seriously, only on \"CSI\" can you see a guy drowning in luxury chocolate.\n\nMost of the action centered around one of Sara's (Jorja Fox) old cases coming back into the limelight. A serial killer who abducted, tortured, and killed little girls, before hiding the bodies in cement, had just been freed from jail, only weeks before a body was found with the same MO.\n\nThe only small glimpse of plot progression this week came from a discussion between Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) and Russell about this case, with Catherine warning him of getting too personal with the team and advising him to pull Sara, deeply emotionally attached to the original victims, from working it.\n\nRussell kind of listened, and kind of didn't, but not before Sara's interactions with the original, now free, killer almost cost the department a lawsuit.\n\nI don't want to ruin how things wrapped up (I will say that it was one of the possibilities I called halfway in), but the plot actually worked. It provided one of those \"ah-ha!\" moments that I have always liked about \"CSI,\" and it really came through as the result of a team effort.\n\nA solid case is one thing, but the show is still leaving me grasping for straws. What happened to the thinly veiled threat Russell made about getting rid of Nick (George Eads)? What about Nick and Catherine's fight at the end of the first episode? Will we find out anything anytime soon?\n\nPerhaps not, but while I'm throwing down the prediction gauntlet, I'm going out on a limb and saying that all of Russell's family is dead. Gone-zo. His almost annoying dedication to bringing them up at every crime scene and at every awkward moment just seems too consistent to be accidental. I have a feeling there's more to him than meets the eye.\n\nBut, he is starting to grow on me. In the first episode he already blew past Laurence Fishburne in my mind, and while he will never be able to replace the hole Grissom (William Petersen) left in my heart, he's quirky, interesting, and at least seems to be trying to take the team in a different direction.\n\nAll in all, a very solid episode from a show I was starting to write off. If the case is good, that can oftentimes be enough to carry a whole episode, and this week that's exactly what happened.\n\n",

        "content": "\n(CNN) &#8212; Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains.\n\nAnimal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its \"Operation Lion Ark.\"\n\nThe flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses.\n\nThe 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000-square-foot temporary biosphere, complete with grass, trees and other natural features, at the sanctuary in Keenesburg, about 30 miles northeast of Denver.\n\nThey're sleeping better, are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison, \"which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected,\" said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary.\n\nThe ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker.\n\nBarker and actress Jorja Fox of \"CSI\" described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN's \"Jane Velez-Mitchell.\n\n\"It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly,\" Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses.\n\nOf the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions.\n\nThe sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN.\n\nThey'll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa.\n\nLiving in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter,\" said Fox.\n\nThe 320-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses more than 275 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats.\n\nThe Wild Animal Sanctuary emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary, not for entertainment.\n\n\"It's a home for animals, not a zoo for people,\" Craig said.  \nAnimal rights activists and groups are optimistic that Bolivia's 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos.\n\n\"I'm against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals,\" Barker told HLN.\n\nThe sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit, Craig said. \"We hope they become long-term contributors.\"\n\nAbout 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility, which costs about $2.5 million a year to operate, were in the United States when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations, he added.\n\nMost of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population.\n\nLionesses receive estrogen implants so that they won't go into heat. That reduces the competition and fighting among males.\n\nCraig praised Bolivia for taking action.\n\n\"This is the first country that stepped up,\" he said.\n\nHe expects Peru, Ecuador and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues. Cities and states in the United States are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores, according to Craig.\n\nThe 25 lions are adjusting well, appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing.\n\n\"Like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations, they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening,\" Craig told CNN. \"There is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom, so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present. This will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats, when they can complete their journey.\"  \n",

        "content": "\nBob Barker, the former host of \"The Price Is Right,\" made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses.\n\nAt a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty.\n\n\"How do they train them? They have to dominate the animal,\" Barker said. \"How do they dominate the animal? They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. They shock it with all sorts of electric devices. They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks.\"\n\nBarker, who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection, is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act. The bill, which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act, has attracted bipartisan support.\n\nThe bill would affect only traveling shows. It specifically exempts zoos, aquariums and research labs and rodeos.\n\nRep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans, \"how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation's moral character.\"\n\nDr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most, if not all, lions, tigers and elephants in traveling shows: \"Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed.\"\n\nBut the concerns are not confined to their housing. Jan Creamer, president of ADI, said there is sufficient documented evidence &#8212; gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses &#8212; that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment.  \nBarker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga [sic.] Fox of \"CSI\" and \"The West Wing,\" who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road.\n\n\"Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun. ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd actually be very disappointed in us, for [going] to these places,\" Fox said.\n\nA recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation.\n\nSimilar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and India. And, according to the panel, more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit.\n\n\"It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing,\" Barker said.  \n",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nStory:\n\nWhile attending a scholarship benefit party for the hearing impaired with Gil's mother Betty (Phyllis Frelich), Sara (Jorja Fox) is first on the scene when a car bomb goes off. The man inside is Dr. Eric Lambert (Anthony Natale), a colleague of Prof. Julia Holden (Marlee Matlin), who we later learn is Gil's ex.\n\nAfter learning that Julia, who was at the scene when the car was discovered, lied about her whereabouts at the time of the explosion, Sara puts her in the crosshairs as the prime suspect. Her personal feelings for her husband seem to add to her motivation to pin the crime on Julia. Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) wants her off the case but Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) vouches for her.\n\nThe team begins to investigate several students at the college, including a disgruntled grant candidate, Michael Bowman (Tyrone Giordano) and Julia's T.A., Sean Wyatt (Sean McGowan). It's soon revealed that Julia was having an affair with Sean. A little digging into his background reveals that he's Canadian, not English as he claimed. After Michael unknowingly delivers a bomb to Julia's office, Nick (George Eads) discovers that the package had to have been detonated by a hearing person. Sara and Katherine administer a lie detector test to Sean, which he is told he passed. However the test is actually an \"auditory evoked potential test,\" which reveals that he can indeed hear. The team learns that Sean's brother is actually the interpreter whose been aiding them in their communications with the deaf community. The two brothers hatched the scam to win half a million dollars in grant money. \n\nJulia thanks Sara for snuffing out Sean, who she had fallen in love with against her better judgement. And Mrs. Grissom and Sara talk with Gil (William Petersen) over video chat, seeming to have made some progress in their tenuous relationship.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nWhile \"CSI\" fans may have been excited about the return of William Petersen, it was really Marlee Matlin's guest spot that should have been played up. Matlin's turn as a professor at a school for the hearing impaired, caught up in an illicit affair with a scam artist posing as a student was fascinating to watch. And her shared history with Grissom added a little bit of a spice to what might have been just another day on the job for Sara.\n\nMatlin did a great job of portraying the emotions of professor and prime suspect, Julia Holden. Sign language is a visual form of communication which Matlin uses with great effect. While a hearing actor might raise her voice or change her tone, Matlin gets the same if not better effect, through her evocative use of sign language. It's easy to forget that you're not hearing her voice, her physical acting is so engrossing.\n\nThe introduction of Grissom's mother and Sara's mother-in-law added another layer to Sara and Gil's already complicated relationship. The end scene where the two \"Mrs. Grissom's\" talk to their beloved Gil via video chat was endearing but Petersen's appearance amounted to little more than fan service.\n\nAs for the case of the week, I'll lodge my usual complaint that clues comes too easy for the CSI team. Bomb makers leaving receipts for gun powder sitting around? Who even asks for a receipt when making DIY bombs? \n\nBut the twists and turns of the case weren't really the heart of the episode. It was watching Sara get to know her mother-in-law in the midst of a very touchy murder investigation and getting a closer look into a community most hearing people are not privy to, that made \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms\" one the best episodes of the season so far.\n\nCrave Online Rating: 9 out of 10.\n\n",

The Sara Sidle actress has nothing but high energy and enthusiasm just hours before the season premiere, and could not be more thrilled about the show's twelfth season. CSI Files' Shane Saunders caught up with Fox to talk about her presence on the show this season, working with new cast members, a fellow co-star's pending departure, and much more in this exclusive interview.\n\nCSI Files: First I just want to start with clarifying something. You're back this season but working a reduced amount of episodes like last year, correct?\n\nJorja Fox: Yes.\n\nCSI Files: And how many episodes do you think you will be in this season?\n\nFox: We're talking somewhere between fifteen and seventeen. I did fifteen last year and I did fifteen the year before that. I'm really probably the laziest person in Hollywood so it's a really good schedule for me; it allows me to get some rest [and] I have a couple of very little projects that I've been doting on since I took a sabbatical that I don't want to drop the ball on. So they've been very generous in allowing me the time do that kind of stuff.\n\nCSI Files: I've seen the first two episodes of the season and they're really fantastic. What do you think of the scripts so far?\n\nFox: I think the scripts are spectacular; really spectacular stuff so far. Grosser than ever. You know every time I think that they can't out-gross themselves anymore, they do. Melissa [Byer, Co-Executive Producer] and Treena [Hancock, Co-Executive Producer], watch out for those two. They have two of the darkest minds that I've ever met. [Laughs.] They're really unassuming, sweetâ¦ like you would never in a million years think these two ladies were writing for CSI and writing some of our darkest stuff.\n\nCSI Files: One of my favorite moments of the season so far is Sara teasing Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) about her driving in episode two. The smirk you two exchange is worth a million bucks!\n\nFox: Aww, thank you. Well her character is really great and I think we're gonna see a lot of cool one-liners coming out of Morgan. She's rough in a really humorous way and sexy at the same time. The more I get to know her I'm like, \"you're a lot like your character!\" [Laughs.]\n\nCSI Files: Well Morgan also has a vibe going on that reminds me of a younger Sara.\n\nFox: That would be a compliment! Thank you.\n\nCSI Files: They have a lot in common.\n\nFox: They do have a lot in common. It's really fun to infuse some younger energy into the show. The tricky thing with Morgan is she's really good at what she does. The easiest storyline for her is to go and have all the other characters teach Morgan what to do, and that would probably be the easiest thing to do. But Morgan is coming into CSI Vegas as a seasoned pro and it's just really fun. The exchanges that you see in the next couple episodes, particularly with Eric Szmanda who plays Greg Sanders and Morgan, are priceless. Just off the page I was laughing out loud. One thing that I've learned from all these years is when I read an episode I might think it's good, but it always ends up better once it's shot. I'm looking forward to that.\n\nCSI Files: What's coming up for Sara as the season progresses?\n\nFox: Saraâ¦ she's kind of like a rolling cart right now. I will say there are some exciting love trysts forming this season on the show. Sara's completely clueless about those because she's happily married and very much in love with her husband. I think one of the trickier parts for Sara is quietly making this long-distance relationship work. For me I've been so blessed; I've always had some sort of love interest on the show almost since the beginning. Now I've got this really amazing love interest who is far away, so that's hard. I miss Billy [Petersen, Gil Grissom] and Sara misses Grissom. So she's there primarily so far supporting the other storylines. Sara has a big arc in episode three where she goes head to head with some really nasty characters and that was a lot of fun for me to do.\n\nCSI Files: One of the great things about CSI is how you guys always get great actors, and this year you're getting to work with Ted Danson (DB Russell). How's your experience so far working with him?\n\nFox: You know when he walks on a stage sometimes I swear I see feathers under his jacket. I'm convinced he's an angel. And I'll let you know more about that later in the season. He's spectacular; he's just a great guy. He's really warm; he's an actor's actor. I think it's normal for somebody like me to be nervous to work with Ted Danson and actually, the nerves that I thought were gonna happen never materialized. He really gets down in trenches and wants to rehearse lines and talk character. He really takes all that energy from where you can be nervous because you're with him and pushes it onto the story. Next thing you know you're working and not even thinking about the fact that you're working with Ted Danson. I think that's a very special unique talent for an actor to have; to make all the actors you're working with comfortable. I'm really thrilled.\n\nHonestly, I gotta say that I was absolutely heartbroken when Laurence [Fishburne, Dr Ray Langston] wasn't coming back and it was a surprise to me. I loved working with Laurence and I miss him dearly, but the gift I guess was someone as cool as Ted Danson would show up. I'm really keeping my fingers crossed. I think fans will really enjoy this season.\n\nCSI Files: You were very instrumental in bringing William back for an episode last season, and there's a strong possibility he's coming back to help Marg Helgenberger's exit with Catherine [Willows]. Have you two discussed what might happen with your characters?\n\nFox: Not as of yet. It is something that we generally do to get together and talk about. I think everyone's still really hoping that Marg is going to change her mind. [Laughs.] Everyone's delaying getting prepared for that in the hopes she'll postpone her departure.\n\nCSI Files: Apparently Ted is attempting to talk Marg into staying. Do you think she might stick around a little longer?\n\nFox: I would be a fool to try and project what Marg Helgenberger might do on any given day; she's a force of nature. If she does go I think it's going to be a hundred people sobbing in plain view of each other on the stage when we say goodbye. I really can't imagine doing the show without her, but at the same time because I walked in season eight because I was exhausted, maybe I sort of personally understand that it might be the time where she feels it's time to take a break. I'm trying to support her, but I think once a day when I work with her I ask her to stay. Who knows what she'll do. That's part of the fun right now, too.\n\nCSI Files: Every now and then there's talk about meeting Sara's mother. Is there someone you'd like to see play Laura Sidle?\n\nFox: Gosh, a whole bunch of people come to mind and probably a bunch of them are actually too young to be my mother. Susan Sarandon would be amazing. Mary Tyler Moore would be amazing. Let me think hereâ¦ Kathy Bates would be amazing, but she's pretty busy and has her own show now. That's one other thing that's so great is that there's always something to look forward to. We've been talking about Sara's mother since season four or five and so just knowing that this storyline is out there in the ethers may happen is something to look forward to. I would imagine the intensity of stuff between those two women would be pretty insane in an entertaining way.\n\nCSI Files: You've said in the past how you'd like to write an episode of the show. Is that something you're still chasing after?\n\nFox: Yeah, I'm still advocating for the musical actually. [Laughs.] That may be the episode that I do try to write because I think everyone in the writers' room is definitely opposed to it, which I completely get. [Laughs.] So maybe I think I'll write that episode and present it and then see if they think it's awful. Which they probably will, but it'd be a great exercise for me.\n\nCSI Files: It would make a great lab rats episode!\n\nFox: Yeah, indeed! Oh, I have ideas about this musical and I don't know that I necessarily have great ideas, which is why I'm not a writer or necessarily a director, but a girl can dream.\n\nCSI Files: Is there something in particular that fans should look forward to this season?\n\nFox: Well I think we'll have at least one love affair which is always a lot of fun for us. The world that we live in in Las Vegas is so dark and so unforgiving sometimes and so difficult to sort of process, and I think that a love story could be a really cool thing to come out of that; it'll be very well done. Then there's the issue of Marg; I think that's kind of the really big, big, big question mark. If she does decide to go we probably will develop that idea over several episodes. It will be deep that I know for sure.\n\n",

        "content": "\nAs hard-core fans of CBS' \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" know, former CSI boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen) had deaf parents and therefore is adept at American Sign Language. They also know he married fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and is in the jungle doing research, while Sara is back in Las Vegas working crime scenes.\n\nBut what they probably don't know is that Grissom had another woman in his past, something that Sara discovers in a rather uncomfortable way.\n\nIn the episode \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms,\" scheduled to air on Thursday, Feb. 3, after a murder at Gilbert College, a school for the deaf, Sara is caught between her mother-in-law, Betty Grissom (Phyllis Frelich), a professor at the school, and Julia Holden (Marlee Matlin), another deaf professor who doesn't know Mrs. Grissom just from work.\n\n\"The relationship between me, Julia and Sara is interesting,\" says Matlin, speaking sign language through an interpreter between scenes, \"because there are some surprises that arise during the episode. I know her husband; we had a past; we were intimate.\"\n\nMatlin, an Oscar winner, has an extensive background in both TV and film as well as strong local ties. She grew up in Morton Grove, graduated from Hersey High School in Arlington Heights and attended Harper College in Palatine.\n\nHer \"CSI\" role puts her in conflict with Sara.\n\n\"(Sara) has a lot on her plate, not only about her husband but trying to figure out if I'm the murderer or not,\" Matlin adds. \"She's straddling the fence as to whether she should trust me as a woman who says she didn't do anything wrong, because there's a conflict there.\"\n\nComplicating the situation is Sara's testy relationship with her mother-in-law.\n\n\"Phyllis is an amazing actress,\" says Fox, \"and one of the first things she said to me was, 'I'm sorry. I'm going to be mean to you on the show.'\n\n\"A couple of times, when my character has turned to walk away, there have been looks that could kill. I haven't seen them, but they'll probably make it into the final cut.\"\n\nAdding to Sara's misery is co-worker Nick Stokes (George Eads), who has transferred his admiration for Grissom to his mentor's mother.\n\n\"I invented this whole back story,\" Eads says. \"I'm overtly gracious to Mrs. Grissom when I see her, almost like she's a surrogate mom. Because of the regard he has for Grissom, he thinks the same of the mom.\n\n\"So I'm playing a little bit where I'm Mrs. Grissom's pet, and Sara's kind of the problem child. Nick likes seeing Sara in an awkward and precarious position.\"\n\nWhile Nick may be kissing up more to Mrs. Grissom, Eads may not be working as hard on his communication skills.\n\nWhen it's mentioned that both Eads and Fox were learning ASL for the show, Matlin quips, \"Not so much George.\"\n\nOn the other hand, regarding Fox, Matlin says, \"She's so enthusiastic, and she's so eager to learn more new signs. She seems to be a perfectionist, and she wants to sign how her character would sign. She's not supposed to know sign language skillfully, so what she knows fits her character. It's not like she sees her mother-in-law every day.\"\n\n\"I think I have the proficiency of a clam right now,\" says Fox of her ASL chops. \"I'm hoping to work my way up to squirrel by the time we finish this episode. It's sure something I'd like to continue with.  \n\"Sara has been making an effort to spend time with her mother-in-law, especially because Grissom's not in Vegas. She's been practicing and learning sign language, but we all know that Sara's a workaholic, and maybe she hasn't quite focused on that to the degree that Mrs. Grissom would like.\"  \nEven though Petersen is no longer on the show, the character of Grissom has been kept in everyone's minds, especially in this episode.\n\n\"When we were talking about doing this show,\" Fox says, \"I did call him, because I wanted to make sure that he was comfortable with this.\"\n\nWhile there's no word whether Julia might ever return on \"CSI,\" Matlin has had a good experience.  \n\"This is really one of the best jobs I've ever had,\" she says. \"It's just too short. It's a family here, and I'm entering their territory. But they are so welcoming, with open arms, open hearts, open minds.\"  \n",

The lions are oging into a life that they have never dreamed of.\"  \nThe crates carrying the lions are being transferred to a fleet of waiting animal transport trailers that will take the animals to a lionhouse and 80 acre enclosure at the sanctuary created especially for them.\n\nThe lion area includes a fabric-covered structure with eight fenced-in and sodded enclosures where the Bolivian lions first will live indoors, acclimating themselves to Colorado's weather, while work is finished on four separate 20-acre, open-air habitats that will surround the building.\n\nBarker, former host of \"The Price is Right\" game show and a longtime animal-rights activist, contributed about $150,000 toward the construction of the facility.\n\nThis afternoon Barker said he found it \"mind-boggling\" that ADI had managed to champion legislation making circus animals illegal in Bolivia and then was able to complete such a massive rescue of animals, who range in age from cubs to adults.\n\nBarker said he has donated about $2 million to ADI's work and expects to make another contribution to fund future campaigns.\n\n\"My only hope is that this will open the door to putting circuses out of business, as far as animals are concerned, in other countries,\" Barker said.\n\nFox, a star of the TV drama \"CSI,\" said she joined ADI as an ambassador because the international organization has a \"hands-on, roll up your sleeves, get dirty approach animal rescue work\" that appealed to her.\n\nMany of the animals have lived their lives in cages on the back of lorries. Although the animals still will be captive, Fox noted that they will be roaming on \"99.9 percent more acres\" than some of the animals had ever lived in before.\n\n\"Some of these animals have never set foot on grass,\" she said.\n\nAlexandra Cardenas, global campaigns manager for Lost Angeles-based ADI said the organization now will begin to focus on passing a laws in Peru and Brazil similar to the one in Bolivia.\n\n\"The momentum is in Peru for legislation, and also in Brazil,\" she said. \"That's our focus right now.\"\n\nThe animals spent more than nine hours on the flight, but ADI veterinarian Dr. Mel Richardson, who flew with them, said the lions appeared to have weathered the travel well.\n\nAs the cargo doors on the Transportes Aereos Bolivianos plane were opened, lions roared and Denver Police officers armed with rifles stood toward the back of the gathered crowd.\n\nAs the crated animals were unloaded, they moved in closer.\n\n\"We are just here for protection,\" one officer said, adding that they did not anticipate that any of the animals would escape from the steel crates.\n\n",

Not so, TV Line revealed this week, as Fox has only just been promoted to regular status, coinciding with the start of CSI's twelfth season this fall.\n\nFox, 43, used to be a series regular during the first seven seasons of CSI; however, she left the show at the start of Season 8. There were occasional guest appearances, of course, but even after she came back to the show on a recurring basis in Season 9, Fox opted to remain a special guest star. But no more! When Season 12 premieres in Sept. 21, Fox will be a full-time cast member once again. (Now, if only Grissom would come back, too.)\n\nIt's just the latest in a series of big changes for CSI. Earlier this year, Laurence Fishburne revealed he would be leaving the show, and last week, CBS announced that Ted Danson had been cast as CSI's new shift supervisor.\n\n",

        "content": "\nNow here's a love letter to \"CSI\" devotees: EW has learned exclusively that William Petersen will reprise his role as Gil Grissom with a cameo in an upcoming episode. The actor -- who left the show in January 2009 -- already shot his appearance on the CBS drama and we're told his return involves Jorja Fox, who plays Gil's on-screen wife Sara. It's unclear exactly when he'll appear back in or around the lab, but TV Line teased that it may occur this week.\n\nAs EW first reported in December, the writers paved the way for a possible Petersen return by penning an episode that introduces Gil's long lost mother, played Phyllis Frelich. In the Feb. 3 show, a murder occurs at a school for the deaf where Grissom's mom is a professor. Sara goes to investigate but ends up facing an unexpected challenge â a surprising lack of affection from her mother-in-law. Apparently, Grissom's mom never felt that Sara was the one for her beloved Gil so the two women have a few fences to mend. The episode also stars Oscar winner Marlee Matlin as a school colleague who not only serves as Mrs. Grissom's protege but used to date Gil. Guess who momma Grissom prefers?\n\nFans are supposed to think that Gil is constantly on the move so he and Sara maintain a long-distance relationship. This week's story is a continuation of an arc that started way back in season one's memorable \"Sound of Silence\" episode, in which we first learn that Gil can sign because he grew up with a deaf mother.\n\nWhen Petersen left, both he and his fellow producers promised that the longtime TV and stage actor would return occasionally. Back in 2009 when he was preparing for his departure, Petersen told EW exclusively that while he won't miss playing Gil, he hopes fans won't get too shaken up over his character's absence. \"I think there's a way for the audience to remember him, like losing a great co-worker they've known for years,\" Petersen said. \"He didn't die in a plane crash, he didn't get a brain tumor. He's out there.\"  \n",

[...]\n\n[...]\n\nThe return of Jorja for as Sara Sidle hasn't really upped the energy level. (If anything, the shoe has suffered a bit by loosing another woman &#8212; Liz Vassey as the sparky \"lab rat\" Wendy Simms.)\n\nNow in its 11th season, CSI still airs good hours, and coexecutive producers Treena Hancock and Melissa R. Byer are talented writers who authored two of this season's better episodes, November's \"Wild Life\" and Feb. 3's \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms,\" which treated us to a fleeting glimpse of Gil Grissom via a video-chat conversation with Sara. Even tucked away on a screen-within-a-screen, Petersen exuded the kind of energy and bristling curiosity that CSI too frequently lacks these days.  \n",

        "content": " Melinda Clarke's Lady Heather, one of the most cultishly beloved guest characters on CSI, returned to the series this week. Unfortunately, her appearance only reminded viewers how much dramatic tension this show has lost.\n\nLady Heather is now a sex therapist -- professional name: Dr. Heather Kessler â and she was visited by Laurence Fishburne's Ray Langston and Jorja Fox's Sara for background on a kinky case they were investigating about a dead girl who had acted out her neuroses as a kitty cat. (Animal role-playing as a therapy tool â doesn't everybody do that, or am I the only one who visits his therapist dressed as a turtle?)\n\nThe dialogue was what I believe they call in the biz a bit too on the nose: \"Cat got your tongue?\" Sara asked a pervy suspect. A bit later, Ray said of the dead woman's struggle to live, \"Iona didn't want to be a cat forever.\"\n\nFrom her very first appearance, the Lady Heather character was treacherous for an actress, so easily capable of sliding away into ridiculous campiness. But tonight, Clarke, as always, managed to keep firm command of her role; she plays it with a ripe wisdom. Lady Heather's early encounters with William Petersen's Grissom crackled with the give-and-take of two intellects intrigued by the unusual â it was intellectual eroticism.\n\nUnfortunately, this week, Sara and Ray's exchanges with Heather were flat. What could have been amusing -- Sara and Heather eyeing each other as mutual admirers of the great Gil-man -- was empty glowering; Sara sounded like Jerry Seinfeld sourly greeting his least favorite postal worker (\"Oh, hello, Newman\").\n\nThe final scene was all the more dismaying for the memories we have of old Lady Heather/Grissom tet-a-tets.

A prohibition on the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses is proportionate, responsible, the least expensive solution to this problem, and long overdue.\n\nWe call on Congress to bring to an end, once and for all, the abuse and suffering that has been exposed by ADI time and time again.\"\n\nSimilar bills have been passed in other countries and it seems strong that this bill will pass in the US.\n\nWay to go!  \n",

        "content": " \n\nCSI *fans got a real treat this season when former series-regular *William Petersen* returned for a brief cameo. The mastermind behind that story, 2008 Genesis Award Winner *Christopher Barbour, graciously took a break from his busy schedule this afternoon to speak to me exclusively on how they got Grissom back, Catherine's future, and a big showdown between Nate Haskell and Ray Langston. **Spoilers a plenty after the jump!\n\n&#8212;-\n\nSaunders: Some pretty major events happened in your last episode \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms.\" With the show eleven seasons into its run, what made the writers decide to do an episode with a heavy focus on Grissom (William Petersen), even though he is no longer a series-regular?\n\nBarbour: (laughs) Yes, indeed. We love Jorja Fox and Sara. And obviously, Sara being married to Grissom, there was a need to address how that relationship works in some way, shape, or form. We are a procedural show so it's more difficult to sort of delve deeply into the lives of the characters. You usually get suggestions and snippets of that. In the beginning, the episode was more focused on Sara and her relationships. I was actually surprised that we were able to get Billy to come back and do the cameo; I was thrilled.\n\nI feel very fortunate. I'm not just a writer on the show, but I was always a fan of the show. So it was sort of a dream job. Billy's a fine actor and I can understand wanting to move on to other projects, I think Jorja really reached out to him. She had done that for him in \"Leave Out All The Rest,\" and he asked her &#8216;do you mind doing this one video segment?' and she said &#8216;sure!'. So she reached out to him and it was really a surprise. I guess in the back of my mind and probably Treena Hancock and Melissa Byer&#8216;s mind that we might have an opening if Billy didn't mind making a phone call or being on Skype. In my mind I didn't think it was going to happen.\n\nWe wanted it to be a surprise to the audience. People go &#8216;oh, why didn't you promote it?'. I guess from my point of view I like the idea that it might've been something that was a surprise. It sends a signal that you should watch the show because you never know what you're going to see. I also didn't want people to think that we were jerking them around because he's not in a lot of it. I didn't want people to be disappointed. Hopefully you get a sense of how they stay in contact while in a long-distance relationship.\n\nSaunders: Was it scripted from the beginning to have him return?\n\nBarbour: No, not at all. Not at all. We thought about meeting the mother-in-law because of the concept of returning to the deaf school. The possibility of having Marlee Matlin as a guest-star. That all sort of gestated together, and then the possibility of having Billy coming was late in that process. There was a possibility of doing the episode without him; I think it's so much better with him. It's very hard to talk around him, and we were very fortunate that he agreed to do the show. It might have felt a little empty if we had done that episode, met his mother, seen the relationship between mother-in-law and Sara, yet not see Grissom. (laughsspan style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" /span)\n\nSaunders: How hard was it to get him back?\n\nBarbour: (laughs) Honestly, I don't think it was that hard. I know that Jorja had reached out to him. I don't know how hard in the sense in that he has moved on to other things- it was really more of a scheduling question. I think in regards to him making guest appearances the door has always been open.\n\nI think he was more than happy to accommodate it, which I thought was very nice.\n\nSaunders: From a technical standpoint how difficult was it to incorporate the sign language into the script?\n\nBarbour: It's interesting in that regard. We wanted people to really feel that world as much as we can get them into that world. From my point of view I like the twists and turns of an episode, but I didn't like the idea of hiding the bad guy as the translator because he was someone that would be present for us and necessary for us in order to communicate.\n\nWe were interested in the notion that there were different types of sign language; I don't think people really think about that. We had some people around to help us make it authentic, and then certainly having Marlee Matlin along was very helpful.\n\nSaunders: A few weeks back we got a sense that Langston (Laurence Fishburne) might be going to the &#8216;dark side.' (Barbour laughs) He's clearly having a rough time with serial killer Nate Haskell (Bill Irwin), and from what I can tell he's reached his breaking point. At what point is he finally going to snap?\n\nBarbour: Well, we will be bringing Nate back. He is not done tormenting Langston yet. That is what we're working on as I speak, without giving anything away. Bill Irwin is an actor we're really excited to have as a part of the show and he will be returning. Hopefully, it will be a satisfying run as we approach the end of the season.\n\nSaunders: Fun times for Langston-\n\n*Barbour: *(laughs)\n\nSaunders: There's been some interesting discussion on the Internet that Ray's ex-wife Gloria (Tracee Ellis Ross) could somehow end up in the Langston/Haskell showdown. Care to comment on that?\n\nBarbour: I would say that that is a possibility. (laughs) We're exploring the possibility of what would Haskell do to antagonize Langston.\n\nSaunders: Is Tracee contracted for future episodes?\n\nBarbour: I don't know that for a fact. But we are exploring–I think we'd like her to come back.\n\nSaunders: One of the things I read was that Haskell might pull a Kevin Spacey moment from *SE7EN *and delivers Gloria's head in a box to Langston-\n\nBarbour: (laughs) The CBS-approved not-too-grotesque version. (laughs) We have had decapitated heads on the show before. (laughs) Perhaps. Without trying to give anything away, I think it's just about Haskell upsetting him and with the potential for Langston to become very dangerous.\n\nSaunders: Marg Helgenberger (who plays current CSI supervisor Catherine Willows) had made it clear that she plans on leaving after this season. Has an exit-storyline been put into place?\n\nBarbour: We are segueing her off and I think we're still developing how that might happen. And also the possibility that we leave the door open should she decide to stay.\n\nNot only do we love Marg, but the character Catherine Willows is very important. And to leave the door open for the possibility of her to be back is and when she leaves. Not all of the things have certainly been settled yet. When those things are settled we would want to develop a storyline to usher her off the show in a style that she deserves.\n\nI have to say just speaking as a fan she is always going to be an important part of the show. And like Grissom, she'll still be referenced as it seems like she's going off to bigger and better things.\n\nSaunders: What are the chances Catherine will stay in a successful relationship with Vartann (Alex Carter)?\n\nBarbour: I don't know. Well, tune in tonight! There will be an interesting development in tonight's episode (\"The List,\" written by Richard Catalani). I think that's one of things we're dealing with as the weeks and months proceed; what kind of relationship she wants to have and what the future is for her. What other possibilities are there for her and with someone like Vartann.\n\nSaunders: Melinda Clarke and Louise Lombard are returning as Lady Heather and Sofia Curtis, respectively. What are the chances they'll stick around long-term to help add a little more female blood to the cast?\n\nBarbour: As far as Lady Heather I think the door, again, is left open for her. We found a storyline that was appropriate to bring her back; she is a favorite of ours. With Sofia, I think there's a possibility to return again- even before the end of the season. But that hasn't been settled.\n\nSaunders: Will Sofia be coming back as the deputy-chief of Las Vegas or another town?\n\nBarbour: In Las Vegas.\n\nSaunders: Do you happen to have a favorite character to write for? Your two episodes so far this season, \"House of Hoarders\" and \"The Two Mrs Grissoms,\" happen to have lots of Sara involvement. And I have to say, you do a fantastic job writing her character.\n\nBarbour: Thank you. I don't know if I necessarily have a favorite character to write for. I'm a fan of all the characters and like the family component of the show. In \"House of Hoarders,\" I liked how I could focus how each one contributes to the whole and each one's response to a certain thing.\n\nThere is something that I'm drawn to Sara about her past and her working through those issues. And in \"Hoarders\" Nick (George Eads) and Sara's response to that environment was something that I was interested in exploring. I like how they're CSIs and this group of people who interact given certain circumstances, and work together to solve these problems.\n\n(Barbour notes here that when he reads the blogs, he discovers fans who aren't necessarily in favor of team conflict. He says it's nice to see a team work together through their problems.)\n\nSaunders: That kind of segue ways into my next question: If Sara sticks around full-time next season, is there a chance we'll get a little more backstory involving Sara's mother?\n\nBarbour: There's always that possibility. I hope so. For our show we like doing a mystery every week and to find the right cases that will illuminate our characters is always a challenge. I think you will see more of that [backstory]. I am not at purview as to who is coming and going, I just know that we are all close from actors to writers to crew. We all love working with each other which is really great. If Jorja should stay, we'll definitely try to explore that backstory.\n\n*Saunders: *Finally, as the show reaches the home stretch of season 11, what can viewers expect to see during the remainder of this season's 22 episode order?\n\nBarbour: There definitely will be a big showdown between Nate Haskell and Ray Langston and the team. That will hopefully be exciting and surprising for everyone and everyone will be surprised at the outcome of that.\n\nSaunders: Is Anthony Zuiker (the creator of CSI) planning on bringing Sqweegel back?\n\nBarbour: That is true. We may be revisiting Sqweegel.\n\n",

Marlee is a genius, I was so jealous watching her work. Because it was a deaf themed episode (The Two Mrs. Grissoms) we had tons of deaf actors, including Phyllis Frelich, who won the Tony for the same role, Marlee won the Oscar (Sarah in \"Children of a Lesser God\", Phyllis on Broadway and Marlee in the film). They were both very friendly and just stunning to watch work. The entire CSI cast and crew were very welcoming and very professional. They've been doing it so long that they run like a well-oiled machine, and everyone gets along, which is important in a creative environment. Jorja herself was an absolute sweetheart. She had to learn sign language for that episode, and she was working extremely hard to make sure she got it right. I hope I get to work with her again. \n\nIn CSI you played a very interesting role who finally turns being the killer, it was your first time performing a villain, do you feel comfortable doing that character or do you prefer the hero or a leading role?  \n  \nI've played the villain before, and it's by far my favorite role. I find them far more interesting to play and really fun - when else can you be the bad guy and have no consequences?\n\n[...]\n\n",

The vexing vixen â played by Nikita's Melinda Clarke â is back for two reasons: to solve a strange crime, and to provide insider knowledge on that \"evil\" DNA gene that Langston (Laurence Fishburne) shares with MIA murderer Nate Haskell (returning guest star Bill Irwin).\n\nOf course, we already knew that Haskell's season-ending reappearance is right around the corner, but here's the twist: It's Clarke's sixth CSI guest spot that actually kick-starts this intense, killer arc.\n\nFormer team leader Grissom's sexually charged lady friend â who now goes by \"Dr. Kessler\" and is the proud recipient of a Ph.D. -- shows up to help Sara and the Vegas CSIs solve an unusual case involving \"human pets\" (a real thing!). But as Jorja Fox puts it, \"Lady Heather manages to get Langston â who she hadn't previously met -- under her thumb in four words or less. She hooks into him, seeing him as a new someone she can take on.\"\n\nAnd make no mistake, Sara knows all too well of this woman's specific wiles.\n\nIndeed, there are methods (and ulterior motives) to Lady Heather's madness. \"She is very educated on Langston's history with Nate Haskell,\" Clarke tells TVLine. \"She knows he's struggling with this 'warrior' gene and sees that something in him is absolutely boiling underneath. So, Lady Heather offers her help, unsolicited -- but he's not very receiving of it.\"\n\nFollowing Lady Heather's one-episode appearance, Fox reveals that the Nate Haskell arc \"is rising, and it's going to be scary\" when the elusive killer turns up... again. Says the actress, \"We're going to get really into [Langston's struggle] in the next couple of episodes.\"\n\nOh, and if you're hoping that a Grissom-based catfight will breakout between Sara and Lady H, brace yourselves. \"You might feel a little bit of cattiness,\" Clarke teases with a laugh, though Fox promises that's the extent of it. \"I could never say that Sara likes Lady Heather,\" says the CSI vet, \"but there's a level of respect there.\"\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "\nThe packet of photos of Japan seemed to take everyone by surprise. On each page of the packet were two photos: The top snapshot showed a scene snapped immediately after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of March 11. The bottom photo of the exact same area taken three months later showed that the debris had been almost completely cleared away, leaving everything looking â for all intents and purposes â normal.\n\nThat Japan is making remarkable progress in its recovery was exactly the message that His Excellency Ichiro Fujisaki, Japanese ambassador to the United States, wished to impart to the guests attending \"Disaster in Japan,\" a private briefing held on June 16 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe ambassador had been invited to speak at the event by the Artists and Athletes Alliance â a nonprofit, educational and charitable organization that serves as a nexus between the entertainment community and policymakers in Washington, D.C., and with whom UCLA is an educational partner.\n\n\"We're coming back, so please do have confidence in Japan,\" Fujisaki told the audience, which included such celebrities as actors Masi Oka, Jorja Fox and Keith David, former NFL star Nick Lowery and Japanese rock star Yoshiki, as well as members of the Japanese Consulate of Los Angeles and UCLA faculty, friends and administrators. \"Of course, there are nuclear reactor issues, but it's [in] a certain region. It's not all of Japan that is affected. There are aftershocks, but that's calming down as well.\n\n\"So we don't want people around the world to think that Japan is dangerous: 'Let's postpone our trip for the next three years, five years,' \" he continued. \"No, we are already back in that sense, as you can see from these pictures. Please go to Japan!\"\n\n[...]\n\nActress Jorja Fox, well-known for her role on \"CSI,\" is on the board of the Artists and Athletes Alliance. She said that Fujisaki's appearance was a testament to Japan's persistence, hard work and bravery. \"My heart goes out to the people of Japan and everything they've been through. We can't even conceive it. In Los Angeles, we're incredibly vulnerable to the set of circumstances that happened in Japan â¦ to earthquakes, to a nuclear meltdown, to a tsunami, under the right conditions,\" she said.\n\n\"So a lot of thoughts and prayers are going out in that direction. I'm grateful that the Japanese people are setting such a high example for the rest of us in times of trouble and strife. I feel pretty certain that Japan was probably the most prepared of anybody to actually receive the [disaster]. And just in an esoteric sort of way, I'm grateful. Japan took a hit for the entire world.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation fans breathed a sign of relief when Jorja Fox returned this season as criminologist Sara Sidle. More gregarious than her on-screen character, the veg actress applies her equally sharp mind and big heart in real life to activism on behalf of animals. She's an executive producer of the upcoming documentary How I Became an Elephant, which follows a 14-year-old girl on her mission to save the planet's gentle giants.\n\nQ How do you account for your activism?\n\n*A* It's a way I can honor my grandmother. She had this amazingly progressive philosophy regarding animals. I remember watching Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom as a little kid, and they're talking about habitat issues and she's saying to me, \"We have to do something about this.\" I guess I'm a kindred spirit.\n\nQ You played Sara Sidle for eight years before taking a break from *CSI*. How has she evolved?\n\n*A* She's still incredibly empathetic, but she's able to be that way and not have it tear her apart. People who are activist, first responders and crime scene investigators see troubling things. You can't really ever get rid of a memory, so a lot of people burn out. It was so cool that Sara would rise from the ashes.\n\nQ How do you avoid feeling overwhelmed as an activist?\n\n*A* I think a lot of those in the field will tell you it's the little daily victories that make it all doable. My dog passed away in January [2011], my beloved Ali. It was really hard. But in June I adopted a rescue dog. For me that's an example of a small victory. Yes, there's pain and sorrow, but out of it, this beautiful animal gets a second shot. Because somebody cared enough to be running around south Texas looking for strays, getting right in there and being in that difficult world, I have this amazing new creature in my life.  \n",

Grissom appeared only at the end of the episode (the scene is above) to chat with his wife, Sara (Jorja Fox) and mom (guest star Phyllis Frelich), via video conference. He wasn't directly involved in the case of the week, which concerned a murder at the college for the deaf where Gil's mom teaches &#8212; although Sara's investigation stirred up a lot of Gil-related feelings &#8212; and he didn't interact with any of his other former co-workers.\n\n(Petersen's cameo also didn't boost the show's ratings. The episode averaged 13.8 million viewers and a 3.0 rating among adults 18-49, pretty much in line with its same-day average for this season.)\n\nThe scene did, however, highlight the oddly touching chemistry between Petersen and Fox. Their characters are not the most socially adept, but together they make a rather nice couple. Here's hoping that the \"CSI\" team can persuade Petersen to do a bigger guest spot somewhere down the road.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nThere's a fine line to ride when doing interviews with folks from the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation franchise. Obviously, I am a huge fan of the shows (otherwise I would not be here), so there’s always a bit of excitement and nostalgia when doing promotional material. But there’s always a reminder in the back of my head that CSI Files is a very professional outlet, and I have to be somewhat on guard as to how ‘geeky’ I get. However, this week’s interview subject is someone I consider to be a vital and important part to the CSI franchise and her knowledge and history from the early days of CSI is so enlightening and special. CSI: Miami producer Corey Miller first introduced me to Elizabeth Devine in 2006, and we had scheduled an interview that never quite worked out (on my end). We reconnected a few years ago much to my delight and I feel like professionally, from a career standpoint, she has changed the direction of the path I take for the better. Devine, who is one of the nicest people you will ever meet, started out at a real-life CSI before segueing into an entirely different career: a writer at CSI. More often than not I find myself increasingly frustrated by how impatient I can be by my pursuits to engage in a television career as well, but Devine gives one hope that, no matter what the job is now, engaging in other professional endeavors is likely to happen. \n\nHere below the consulting producer previews the final episode of 2012, Sara's unhappiness in her life, and looks back on the history of two CSI classics. \n\nCSI Files: Having been on set for some of \"Risky Business Class,\" I get the feeling that the Grissom/Sara pot is being stirred a little bit. \n\nElizabeth Devine: Yes. \n\nCSI Files: With Doug Wilson (Josh Randall) entering the picture does it seem on first blush that he is a threat to their marriage? \n\nDevine: We're not playing it as that right now, but it's more of a realization that she's not getting what she needs out of the relationship with Grissom [William Petersen] being so far away. This is a person that she had a relationship before coming to the crime lab in Vegas and it went well, and we don't know why they didn't pursue it but some probably think it's because she moved to Vegas to work at the Las Vegas Crime Lab. He comes back in the picture and she sees that she can be attracted to somebody and deserves to have someone to be around. Grissom's not there and she's very lonely. I think it's pretty obvious in her expressions that this has been a hard time apart for her. \n\nCSI Files: I have a feeling that this is not the way Sara (Jorja Fox) had envisioned her marriage to go. \n\nDevine: Right. There's no question that she loves him, it's not about that; it's how they're apart so much that I think whenever she hears about being married, I think she feels so separate from him that it's got to be impacting the way she feels about their relationship. \n\nCSI Files: Doug comes from San Francisco and Sara's whole history and back-story originates from that city. Is Sara's mother mentioned in this episode, or any of her back-story at all? \n\nDevine: No, we don't talk about that at all. We really just mention that she worked an assist for the NTSB when she was in San Francisco. They had a plane crash there and that's how she met him. They worked together and became close. That's about as much detail as you're going to get from Sara, but their body language is pretty obvious that they had a relationship. He does try to pursue it a bit in the episode. \n\nCSI Files: And how does Sara react to that? \n\nDevine: She obviously says no. [Laughs.] But I think you can see that she's torn in the fact that not him specifically, but just she's very lonely and she's sad; it's wearing on her. They're playing phone-tag, which we start the episode with, and it's hard for her. She doesn't get to talk to him when she wants to and they have to squeeze time in to talk to each other. They make quick flights to see each other but it's not a consistent situation and she's not happy. \n\nCSI Files: You've been involved with CSI since the beginning, so you most certainly know Grissom and Sara to a T. From your own point of view, what would your ideal situation for this couple be? \n\nDevine: Well if I had my way, we'd have him have a fear of losing her and get him back, but that's not going to happen. [Laughs.] We love Grissom and everybody loves Grissom; it's impossible not to. But is he a good husband? I think he does the best he can. I think their separation is easier on him than it is for her, I'll just say that. I don't think it has to do with how they feel about each other, I really want to stress that. I think it's more it's hard to maintain a long-distance relationship and retain the intimacy that you need when you're married to somebody. She's finding that to be difficult and he must too. We're very sensitive about Grissom. We want to protect that character because everyone loves him, but we also have Sara here and she is the character that we see, so we also feel that we have to protect her as well. It's very hard to figure out what to do because this character is basically talking on the phone to her husband and that's all we see. In a perfect world we'd get Billy back, have him shoot some scenes, and we'd all be happy. But we don't know if that's going to happen. Right now we're playing that it's wearing on them and there will be developments from that. \n\nCSI Files: Donna Hoppe (Pamela Reed) also makes a return. Her involvement here is more with Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois). What can you tease about their connection? \n\nDevine: We know that Morgan has been establishing a closer relationship with her father [Conrad Ecklie, Marc Vann] after really being estranged from him for so long. Now that she's in Vegas, and especially after him being shot, they have become closer and it's a perfect opportunity to play with the genealogy a bit. She is looking into Ecklie's history because she's been a Brody, and now she wants to learn a little more about the Ecklies. That's how we get into the Donna Hoppe story, but she's also close with Doc Robbins [Robert David Hall]. Doc Robbins expressed a lot of excitement about everything Donna and her group were able to do in \"Genetic Disorder\" for him, so he suggested to her that it might be a great way to connect with that side of her family. Donna also helps us solve this case. \n\nCSI Files: How does \"Risky Business Class\" compare to Season One's \"Unfriendly Skies\"? \n\nDevine: They're completely different. \n\nCSI Files: How was it reuniting with Mark Moses? \n\nDevine: It was great. I was so so new when he was on the show in Season One [\"Sex, Lies, And Larvae\"], it was early for me in terms of working on a set, so I was a little intimidated by actors. He is such a nice man and I'm a huge fan of his work on Mad Men and Desperate Housewives. I enjoyed having him in the episode. \n\nCSI Files: You're working more on development in the coming months, but are you going to be writing an additional episode this season? \n\nDevine: I do not know. It could be, but maybe not. We have a big staff and we have some new kids we want to give opportunities to. I'm happy to just jump in and help out and hopefully share some of my experience and help them make a great episode. A lot of this job is helping them mentor people coming up and we have some great young writers. \n\nCSI Files: Now that this particular actress is free you know what storyline I'd like you to revisit? \n\nDevine: What? \n\nCSI Files: \"Organ Grinder.\"Devine: Aaaaah!CSI Files: Since Marcia Cross isn't doing anything, I think that would make for a great sequel. \n\nDevine: That was right before she hit big with Desperate Housewives. I remember Carol [Mendelsohn], of course, was involved with writing the great Melrose Place episode where the shock and awe of when she took that wig off and you saw those scars… do you remember that? \n\nCSI Files: I haven't seen it, no. \n\nDevine: Oh my God! Anyone that watched Melrose Place it was just shocking. So Carol was involved with that and it had a great deal to do with Marcia Cross being cast in \"Organ Grinder.\" That would be fun. I would have to watch the episode again to remind myself how we left that. I think she went to jail, did she? \n\nCSI Files: No! Remember Sara got really peeved by them getting away, and Grissom reminded her that there's no statute of limitations on murder. \n\nDevine: That's right! I love her. I would love to have her back. \n\nCSI Files: I was also watching \"The Accused Is Entitled\" is still a classic to this day. \n\nDevine: Yeah, I really wanted to do that episode. It's such a big thing for cops in Vegas and California, so that was kind of a fun thing to explore where all these cops come to Vegas for a race, someone dies, and all our suspects could be cops.",

        "content": "\nAnyone who knows Jorja Fox&nbsp;understands just how special of a woman she is. The Sara Sidle actress is not only amazingly humble, talented, and yes, beautiful, but she\"s also incredibly&nbsp;brilliant, kind, and well spoken, which makes anyone in her presence feel special. After playing this one character for over twelve seasons, she knows the ins and outs of her character to a T, and is always eager to add new layers and nuances to her performance. Fortunately, for fans, this season will be a year of personal development for many of the characters on CSI, which will allow Fox to crank out some of those dramatic performances she\"s known for. Which is the case tonight with the new episode 'Code Blue Plate Special,' an installment that really hits close to home for Sara. Shane Saunders&nbsp;caught up with the actress earlier this week to discuss character growth, upcoming episodes, and yes, the state of GSR. Spoilers after the jump.\n\nCSI Files: As I watched 'Karma to Burn' I really thought back to the beginning of the series, and really up until a few seasons ago, how Sara was at times moody, insubordinate, and slightly immature, but now she\"s this completely new woman who, to me, seems to have taken over, in a professional sense, the \"Mother Hen\" role from Catherine. There\"s been this huge journey and evolution of the character, that, at least in my mind, seems to have taken this huge shift after she returned in Season Ten, announcing that she married Grissom. Would you say that\"s one of the reasons as well?\n\nJorja Fox: [Laughs.] Oooooh. Marriage? Well, yeah, I think she\"s aged, obviously, like everyone has and hopefully people get a little more mature as they age. I think that she needed to leave not just Vegas, but she had to leave that whole profession behind to just kind of really find her center and her balance. I think as a kid, having the experience she had with her mom and growing up in foster care, I think she had a drive that brought her to the field that she was in in kind of a blind, personal and passionate way. When she quit it and just left, started traveling around the world--and eventually Grissom [William Petersen] joined her--I think she found the love for what she was doing from a whole different place. She buried some ghosts and buried some demons, and was able to come back at it. And, yes, absolutely I think being in a secure and loving relationship with Grissom--I hope very much it\"s helped her stability in that way. Although, I think, reading&nbsp;in between&nbsp;the lines, it\"s really been awhile since we\"ve seen Grissom so I\"ve gotta imagine there\"s got to be a little bit of tension there. But I wouldn\"t know what it is yet because I\"m not one of the writers.\n\nCSI Files: I would imagine after playing this character for over a decade, portraying her in this new light gives you as an actress some fun things to do.\n\nFox: Oh, yeah, and I think we\"ve talked about this before, but to come into Season Thirteen--really forget about of the same show, but of the same character--is something I thought I\"d never experience in my life. If someone had asked me about it when I was younger, I could never have even conceived playing a character that long; it probably would have scared me and might have been something I wouldn\"t think would be fun. But I can\"t believe after thirteen seasons, like, I\"m not bored at all; I\"m still like, \"Wow, what\"s going to happen this year? Who are the people that Sara\"s going to meet this year?\"\n\nIt\"s really exciting to have three new cast members kind of in one season. I could have thought that would be sort of disruptive and might shake the cast up in a way that--because we\"ve always been so close and a really tight that cast that has always gotten along so well--to sort of three wild cards in there you\"d think, \"Wowâ¦ this can\"t go well. It\"s just a question of how badly this is going to go.\" And it\"s been fantastic; I can\"t even believe that we\"ve been able to ride that wave and it\"s just been so fun to have these people to work with, people that are amazingly cool and just incredibly kind and generous as actors and human beings. Of course I still miss Marg [Helgenberger, Catherine Willows], Billy and Gary [Dourdan, Warrick Brown] all the time.\n\nWe just finished Episode Seven and we meet Warrick\"s son, who we haven\"t seen since the funeral [in \"For Warrick\"], and his ex-wife. It was a really difficult and devastating episode to shoot. I know I miss him and I really wish we would have never killed him off--I feel like I really disagreed with The Powers That Be with that call. It was really hard to go back and shoot, but I really think it\"s going to be a beautiful show.\n\nCSI Files: One of the big takeaways for me from last season was the dynamic of DB and Sara. Those two really hit it off, and I think they can relate in a way that, for example, they both have so much going on in their lives and have to work this grueling and taxing job, and put it all on the back-burner. And from what I read most fans feel that way, as well. What have you enjoyed most about working with Ted Danson?\n\nFox: He\"s really amazing; I\"m not sure he\"s human. People know him for ten minutes, but he\"s the kind of guy that can show up and create chemistry with someone. You could look into his eyes in a scene and feel like you\"ve known each other ten years. Most people that work with him probably feel that way. [Laughs.] He has that amazing talent to make everyone feel special and on top of that he\"s just an incredible leader. No matter how long a day yet, he\"s still got his energy and his optimism. He\"s incredibly funny and it\"s really nice to stay around at work--some of the days can be pretty gruesome and horrible--and just kind of laugh. I\"m glad they\"ve been able to put a little bit of that into the show; I think the show will never be a comedy, but we\"ve been able to do more funny stuff in this last season than probably in all the years of the show combined.\n\nCSI Files: From what I can gather, you\"ll be doing a reduced number of episodes this season. Are we looking at doing more or less episodes than last season?\n\nFox: That is not always totally in form; it doesn\"t really take shape until we get through the season. I know that I\"ll do a minimum of fifteen, so probably somewhere between fifteen and seventeen. We sort of take a couple months at a time.\n\nCSI Files: You took a break seasons eight and nine. Is your plan as of now to see the show to the end?\n\nFox: [Laughs.] I can\"t answer that, Shane! Only because we always think, \"Aaah, it\"s probably only one more season. Maybe two more seasons.\" I sort of think we got to be coming close to the end, but who knows, right? Hopefully we can go another ten years. Yes, right now, theoretically, I think I\"d like to see it to the end; that would be a really cool thing to accomplish. My goal as of now is to do twenty seasons in a row on primetime network television and this, for me, I\"m starting season seventeen.\n\nCSI Files: Oh wow.\n\nFox: Yeah. Some of those seasons I may have done only four or five shows, but I was in there; I snuck my face in there. [Laughs.]\n\nCSI Files: 'Code Blue Plate Special,' is a rather significant installment for Sara. How personal of a case is this to her?\n\nFox: Pretty personal. I think it\"s going to be a really great episode; I haven\"t seen it. [Laughs.] I totally expected it to be on last Wednesday--I was like, 'Where are all the shows?' I enjoyed watching the debates but didn\"t realize how much they would preempt everything. Not only does Sara know the victim, but she believes she knows the suspect. It\"s pretty personal, I think. It\"s certainly something that Sara is incredibly passionate about. You\"re going to see Sara get very angry.\n\nCSI Files: We\"ve seen her look into cases of those she\"s known in the past; how emotionally invested is she in this case, as to say from 'One Hit Wonder,' when her friend Melissa Winters goes from victim to suspect?\n\nFox: [Laughs.] Oh, wow. That\"sâ¦ thank you for mentioning that episode. [Laughs.] This is a person that Sara sees several times a week in her life. She knows the intricacies of this woman\"s life and the suspect? She hates this guy. She hates him. He\"s a really talented guy and he\"s that guy I think where everyone wants to see him go down. I don\"t know that Wednesday night\"s episode is going to get 100% resolved.\n\nCSI Files: Episode Eight is in production right now. What else is going on for Sara in the first run of episodes?\n\nFox: I have a really intense arc on Episode Seven which is the episode we bring Warrick\"s son in. I think that episode, particularly for Nick [George Eads] and Sara, is pretty devastating and heart-wrenching. Almost every character so far this season--at least the six forensic investigators--have had a chance to really delve very deeply into a case or situation. Eric\"s [Szmanda, Greg Sanders] character has an episode that deals a lot with old Vegas and Vegas in the forties. Elisabeth Harnois [Morgan Brody] has a case that deals with human trafficking that we really follow her for most of the episode. Elisabeth Shue [Julie Finlay] in 'CSI On Fire' is about to do that; that\"s a cold case of hers that will also bring in her ex-husband. I think we\"ve all been there supporting each other for a lot of these episodes, but there\"s definitely one that is driving each episode. Russell\"s son [Brandon W. Jones] is accused of murder. There\"s been a real theme of personal intimacy this season. I don\"t know--you tell me if you like them and if the fans like them.\n\nCSI Files: Ted\"s son on the show, Brandon, is a really good friend of mine and he was pretty excited about having a pretty big episode to work with.\n\nFox: He was amazing; he did a great job. He\"s been a great addition to the cast. Of course he\"s not there every week, but he\"s got such a great sense of energy and great spirit. It\"s great to get to know him a little bit.\n\nCSI Files: There\"s always the rumor mill circulating at the beginning of a season when producers mention in interviews that they\"d like to see Billy return, and that they enjoy the two of you having a creative input in the story-telling of GSR. Have you had any meetings thus far? I know Billy stepped away from Hurt People, so is it looking more likely for him to make a cameo this year?\n\nFox: I didn\"t know he stepped away from Hurt People. He did?\n\nCSI Files: About a month or so ago.\n\nFox: I miss some of these important moments. Well, certainly if he steps away from Hurt People then yes, I\"d say there is a good chance than there might have been a month ago. I think a month or two ago it appeared like he might have been a bit too busy for us, so that\"s exciting. I wish I had more to say about that, but it\"s definitely promising now.\n\nCSI Files: Over the summer you launched an official Facebook page, but haven\"t really used it all too much so far. Are you sticking with Facebook for the most part, or are you thinking about attempting Twitter as well?\n\nFox: Oh my gosh, well thank you for even seeing my Facebook. You see how neglected it is then you know that my obvious answer is I definitely can\"t add another social media forum to my list. If I can\"t even update--I thought to myself, 'All you have to do is post twice a week! It\"s fun and creative and whatever it\"s going to beâ¦' and weeks go by where I can\"t even post anything. I\"m an embarrassment to the online social media community, so yeah, no Twitter. [Laughs.] I still haven\"t given up on Facebook. I apologize, and thank you for even caring.\n\nCSI Files: This weekend you\"re receiving two awards: one from ADI and another for your film, How I Became An Elephant. How does it feel to be recognized for your ongoing support of animal rights?\n\nFox: It feels amazing, but I don\"t really feel like I earned it yet. I don\"t know that I\"ve really put the time and the energy into getting awards of any kind, but obviously to be recognized is an amazing feeling. I\"m going to have a very busy weekend and I\"m really excited to celebrate those parts of my life.\n\nCSI Files: One last question just for fun. Your schedule is incredibly busy, but what shows are you watching during your downtime?\n\nFox: I love Modern Family. I usually wait a couple weeks to watch them on my Tivo or try to watch a couple in a row. I\"ve been watching Homeland; I love Homeland. [David] Rambo\"s new show, Revolution, I\"m watching. I love some of the NatGeo sort of reality programming--Locked Up Abroad. And I\"m excited about the premiere of American Horror Story.\n\n",

Brass has a really nice moment where he talks about how he actually hasn\"t been to the cemetery since Warrick\"s funeral, but he has his own ways of remembering him. Brass likes to think about how much energy Warrick had. He says a little piece about Fight Nights, those are the nights that he thinks of Warrick. He has a feeling that there\"s no way he would be missing all of that electric energy on the Strip. So they each have their own ways of remembering him, but I think Nick and Sara are the two who the weight is most apparent on their shoulders as they\"re dealing with this case.\n\nCSI Files: I was watching the pilot the other day for what seems like the 700th time. From the onset, Brass and Warrick had a very tumultuous relationship.\n\nMularz: Brass and Warrick had an adversarial relationship at the start, and so did Sara and Warrick at the very start. Sara kind of blames Warrick\"s gambling for Holly Gribbs\" incident, and she is skeptical of him until a little ways into that season when there\"s a misunderstanding about whether Warrick was leaving on duty again to go gamble, and it turns out he was actually going to pick up money to help out this boy he was helping support, so they grew much closer. At the start of the show, both of those relationships, Brass and Warrick and Sara and Warrick, were pretty rocky.\n\n[...]  \n",

This year, without giving too much away, we\"re going to start dealing with the fact that long-distance relationships are hard. I don\"t know if you\"ve ever been in a long-distance relationship, but my wife and I were apart for a while and there\"s a lot of message leaving. So it starts with Sara leaving a message and kind of beginning in the sense that long-distance relationships have challenges.\n\n\"'CSI Files:\"' Since it\"s hard to know what Billy\"s involvement will be, is it easier having Grissom off and about than having the character in Vegas, or is it simply a story and creative decision?\n\n\"'Pokaski:\"' I can\"t speak for everyone else, but I prefer having him abroad because it allows you to focus 100% on Sara and Jorja Fox who is another actress I\"m just enamored with. It makes it easier to just look at her and not have to make up those weird stories like, 'Oh you just missed him!' or 'We had breakfast today.'

That particular storyline will gain traction in this season\"s tenth episode, 'Risky Business Class,' which is scheduled to air December 12. Ed star Josh Randall will appear (in what is being eyed as a recurring role) as a NTSB investigator that Sara previously worked with in San Francisco, the city she was employed in prior to joining Grissom\"s (William Petersen) team in 'Cool Change.' Randall\"s Doug Wilson character comes at a time where Sara and Grissom\"s marriage is going through a difficult and straining time, and mere seconds after the couple try yet again to connect on the phone. 'We have big plans for Sara,' another source shares. 'The audience is going to be very interested in a turn that she takes.' Though not able to elaborate on what direction the character will be taking, CSI Files has learned exclusively that Adam J. Harrington, who played Ronald Basderic in this season\"s 'Code Blue Plate Special,' will return and quite possibly reignite some of Sara\"s anger and frustration seen earlier this year. 'That\"s going to be an interesting adventure.'\n\n[...]\n\nTo fill the rest of the season out: an episode that has some Latin music flavor, an odd forensics murder mystery at an all-female poker tournament that has a unique murder weapon, and maybe another visit or two from some of CSI\"s iconic characters from the past. 'There\"s a possibility of a Lady Heather [Melinda Clarke] and Sofia Curtis [Louise Lombard], but the writers have stories they\"re working on and it all depends on a case and story basis.'\n\n",

If anyone is going to stop [Nick] from loosing focus, it\"s her; and she did. Will they talk about this issue in subsequent episodes?\n\nBarbour: Yes. There was purpose to the fact that they\"re in different places in their lives and yet it was very poignant for Sara and Nick to get into it. She does want to help him--there\"s the emotionalÂ push-backÂ of him quitting at the worst possible time; there\"s never a good timeÂ toÂ do these things, there\"s always emotions so it\"s messy. They can help each other, but like Nick said he\"s not in a position to be lectured to, but that isn\"t what she was trying to do. There was a little bit of miscommunication and they will try to help each other out. Sara has gained perspective so she understands where Nick is coming from and Nick is not at a point where he can easily hear that at this moment, at least in the premiere.\n\nCSI Files: Moving forward in the season, how will the dynamic of Nick, Sara and Greg Â shift? Is this a season of conflict for the three of them?\n\nBarbour: I think it\"s probably more a season of maturity for Greg. An episode coming up will focus in on him and his further maturing at CSI and his personal life. I don\"t think there\"ll be conflict with them, but certainly things are changing in their lives. Things can never stay the same; you get comfortable with a certain situation, and you expect certain things and sometimes things change for good and sometimes they change for bad.

The PSA is only 90 seconds long but the impact of the video is strong. The scenes flip from free roaming wild elephants in Africa to a traveling circus elephant named Krissy that is chained, beaten, and broken for the entertainment of humans.\n\nFox appears in the PSA holding a bullhook with a very solemn expression on her face. She says, 'This is a bullhook. It\"s sharp, it\"s heavy, and it hurts. This is the weapon of choice for elephant circus performers. It is used to get elephants to perform tricks to amuse people.'\n\nKrissy was captured at the age of two and ended up in America working in traveling circuses and fairs. ADI discovered Krissy and another elephant being beaten with bullhooks, golf clubs and electric shock waves while undercover for an investigation into circuses in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFox has been fighting for the rights of elephants in entertainment for quite some time. She produced a film that explores the treatment of elephants that will be screened this weekend in Florida and Hollywood. The film is called 'How I became an Elephant' and follows a 14-year-old girl\"s life-altering journey to South East Asia which led to a rescue plan to save a species.\n\nThe CSI star joined Bob Barker last November to the launch of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act (H.R. 3359). According to Chron, 'The Act would outlaw the use of animals like elephants in traveling shows and fairs where they are forced to live in traveling accommodations.'\n\nFox ends the PSA by saying, 'These mighty, magical creatures exemplify all that is wrong with traveling circus: The confinement; the deprivation; the social isolation; please support the work of ADI and stop circus suffering.

Was that planting the seeds for some trouble in Sara and Gil's relationship or at least the hint of trouble? Could this former colleague try to make a move since there's still chemistry there and Sara has to point out that she still has Gil, even if they're not living together at the moment?\n\nMeanwhile, is this \"CSI\" case an act of terrorism or is it specific to who was on the jet? With it being an executive jet, we wouldn't be surprised if it was the latterâand perhaps caused by someone who has a history with whoever was on board. Will the CSIs come across something that points in the direction of terrorism until perhaps the end of the episode? With even the possibility of this being an act of terror, they have to tread very carefully; if it was, there could be another attempted attack coming.\n\n[...]  \n",

Recently, Jorja spoke about the premiere of new episodes and one of the major complaints: the lack of Gil Grissom. William Petersen will briefly return to the show via Skype and talk to his wife and mother. \n\nIn the episode \"The Two Mrs. Grissom\" Sara Sidle uses sign language. Was it challenging for you? \n\nAt first, I panicked. I thought I would have to learn sign language for a scene and suddenly became half of the episode. The writers of &#8216;CSI' give the best of themselves and go for broke. \n\nDid you enjoy learning sign language? \n\nIt was fun and ended up buying several videos of sign language. I have not yet had time to get to them, but I want to do in the offseason. It is a language that makes sense to me. \n\nHow has having William Petersen back in the series? \n\nIt was incredibly exciting and we did what we could to keep everything with the utmost secrecy. William decided he wanted to surprise the audience. If by chance you were watching the show, saw it, otherwise they would have to find him. It was an impossible task for us. \n\nWhy did Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom used Skype to communicate? \n\nThere was an episode where Grissom Sara sent a video message by email, essentially to break with him from Shepard sea, off the coast of Galapagos Islands. We believed that this was the appropriate way Grissom and Sara had to report regularly. After that, he was in a jungle in Costa Rica, which is great. \n\nWas it fun doing the episode \"House of Hoarders\"?\n\nGeorge Eads had been talking about the idea of hoarders for two years, so it was very exciting to see the script when it came to light. The writers ran with it and became something bigger than George had imagined. I was very happy to oblige. \n\nWhat effect did the episode \"House of Hoarders\" in the cast? \n\nI think George went home and ran saying it was a whole ciberacaparador. In my house, I'm very minimalist, but when I looked at my computer, my mails and texts that I save, I thought \"I'm hogging, only instead of at home on my computer\". If I could download everything I have on the computer, it may fill six houses. \n\nWhy is the episode \"Fracked\" so important for everyone? \n\nHumans are sharing increasingly smaller amounts of space and we have to invade areas who had been in the wild.'re being forced to pull resources from places that should have remained untouched forever. There is a long list of issues that are reaching critical mass. Hopefully everyone will enjoy it because I think all , almost anywhere, can take it to a personal level. \n\nHow has the character of Lady Heather developed in the eleventh season?\n\nHer character has had the opportunity to be involved in many mysteries. offers a different side of herself in this episode that fans have not seen before and they will decide whether the new Lady Heather is authentic or not. has been very chameleon. has been able to do different things to different people.\n\nDo you have a favorite episode of season 11? \n\nOne of them is undoubtedly \"House of Hoarders\". It was very deep, felt like I was going through a maze and suddenly I found myself in the middle and have to work to find the way back home. \"The Two Mrs. Grissom\" was great too, was something that normally is not usually done. \n\nWhat you have told the followers of the series on the eleventh season? \n\nEverything I've heard about Grissom's return. It was incredible to see him again this season. The fans thanked him again and I hope this little glimpse have thought about how wonderful his life outside of Las Vegas. \n\nWould you still like to play Sara Sidle? \n\nI still have not spent a single minute playing Sara boring. Your life is fascinating and interesting. Changes and dangerous, but somehow always has a way out of the difficulties. If you keep calling me to play Sara, I will come.\n\n",

        "content": "\nCSI actress Jorja Fox released a new video message about circus animal abuse today on behalf of Animal Defenders International (ADI)\n\nLos Angeles, CA (PRWEB) April 19, 2012\n\nActress Jorja Fox (who plays CSI\"s Sarah Sidle) released a new video message about circus animal abuse today, on behalf of Animal Defenders International (ADI). Fox is seen holding a bullhook, a weapon used to control elephants saying, 'This is a bullhook it\"s heavy, it\"s sharp, and it hurts,' she continues, 'This is the weapon of choice for elephant circus performers. It is used to get elephants to perform tricks to amuse people.'\n\nThe 90-second PSA tells the story of one elephant, Krissy, who was captured from the wild in Africa in 1984 at the age of two and eventually ended up in America where she is hired out by Texas based Trunks and Humps to work in traveling circuses and give rides at fairs.\n\nAn ADI undercover field officer filmed a Texas based circus elephant trainer savagely beating Krissy and another elephant with bullhooks and golf club and even electric shocking the elephants. At one point she is dragged to her knees and kicked in the face by the trainer, who continues to work with elephants. The video also shows Krissy kept on chains and in a transporter when not giving rides at fairs. The brutal scenes are juxtaposed with breathtaking images of a family of wild elephants living free in Africa. (1)\n\nJorja says, 'I wanted to help this campaign because I believe elephants are like stardust, something magical. Intelligent, gentle giants whose life revolves around family, love, affection and companionship.' She concludes, 'These mighty, magical creatures exemplify all that is wrong with traveling circus: The confinement; the deprivation; the social isolation; the barren environment; and the violence.'\n\nIn November, Jorja Fox joined Bob Barker, Congressman Jim Moran and the ADI team for the launch of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act (H.R. 3359) in Congress. The Act would outlaw the use of animals like elephants in traveling shows and at fairs where they are forced to live in traveling accommodation.\n\nFox says, 'It is time for people to realize these circus and elephant rides at fairs are not harmless fun. These are living animals whose lives have been destroyed. I urge people to get in touch with their Member of Congress and ask them to help end this suffering.'\n\nThe CSI star\"s crusade to end the suffering of elephants in entertainment also includes screenings this weekend of &#8216;How I became an Elephant' at the Sarasota Film Festival in Florida and the First Glance Film Festival in Hollywood. The film, produced by Fox, explores the treatment of elephants through the eyes of a 14 year old girl.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nIt was a pleasure sitting down with Jorja Fox on a park bench on a quiet Wall Street in Kingston on Labor Day to interview her about the new documentary she produced called \"How I Became an Elephant.\" The documentary was one of the films screened in the first Kingston NY Film Festival. \n\nJorja Fox is a vegetarian so I wanted to know where she dined. Which Hudson Valley restaurants offer good vegetarian cuisine? Does she visit the Hudson Valley often? \n\n\"Wow! A gazillion places to eat which is so nice while you\"re on vacation. I never had a car when I lived in NYC so this area is mostly a mystery to me. I came to the first Woodstock reunion, back in the 1990s so I knew I was in the general area, but I couldn\"t tell you exactly where I was (laughs) I just got on the bus at Port Authority. Because of Astrid, we had a mutual friend in California, who invited me to come. For very strict vegetarian there is the Garden CafÃ© in Woodstock which is amazing,\" says Jorja Fox.\n\nJorja Fox enjoyed eating at two Kingston restaurants. \"At Boitson's, I had these incredible vegan fried mushrooms, like oyster mushrooms, almost taste like calamari, and we also enjoyed DUO Bistro very much,\" adds Fox.\n\n\"How I Became an Elephant\" tells the real sad and disturbing tale about the behind the scene story that most circus-goers and Thailand elephant trekking tourists don't know. Elephants are my favorite animals, and I knew about illegal poaching, but I had no idea about the torture these poor mammals go through at the hands of the mamouts-elephant trainers. Baby elephants are ripped away from their moms and \"broken\" and repeatedly hit with and beaten in order to perform tricks for the tourist dollar. Many of the scenes of the abuse are hard to watch. (In fact, the young woman sitting next to me sobbed for half the movie!) I don't think I could ever go to a circus after seeing this movie now. Instead I would like to one day visit an elephant sanctuary in the US. Fox mentioned that there are only two right now, one in Tennesse and one in California. I will put those on my bucket list.\n\nAs a kid, Jorja Fox watched National Geographic every week with her progressive, environmentalist and wild life lover grandmother, never missing a show. When Jorja Fox met filmmaker Tim Gorski at a small dinner party in LA, they started talking about his work in Thailand with illegal wildlife trafficking, and she found a way to get invested with one of her passions, and later became the producer for \"How I Became an Elephant\" which stars a 15-year old animal activist Juliette West.\n\n\"I adore elephants for so many different reasons-their gentleness, intelligence. They are vegetarians. Like all of the really large land mammals, their habitats are in some of the most peril. They are a great subject because what\"s going on with them is so criticial, so immediate. Elephants just have a grace and dignity to them,\" says Fox.\n\nFox said she had a lovely weekend in the Kingston/Woodstock area and was very excited to be part of the Kingston Film Festival, especially since it was the first screening of the film in her home state of NY, and also because she got to hang out with family while she was here.\n\nAlthough the documentary will appeal to animal lovers of all ages, Jorja Fox and Tim Gorski agree that their target demographic is junior high school to college age viewers since the movie's lead is 15-year old Juliette West. Besides a couple of distribution deals on the horizon, they also plan a Netflix release, and hope to have screenings at high schools and colleges.

For example, they played Queen\"s 'We will rock you', and the crowd got into it, dancing and waving their hands. Meanwhile, the crew and cast would walk around and record video of everyone. On another one of these breaks, Jorja Fox did an impressive little dance in a little hidden space behind video village. When she came out for the next take, I said to her, 'I caught your little dance. You got some moves, I was very impressed.' For the record, I thought she was quite good. 'You should do a musical. In fact, you should do a musical version of CSI, where everyone sings and dances.' Now I have to admit, I have always found Jorja Fox to be likeable on screen. Even back on West Wing, where she played a Secret Service agent, I wanted to see more of her and hoped that her storyline would get extended. And it turns out in real life, she\"s actually exactly that -- very warm and friendly. When I met her at base camp, she immediately introduced herself in a very welcoming way, and when we took the van to set, she was like, 'Have you met everyone?' She played a bit of a host, even though she had, of course, no obligation to do so. So when I brought up the musical, she didn\"t even blink, she said, 'Oh totally, and I have this great idea for it.' And she went on to describe how all the music and dancing could happen in one of the CSI character\"s dreams. And then she said, 'I\"ve been pitching this, you gotta help me sell it to the producers.' So later, I walked up to one of the producers, mentioned my conversation with Jorja, and the musical CSI Las Vegas idea. He sorted grunted, nodded, and walked off. Hmmâ¦ guess that went over well.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nWritten in conjunction with PopCulturePassionistas.com.\n\nJorja Fox, best know for her roles on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation along with The West Wing and ER, is also an avid environmentalist and conservationist. She is being honored this weekend with the Animal Champion Award for her work with Animal Defenders International. ADI has worked tirelessly to rescue and protect the abused and neglected animals across the globe.\n\nThe event this weekend, called the Lion Ark Night will focus on the rescue mission performed last year where ADI uncovered and put an end to cruelty to circus animals in Bolivia. They went undercover to rescue 29 lions and airlifted them from South America to Denver. Price is Right *former host Bob Barker funded the entire thing and he, too, will be honored this weekend with ADI\"s Lifetime Achievement Award. The entire rescue is being made into a documentary called *Lion Ark and clips will be shown at this weekend\"s Hollywood Hills gala.\n\nIn a recent exclusive interview, we spoke with Jorja about her work with ADI. We asked her about the event and she replied, 'It\"s going to be a heck of a partyâ¦ Bob Barker\"s going to be there. You can\"t beat that. I try never to miss a good party.'\n\nJorja talked about working with Bob, 'He\"s a legend. He\"s the nicest man. He\"s funny. He\"s got great style. Every time I see him I\"m wondering what he\"s going to be wearing. Maybe single handedly, more than anybody else that I know of, has been quietly contributing to causes that are very close to my heart and been contributing in extraordinary ways. Bob travels less than he used. He gets out in front of the public less than he used. And he\"s been making up for that behind the scenes. He has given incredibly generous gifts to several organizations over the last couple of years that have really allowed the organizations to stay afloat.'\n\nWhile she fully supports the award being bestowed on Barker this weekend, she is less than enthusiastic about her own honor. She stated, 'It feels really undeserved. I feel I have a lot more to do, a lot more to accomplish.\n\nBut it seems to us that like Jorja has done plenty. She remarked, 'Every time they call me, they call me for something extremely exciting.' Aside form her involvement in the Lion Ark project, she has produced a documentary called How I Became an Elephant. It is the tale of a girl who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant working in the entertainment industry. Jorja cautioned that this is not an isolated problem, but a global one. She pointed out that many animals in captivity are forced to live on concrete, which can kill them. She said countless elephants die in zoos due to of infection in their feet because they weren\"t designed to stand on concrete. She noted, 'That\"s a crime. I think these animals deserve a lot better than that.'\n\nJorja also went to Capital Hill with ADI last year to launch the 'Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act.' And she encourages all animal lovers to call or write their congressperson to support the bill which will protect animals in entertainment who travel and from state to state. She stated that they need a federal law to protect them because they fall through the cracks since each state\"s laws vary.\n\nShe also emphasized the importance that the work of the ADI has not just for the animals but for humans as well. 'We can\"t exist without wildlife. We\"re just completely kidding ourselves if we think we can go it alone without all these animals. And so looking after these animals is important to me for the sake of these animals but also for the sake of &nbsp;people and the future of this planet. I don\"t want to live on Mars.'\n\nOne of her goals is to eradicate certain animal institutions. 'If I had my way, circuses and zoos would be a thing of the past in the way that we know them now. I think there\"s a place for those institutions in the future. But I don\"t think they\"d look anything like what they look like right now.'\n\nSo we asked what they would look like in her version of the future. And while she acknowledged some habitats that already look like her dream there are many more that don\"t. 'I\"d like to see us moving under this umbrella term of \"sanctuary,\" so a tremendous amount of more space, no breeding programs. The public being able to see them would still happen but it would be more removed. People would be in a more respectful, quieter space.'\n\nAnd to Jorja the perfect circus is one without animals like Cirque du Soleil. She stated, 'We have so much to learn from these animals. We haven\"t even begun to figure out what we can learn from them. But I know it\"s not about watching an elephant put a basketball in a hoop. I think we can do better than that.'\n\nTickets for Lion Ark Night 2012 on Saturday, October 13 are $150 and VIP tickets are $500 (which includes a VIP champagne reception). [...] Jorja\"s movie How I Became an Elephant is being screened in the Los Angeles area this weekend. [...] And if you\"re in the New York area this fall, Jorja is producing a one woman show about Dusty Springfield. [...]  \n",

If he hadn\"t had herâ¦\"'\n\nA corrupt officer of the LAPD appears to be working closely with the kidnappers. He leads CSI-investigator Finn (Elisabeth Shue) to where D.B. Russell\"s (Ted Danson) granddaughter Katie is being held. The girl is allowed to call her grandfather to show she is still alive. The head of the laboratory gets very angry: who targets his family, targets him. The kidnappers demand a ransom of two million dollar. In the meantime, Nick Stokes starts drinking because he wants to quit and deputy sheriff Conrad Ecklie is in the hospital. He was shot in the season finale of the last season of the still popular crime show. Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) finds evidence at the crime scene, Russell\"s house that can possibly lead them to the kidnappers.\n\n\"'Calmness and wisdom\"'\n\nSara is starting to take Catherine Willows, the former right hand of the boss of the nightshift, place on CSI: a \"mother hen\" with experience who radiates calmness and wisdom. As of 2011,Jorja Fox is playing the role again on a weekly basis, after a break of a few seasons. \"Sara has become more mature and wiser,\" admits the 43-year-old actress. \"She had to get away for a while, to regain her balance after a few shocking cases. During that time she buried some demons from her past, so she could start over with a clean slate.\" Her marriage to Gil Grissom is also something that has been good for Sara: \"Because of that she has become a lot more stable. I do have to admit that they haven\"t seen each other for a long time. This could mean that there is some tension between Sara and Gil. But what exactly is going on, I don\"t know. I\"m not on the writers team.\"\n\n\"'Season 13\"'\n\nAbout the thirteenth season of CSI, which starts tonight on RTL 4, we can say that Sara and het colleagues will be personally involved with the cases. The son of CSI Warrick Brown, who was murdered four years ago, comes back into the picture, which brings back some painful memories. After the discovery of a mass grave, Finn gets to deal with an unsolved case from het past and het ex-husband. And D.B. Russel will again be having a hard time, when his son Brandon gets accused of murder.  \n",

Many fans have wondered why there isn't more mention of Grissom or why Sara doesn't seem to acknowledge that she\"s even hitched.\n\nI do have a couple of questions, though: \n\n\\# How long ago was she in San Francisco to work with Wilson? Their conversation gave clear indication it had been several years, but if it was before she came to Las Vegas that would be more than 13 years ago. Talk about carrying a flame for someone for a long time.  \n\\# The preview teased \"An old lover of Sara's.\" Did anyone get the feeling they had been lovers?!? I sensed an attraction, but not that sort of vibe. Then again, Jorja Fox can be a bit tough to read, so maybe the crooked smile meant lover. \n\nEither way, I hope we get more of Sara and her relationship; I would like to see it go somewhere. It just seems like a boat anchor around her neck; she can\"t date because she married to a ghost, she can\"t hold bidirectional conversations because William Petersen isn't really on the show, we only get one side if she talks to him at all. \n\nIt\"s just frustrating watching the character float in limbo!\n\nOn the other hand, you can tell it's December as Donna Hoppe (Pamela Reed) made a return visit approximately one year after her last visit.\n\nI\"m not sure if they are trying Reed out to see if she would work as a series regular or frequent visitor, but she was great. She fills in a gap in research and knowledge that helped when she was here before and she certainly helped this week. \n\nOverall I\"m giving the episode 4.2 family trees for a fun return of Reed and a much needed revisit to the Grissom family line. I hope everyone has a safe and happy holidays and we will see you all back here with the return of CSI in January.  \n",

How come we never actually saw the crash site? That kind of threw me a little. It might have even done the episode a disservice, as not seeing the scope of the crash meant that we never formed a visceral attachment to the victims, so it was harder to get into the story of their deaths.\n\nSeeing Doug definitely threw Sara for a loop, but while she ignored a call from Grissom, she never crossed any lines. Even the hug she gave Doug before he left town was less about wanting to connect him with him and more about just wanting to hold someone since she couldn\"t hold her husband. He brought up some great memories for her, but Sara is not a cheater, and had things gone any further, I probably wouldn\"t be writing these reviews anymore.\n\nIt begs the question, thoughâ¦how is this story going to end?

The \"Cape-Fear-ish\" storyline, says executive producer Don McGill, was designed to take the ever-serene D.B. and see \"what would happen if we took that guy who seemed to have everything in control, his family and work, and really pushed him to the edge.\"\n\nThat push will carry through the season. \"We show his worst fears, that his granddaughter is dead, and we see his demons and his darker side, his impulse to go an eye for an eye,\" McGill says. \"As we lean forward into the season, we'll see that worst fear play out. Once something happens to a family &#8212; even if the resolution seems neat and tidy &#8212; the emotional fallout is anything but.\"\n\nThey'll also explore the relationship between him and Shue's Finn. \"They have a long history,\" albeit a mostly professional one, McGill says. While D.B. is committed to his family, \"for Finley, who struggles to have relationships with men, Russell is kind of the perfect man &#8212; but unattainable, which is part of the attraction.\"\n\nWho's new or returning: McGill says they'll focus on the core cast this season &#8212; including, finally, answering the perplexing question: What's up with Sara (Jorja Fox) and Grissom (the long-departed William Petersen)? He's been in the jungle for years, but she's still on the case &#8212; are they even married anymore? \"We'll answer that, in a way that may surprise people.\" McGill says. \"We'll deal with her dissatisfaction with the long-distance relationship, and may find a resolution as to where the marriage is headed.\" The season also will explore the relationship of Ecklie to his estranged CSI daughter Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) &#8212; and his romance with Hodges' mom Olivia (guest Jaclyn Smith). &#8212; Bruce Schwartz\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\n'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"s' season finale proved that even though the procedural drama has been on the air for 12 seasons, it\"s still got what it takes to surprise viewers. The kidnapping of D.B. Russell\"s (\"'Ted Danson\"') granddaughter Kaitlyn (\"'Mia Hayes\"') and the resignation of Nick Stokes (\"'George Eads\"') set such dramatic â and unforeseen â events in motion that the audience will be compelled to tune in for 13th season premiere to get answers.\n\n[...]\n\nWill Sara Sidle [Jorja Fox] be more in the forefront this year? Since Fox returned to the series on a fulltime basis last season â after four seasons as a guest star, she hasn\"t had a front burner storyline. Part of the reasons is time had to be spent to introduce the new characters of DB Russell and Julie Finlay [Elisabeth Shue]. But that is about to change.\n\n'Sara will very much be in the forefront in the premiere and she is very much in the forefront in episode 2,' Mendelsohn says. 'There will be a murder at the cop diner, where the cops and the CSIs all go to eat. Actually more than one murder. It is going to hit home and hit a friend of hers.'\n\n'Also in terms of Sara, we may delve into the Sara/Grissom [William Petersen] long-distance relationship. We are always hopeful that Billy may come back.'\n\n[Ed. Note: Petersen was supposed to have made his return to TV this year with a Cinemax series, \"Hurt People,\" but the latest word is he has pulled out of that, so he may be available.]\n\n[...]\n\n'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' premieres its 13th season on Wednesday, Sept. 26 at 10/9c on CBS.\n\n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox is best known for her role as Dr. Maggie Doyle in the television medical drama ER. Since then, Fox has had many successful appearances in television shows including The West Wing and most recently CSI: Crime Scene Investigation playing Sara Sidle. Fox talks about her career, how CSI changed her life, and what fans could expect this season.\n\nQ: What does it feel like to reflect on your career and know that you have been on some of the biggest shows in history like _ER_\n\nFox: Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. I started on ER in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. People had to actually turn on the TV at the right time a lot of the bigger shows people wanted to watch live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. I hadnt watched ER and it was my moms favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor and that I wasnt a good actorits just crazy.\n\nQ: So after *ER* you did a ton of television shows and then you land *CSI,* which again is another huge show. Where was your mind set when you heard you got the role of Sara?\n\nFox: That was also a big surprise. I really didnt think that CSI was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was really different and something that I hadnt really read about oftenbut I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do and I was so wrong about that. I thought I would do CSI, have some fun and be back on The West Wing by Christmas. I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later.\n\nQ: How has Sara changed from Season one to Season thirteen?\n\nFox: I think in someways she really hasnt changed that much [laughs]. When we met Sara in 2000 I think she was very much a product of her past and her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be apart of CSI that stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7 and was gone most of season 8 she had a time to wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself. Here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of how I have been playing the character.\n\nQ: What can fans look forward to this season?\n\nFox: I think so far we are in the middle of episode 7. I think we have an amazing season opening up and some great guest stars like oh you know what I dont know if I could say. We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff  I think the writers this year again suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper. We start the season with a funeral and its not really until we get to the end of the episode that we find out why we are all there and whose funeral it is, who has passed. Its a very compelling and suspenseful episode.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nThis season has put focus on Jorja Fox&#8216;s Sara Sidle. Despite returning to the lab in Season Ten's \"[[Family Affair]]\" after a relatively brief exit and marrying her former crime lab supervisor Gil Grissom (William Petersen), the long-distance arrangement for her marriage has taken a toll. \"We are moving toward some understanding of where Sara is and where the strains are within the relationship,\" a source close to the show tells CSI Files. \"It won't mean that Grissom will appear in the near future; it really is from Sara's side at this point,\" one source continues. Though nothing is in the cards for Grissom to appear this season, the status of the marriage will be addressed. \"Those issues are going to come to a head, and we will see that in \"Forget Me Not.\" We will see how that strain has played out, and someone from Sara's past takes advantage of that strain.\"\n\nSo far in Season Thirteen Sara has faced off against a creepy stalker and reunited with a former flame, both of which have served as foreshadowing for upcoming events. In this week's installment titled \"Forget Me Not,\" Sara is accused of murder and once again crosses paths with Adam Harrington‘s Ronald Basderic. \"In \"[[Code Blue Plate Special]]\" we really responded to the actor and to the character,\" another source continues. This go around, however, things become personal. \"Basderic has had survelliance on Sara, and he knows how vulnerable she is,\" they preview of Basderic's return. \"[Co-Executive Producer] Andrew Dettmann thought that would be an interesting way to come back and integrate the pressures on Sara; it would just come to a head with this person because he felt humiliated by her and had taken that obsession too far.\" During CSI&#8216;s run Sara has had her fair share of formidable foes &#8212; from the miniature killer to Hannah West &#8212; so what exactly makes the villains in Las Vegas target the CSI? \"She gets under people's skin,\" a source answers. \"Certain cases, as has always been true, Sara has been able to act very professionally but can at times with certain crimes or certain suspects, affect her. It's interesting that that's happened over the course of the show.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for Sara this week is the introduction of Sara's oft-mentioned mother Laura Sidle, played by Kay Lenz. When \"The Two Mrs. Grissoms\" was penned two seasons ago, the writers felt they were reaching a point where introducing the pivotal family member would make logical sense. \"But in terms of bringing her back for this particular episode, it was about bringing everything to a head in one episode,\" a source reveals. Viewers have been privy to some details on Sara's mother, dating as far back as Season Three's \"One Hit Wonder.\" Laura, a schizophrenic, killed Sara's father and was institutionalized, leaving Sara to be placed into foster care. \"We don't get into too much detail about how that was adjudicated, but she's not in prison,\" going on to say \"she's in a position now where she does care. We see how it's worked for Sara recently.\" The happy-go-lucky reunion is short-lived, at least for now. \"Basderic has communicated with Sara's mother; that's the reason she knows what's happening with Sara. Sara is trying to compartmentalize that part of her life, and Basderic has told her what has happened to Sara.\" Appearing in only two scenes in the episode, the writers were able to \"start filling in the blanks,\" however not completely. \"We may see her again.\"\n\nSara's return to the lab three seasons ago has confused viewers for some time. She has a husband now, once suffered burnout from the cases she worked, and had worked on creating a new chapter in life. Why is she still working in Vegas? \"She is drawn to this type of work, but we will address why she continues to be drawn back to the Vegas Crime Lab,\" answers one source. \"They've become her surrogate family. There have been ties with the new team that have been established; the old team had a difficult time trying to reach out to have their own families, and the team itself became closest to them,\" they continue. This is where the creative process meets the reality of the business, also. \"Billy Petersen isn't on the show anymore, and it's difficult to get him for an appearance because there are other things going on with his life,\" they add. \"With Jorja we love the character of Sara Sidle and we love Jorja Fox. The attempt to explain her situation is challenging in a way, but we are trying to address it.\" And just because things with Sara's life are brought to a head this week, that certainly doesn't mean that the volcano of Sara is finished erupting. \"It will come to a head in Episode Fifteen, but it will have reprucussions all the way into the finale, and next season as well,\" a source previews. \"What happens in that episode is not just, &#8216;that's what happened; we're done.' It will have implications going forward.\" One theory floating around: the Grissom-Sara romance will come to an end, and Sara's emotional burdens from it carry through into the season. C'mon, Gil-you have a keeper. Fix it!\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\n\nCSI returns to UK screens early next week - Channel 5 will begin airing season 13, which kicks off with thrill-packed premiere &#8216;Karma to Burn', this coming Tuesday. After the events of the season 12 finale, the CSI team find themselves in crisis, but must overcome the odds to rescue Russell's granddaughter and bring the kidnappers to justice.\n\nTo mark the show's triumphant return, Digital Spy spoke with CSI star Jorja Fox - who plays Sara Sidle - to get all the scoop on the new season, the show's future and the possibility of a Sara / Grissom reunion...\n\nThe last season of *CSI* ended with Russell's granddaughter in deep trouble. Where does season 13 pick up?\n\n\"Pretty much everything that could go wrong has gone wrong - Russell's granddaughter has been kidnapped, Ecklie (Marc Vann) is shot and in dire jeopardy - you don't know if he's going to make it or not\n\n\"Finn (Elisabeth Shue) has disappeared off the Earth and Nick Stokes (George Eads) has quit, so pandemonium has ensued and the characters definitely spend the first half of the [season 13 premiere] running around, fearing the worst. So it's a suspenseful episode, for sure.\"\n\nSeason 12 saw Ted Danson join the show as Russell, as well as Elisabeth Shue replacing Marg Helgenberger - has this new season felt more stable?\n\n\"Yeah, actually - and a third character, Elisabeth Harnois [who plays Morgan Brody] joined two episodes before the end of season 11, so essentially her and Ted started right around the same time.\n\n\"To have three new characters in such a short period of time, it almost feels like we're doing a completely new show, but with all the perks of having done a show for such a long time - the people that you trust, the short-hand and the collaboration.\n\n\"So it's been an amazing season - season 12 and season 13 so far have been some of the most fun seasons I've ever been a part of - and yes, you're absolutely right to use the world &#8216;stable'. I would say &#8216;stable' maybe for the first time!\n\n\"Even before cast members began departing, there was always something exciting that would shake up the show at least once a year so, knock on wood, I've been enjoying that feeling [of stability].\n\n\"Season 13 is pretty much the first season of the show for many years where the writers knew what cast they would have to write for - pretty much every year they would end and they wouldn't know who was coming back [the following season], so it was very difficult for them to start early on stories.\"\n\nThe second episode of this season is a big one for Sara, isn't it?\n\n\"I think it's the biggest departure for the show this season - we're doing something we've never done before, in that virtually every episode so far has had a very profound personal storyline for at least one character on the show.\n\n\"It's something that we've tended to avoid often in the past - we'd maybe do this kind of stuff every ten episodes, or once a season - but we're getting to the core and the heart of the matter with season 13, so I hope everybody enjoys it.\"\n\nEpisode seven &#8216;Fallen Angels' also contains nods to the past and to the character of Warrick Brown - what can you reveal about that?\n\n\"It was a tough one to shoot, because I miss Gary Dourdan every day. It's funny - he's been gone for a long time and I still miss him on the show. I miss his character, I miss his energy - so it was hard to go back.\n\n\"Of course, in the make-believe world of CSI, you're also going back into the life of one of your best friends who's passed away and we find out that things are not going so well [for his family], so I think it is a really awesome episode. Meta Golding, who plays Warrick's wife on the show, is brilliant. But it was hard - it was one of those ones that was heartbreaking to do.\"\n\nThere's also going to be a crossover between *CSI* and *CSI: NY* - what role does Sara play in that?\n\n\"Gary Sinise's character from CSI: NY - because he's in our show, he's having a profound personal problem. He crossed over into Las Vegas and now he's in the land of personal nightmares and demons!\n\n\"But he arrives in Las Vegas and this [case] is something that Russell is helping with very closely. My character in the CSI part of the crossover is off on a different crime with Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) that involves grifting - which is always really fascinating in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThere have been rumors that we might finally meet Sara's mother - do you know if that is happening?\n\n\"Gosh, that's been a rumor since season two! I can't confirm or deny it, but I would love to meet her too. She's a scary person! I can't confirm it, but that sounds great, so I hope so.\"\n\nDo you have a dream actress in mind for the role?\n\n\"There's a really, really long list, but I'd have to say Mary Tyler Moore - I just love her so much, I'd love the chance to see her on the show.\"\n\nAre there any plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to make another appearance following his cameo in season eleven?\n\n\"I think that there is some stuff [planned] - I'm always hoping for it. I feel like Sara's a little young to sleep alone every night and she's still very much in love with Grissom, so we're always thinking about and hoping for some type of reunion between the two of them - at least I am. That will be a story for Sara in season 13 - what it's like to have a long-distance relationship and how she's weathering all that.\"\n\nLast year, *CSI* was named the most watched show in the world for the fifth time. How does it feel knowing that the show remains a global phenomenon 13 seasons in?\n\n\"It's astounding - it's one of the highest fan compliments the show could ever receive. We were floating on air about it for several weeks and it's always a surprise. It means so much that it's international, that it's global - we're tucked away in California doing the show, and I think we all want to be out in the world more than we are. To find out that there's folks out all over who are watching is an amazing feeling.\"\n\n*CSI: Miami* sadly ended last year, but do you think there is still plenty of life left in the original *CSI*?\n\n\"I do, for sure. Again, we've been so lucky - I don't think anybody's bored yet. I can't believe I've had the same job this long - as an actor, I didn't even know that was possible.\n\n\"The fact that I continue to be excited to go to work every day and I absolutely adore the people I'm working with and unfortunately in the United States there's no shortage of crimes to tell stories about! So yeah, I'd like to see us go for a couple more years, I think we got it in us.\n\n\"We've reached a place with the show where we pretty much get picked up for one season at a time and that's okay - it's always been a pleasant surprise to find out that we were going to go another year. I think that we're certainly one of the grandparents of TV right now in the States - if we were a person, we'd have our little cane and hearing aid and that's a very nice place to be in!\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nCSI returns to UK TV tonight, with the American goliath that&rsquo;s spawned not only the rise of the pathology TV show, but also thousands of careers in forensics back to defend its crown on Channel 5.\n\nAs she begins to start her latest tour of duty as the devoted Sara Silde on the show, we chatted to star Jorja Fox about being on the show for more than a decade, the world of forensics and her dreams of being a rock and roll star.\n\nThe show&rsquo;s going into its thirteenth season over here in the UK, did you ever think it would be so successful?\n\nYou know it&rsquo;s really been a surprise and an incredible honour that we&rsquo;re still going. I&rsquo;d just like to give a shout out to our international fans for tuning in and watching. I think that we&rsquo;re very mystified every year when we&rsquo;re invited to do another (laughs). That&rsquo;s a great feeling.\n\nWhat&rsquo;s it like playing Sara for so long?\n\nI never imagined I would play the same character for anywhere near this amount of time. I think that as a younger person, I thought &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be great to play her for a year of two if I&rsquo;m fortunate&rsquo; and thank goodness I really adore Sara, so it makes it so easy to play her. I feel like I&rsquo;m in a place where I put on the vest, put on the boots, grab the pun and instantly I feel like her.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a really interesting experience, because as an actor you never stop building the character and asking how they&rsquo;d react to things, but with her I feel that very quickly I know who she&rsquo;d respond to almost anything.\n\nThe writers keep Sara interesting for us at home, but what about for you. How do you keep her fresh and interesting to play after all this time?\n\nWell, I hope she&rsquo;s interesting to the people at home; she&rsquo;s always interesting for me. Number one because she&rsquo;s really smart and I&rsquo;m not (laughs). It&rsquo;s always fascinating that she can figure out these puzzles. The show also changes week to week, every time the characters are interacting in completely different situations, which keeps the characters fresh.\n\nWhen I think that we&rsquo;ve told every crime out there we can tell, the writers come up with something new, weirder, crazier and darker than before. It keeps us on our toes all the time. This year, we&rsquo;re doing something we&rsquo;ve not done before as each week we deal with something very personal to each of the characters on the show.\n\nSo for Sara, she&rsquo;s going down some roads she&rsquo;s never been down before. It&rsquo;s personal and profoundly intimate and in some ways secretive, so that&rsquo;s a really interesting new thing.\n\nAs you said, this series is definitely more personal, but have any of the storylines affected you personally?\n\nYeah, for sure. Episode seven goes back to Warwick&rsquo;s life and see what&rsquo;s become of his family since he passed away and that one was a really hard episode to shoot for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I still miss Gary Dourdan every week; I miss both him and the character on the show.\n\nAlso, as actors, I think we&rsquo;ve all lost someone very close to us, nobody gets on and off the planet without leaving people they really care about. So it was a little bit heart breaking and it really resonated with me personally.\n\nHopefully, some of the storylines are almost fun. We have this dynamic between Hodges and Morgan, which is all about whether you can love somebody at work and are you compatible away from that, so there&rsquo;s some comedy to that, but once again, it&rsquo;s very personal.\n\nAlso, because Ted Danson&rsquo;s on the show, hopefully not only because of him, the show&rsquo;s funnier and I think the writers have taken more risks with comedy than they have done in the past. That&rsquo;s been so much fun to shoot around, even though I don&rsquo;t get much of it. I&rsquo;m the girl, who gets the really dark stuff, but other characters are having really funny lines and it&rsquo;s hard not to laugh.\n\nElizabeth Shue joined the cast last year, what&rsquo;s it been like showing her the rope and working with her?\n\nWell, she&rsquo;s so humble, but she&rsquo;s a theatrical legend in the United States. She&rsquo;s so much fun, kind of trouble, got the sort of fun loving personality that gets a girl into trouble and for her to come in and be so humble was so great and really unexpected. She picked up everything very quickly. You&rsquo;ve got these new characters and I love all three of them and I can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I am to work with them every week.\n\nSo for the first three of four episodes we had to show them the ropes and how everything gets done around here and now all three do everything better than me and drive me crazy! (laughs) They&rsquo;ve learnt their lines faster, they get their science talk done more smoothly, I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;Ok, guys, take it easy, you&rsquo;re making us all feel dumb&rdquo;. Its gives me something to aspire too (laughs).\n\nIs it true that you have a rather special guitar?\n\nOh, I do, I wish I could play it the way I feel like it should! I like to actually loan it to people to play because it&rsquo;s just an amazing guitar and I never really do it any justice. I have this blonde 1965 hollow body Rickenbacher and they didn&rsquo;t make many of them and it&rsquo;s really just like listening to angels.\n\nIs music something you&rsquo;d like to explore more then?\n\nI don&rsquo;t have the time yet. Oddly enough when I was younger my number one dream was to be the lead singer in a rock and roll band. Acting ended up being the place where I was able to carve out a living for myself, so there was a point where I let go of music professionally.\n\nIt was hard for a minute, letting go of any dream is going to be like that, but it&rsquo;s something that I do now just for the fun of it. I love the fact that it&rsquo;s not professional, that it&rsquo;s just me and some friends who get together and play. It&rsquo;s nice to have something that&rsquo;s not about making a living or trying to impress anyone else.\n\n*The show&rsquo;s become quite famous for actually inspiring some people to actively pursue a career in *\n\nI think it&rsquo;s really one of the highest compliments you can get. Being on the show for thirteen years, there a lot of kids who watched the show who are now total adults and to imagine that expanse of time is really interesting. I think that there are a lot of smart people out there that watch the show and engage with it and I think it&rsquo;s fantastic to think we&rsquo;ve been a part in a resurgence of science. &nbsp;I think only great things can come from that.\n\nI think it&rsquo;s going to be very hard for criminals to get away with things with so many forensic guys around. Then perhaps we can make the world peaceful enough that we have to stop the show as there&rsquo;s no more crime.\n\nSo CSI&rsquo;s just actually a massive Public Service Announcement then?\n\n(laughs) Exactly! It&rsquo;s really hard to get away with crimes now, thank God! There have been so many technological advancements over the last twenty years and thinks like DNA evidence helps keep people who are innocent from spending a decade in jail. Those sorts of breakthroughs are incredible. Of course criminals are also coming up with new ways to commit crimes, and crime fighters have to come up with new ways to beat them. I find it a fascinating dance.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nThe 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nA cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.\n\nThe evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on \"CSI,\" one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series. The actor, who also appeared on \"ER\" and in a story arc on \"The West Wing,\" seems to have a knack for connecting with popular television dramas.\n\nFox was in Hawaii to promote the documentary \"Lion Ark,\" along with producers/filmmakers/activists Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, founders of Animal Defenders International.\n\nThe film depicts the rescue of 25 African lions from Bolivian circuses, in the wake of a 2010 law prohibiting the use of animals in traveling shows. Phillips and Creamer, whove made their first full-length film with \"Lion Ark,\" were right there every step of the way.\n\nThe subject matter is dramatic and gripping  the quest brought the filmmakers into remote parts of Bolivia, and often circuses were not cooperative. In the films opening scenes, a circus operator, waving a knife, slashes their tires to try to prevent a rescue.\n\nIt also has a happy ending, as Fox and the filmmakers take pains to point out: All of the lions at risk were airlifted out of Bolivia, finding a home at a sprawling sanctuary in Colorado, where a giant (80-acre) protective enclosure was custom-built for the lions to help them adjust to the colder climate.\n\n\"I like to think of it as an action-adventure-dramedy,\" Fox said, partially joking. \"There are some funny moments in it, but there is epic drama. To get to be a part of it was fantastic.\"\n\nFox was there as the lions were being taken to shelter in Colorado, as is seen in the film.\n\n\"To be surrounded by 25 roaring lions  that real, raw power was an experience Ill never forget,\" she said.\n\nCreamer can speak passionately about the mistreatment imposed on animals in traveling circuses, while Phillips emphasizes their work is based on strictly factual findings  often uncovered by working surreptitiously to gather evidence on the scene, as the filmmakers did for years in Bolivia.\n\nFOX HAS worked with Phillips and Creamer for more than seven years, beginning with a collaboration on the short documentary film, \"How I Became an Elephant.\" Fox served as producer for that film, which exposes the treatment of elephants as \"performers\" in traveling shows and in movies.\n\nFox was involved with \"Lion Ark\" from the beginning, consulting with the filmmakers on the eye-witness approach and stepping in front of the camera during scenes films when the lions arrive in Colorado.\n\nShes also supporting the film by appearing at HIFF. Shell be at Dole Cannery on Saturday, Oct. 12, for the screening of \"Lion Ark.\"\n\n\"Ive been passionate about the environment, marine protection and wildlife, all my life,\" Fox said, explaining why she got involved. Born in New York City, she lived in Melbourne, Florida with her family as a child. Now based in L.A., shes a surfer.\n\n\"I was very familiar with Hawaii, but I wasnt that familiar with the festival until Jan and Tim got invited to come,\" Fox confided.\n\nAs she spoke, a stylish woman with close-cropped hair leaned over our table to say, \"Sorry to interrupt, but we love your show. I just had to come over and tell you that!\"\n\nTHE SHOW, of course, is \"CSI,\" which is about to reach a huge milestone: the airing of its 300th episode.\n\nThe episode has already been filmed, Fox said.\n\n\"Its going to be amazing, thats all I can say,\" she said. \"We didnt really think it was that big a deal until we started shooting it, and then we started realizing that its pretty rare.\n\n\"With the new shows especially, so many of them are doing 13 episodes a season instead of 24  its going to take them 26 years to get to 300 episodes! I dont know that that many new shows are going to get there.\"\n\n\"We tried to enjoy every minute\" of filming, she said. Special care was taken in writing the scenes, and some pieces of the episode pay tribute to the series long history, including \"faux-back\" segments that recreate characters storylines reaching back to the shows first year. Original cast member Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) is also back for the 300th show.\n\nI asked Fox how long the wild ride that has been \"CSI\" can last, and she responded that its up to viewers.\n\n\"I hope my favorite episode is yet to come,\" she said. \"Its lasted far longer than I ever anticipated.  Now, I think Ill do it as long as the fans want us to do it.\n\n\"I cant even imagine leaving at this point. It would seem foolish.\"\n\nIN THE MEANTIME, Fox is hoping for big audiences and international impact with \"Lion Ark.\" The film was just awarded the Audience Award at the San Diego Film Festival, where it sold out its screening. Screenings also sold out at Londons Raindance Film Festival, an offshoot of Robert Redfords Sundance Film Festival in Colorado.\n\nAsked what she learned from working on \"Lion Ark,\" Fox said, \"Anything is possible. If you put your heart and soul to it, you can move mountains.\"\n\nThe Hawaiian Humane Society has teamed up with Animal Defenders International to promote \"Lion Ark\" at HIFF. For more on efforts to improve conditions for captive or domesticated animals here in Hawaii, go to hawaiianhumane.org.\n\n[...]\n\n",

But I had this one emotional scene across from Jorja Fox. She was so gracious and open and warm, it helped me get to where I needed to be. I remember that vividly. They shot me first, she was so patient. I had to excuse myself from the set for a moment, and she was so open to what I needed as an actor.

Jorja plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the long running series. In real life, she volunteers as an ambassador for Animal Defenders International.\n\n\"Calling attention to these issueswhether it is on \"CSI\" or with Animal Defenders Internationalis a passion of mine,\" says Jorja. \"\"CSI\"s writers care about these issues too, and do such a great job in weaving them into the show.\"\n\n\"'ADI Ambassador\"'\n\nJorja, who has been on \"CSI\" since its inception in 2000, considers herself fortunate to have landed a role that she cherishes. She also is grateful to be a spokesperson for Animal Defenders International (ADI). \"Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, the husband and wife team who founded ADI, have done so much to call attention to rescue and to stop animal abuse,\" says Jorja. \"Im honored to work with them and to serve as an ambassador for ADI.\"\n\nADI, which was launched in 1990, publishes reports, educates the public, and drafts legislation for animals worldwide. One of their latest animal welfare projects was exposing the cruel treatment of circus animals in Bolivia. \"They went undercover to rescue and relocate 29 circus lions via airlift to safe sanctuaries in the United States,\" says Jorja. (A short film about the rescue can be seen on ADIs website.)\n\nThrough her work at ADI, Jorja has done public service announcements and testified before Congress. Jorja is a 2012 recipient of ADIs Animal Champion Award for her dedication to sustaining safe environments for animals in entertainment.\n\n\"'A Long Time Love Affair with Animals\"'\n\nBorn in New York City, Jorja moved with her family to Melbourne Beach, FL, when she was about three. \"Its a barrier island, and there was a lot more wildlife back then than there is now,\" she laments. \"You could see dolphins in the ocean, sea turtles, and even alligators. It was the wilderness for my parents, who are both from New York.\"\n\n\"I learned a lot about conservation from my grandmother, and my family always cared about animals,\" she adds. \"Caring for the environment impacts all of uspeople and animals. We had a family dog, and lots of wildlife around us, which I grew to appreciate.\"\n\nToday, she has a three-year old rescue dog, which she says, \"is the most brilliant dog in the world.\"\n\n\"'Animals and the Environment\"'\n\n\"A lot of people dont see the connection between animal extinction and the environment,\" says Jorja, who recently produced an award winning documentary called \"How I Became An Elephant\", which tracks the journey of a young girl who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. \"People dont know that without elephants there would be horrible droughts,\" she says.\n\nElephants are known as a keystone species because of their impact on their environment and their impact on other species that share their space. \"Elephants are very good at finding underground water,\" Jorja explains. \"They locate water and dig watering holes. Without that water, other animals and humans would be harmed. Mass extinctions could occur.\"\n\nElephants also disperse seeds through their digestive systems. Thanks to elephants who spread these seeds, more plants appear, which other animals are dependent on. \"Its an important cycle,\" says Jorja. \"That is why we all need to care about animals.\"\n\n",

Bexar (pronounded \"bear\") had been found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas, but it wasn't exactly love at first sight. \n\n\"I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit and she did the same to me  Then all of a sudden, it flipped, and now I'm completely in love with her,\" Fox admits. \"She's the coolest, little scruffy dog I ever knew.\" \n\nWhile Fox has fallen head over heels for the poodle mix, she's also passionate about saving other animals in her role as ambassador for Animal Defenders International.

        "content": "\nActress* Jorja Fox* is standing in the middle of an airplane hangar in Boulder, Colorado, watching the doors of a Bolivian cargo jet open up. While the sun sets over the Rocky Mountains, individual crates housing twenty-five African lions are unloaded. Although from different prides, the lions share the same fate: rescued from circus abuse, they're about to embark on a new life. All of a sudden, one lion after the other starts roaring, the sound bouncing off the walls in the giant hangar. A lion's roar can travel up to five miles, and the roars turn into a symphony never before heard on the Colorado plains. \"It's a sound that completely penetrates you,\" says Jorja. \"You can feel those roars in your muscles and bones. If something like that had happened in the wild, where I was surrounded by twenty-five lions, I would've been petrified! But I wasn't scared. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever felt.\"\n\nAnimal rescuer is a role that suits Jorja perfectly. A vegetarian since age 18, she became an ambassador for Animal Defenders International six years ago and has since saved both elephants and lions. The historic lion rescue, which is the subject of the documentary Lion Ark, is the largest of its kind and was the result of ADI's work helping ban the use of circus animals in Bolivia. \"If you knew the abuse the animals suffer behind-the-scenes, you would never set your foot in a circus,\" says Jorja. \"There are far cooler things these animals can be doing.\"\n\nAt home in Los Angeles, the actress spends time with another four-legged creature, her rescue dog Bexar. And she gets a major kick out of her role as Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which recently celebrated its 300th episode. \"The scripts still give me nightmares!\" says Jorja, who also starred on ER and The West Wing. \"I only read them at night if I'm absolutely desperate. I rather get up first thing in the morning so my brain has all day to organize all those gory details and put them away somewhere before I go to bed.\"\n\nJorja, who was photographed for Sweden With Love by Elizabeth Messina, has a quick, easy laugh that is utterly contagious. In an exclusive interview, she talks surprisingly honestly — and hilariously — about being in her mid 40s. She also dishes on working with the \"very distracting\" George Clooney for three years on ER, how she keeps in shape and the secret passion she's \"not very good at\" but still loves. Jorja's kindness and gutsy spirit is refreshing, and her joy for life is contagious. Enjoy!\n\nUlrica: It's not often you find a woman — especially in Hollywood — as comfortable in her own skin as you are. You seem to have avoided all the trappings of turning 40.\n\nJorja: You know, I tried to lie about my age for years! I cheated myself down five years for the longest time. But then one day, the Internet just corrected it. Now, my age is everywhere and there's no way to escape it. Everybody knows how old I am! I couldn't hide it even if I wanted to.\n\nUlrica: How do you deal with the pressure of staying eternally young? I think we all experience it on some level, even if we're not in the public eye like you are.\n\nJorja: It really helps to have other women around you that are about the same age and who look and feel great about themselves. You know what's cool? Elisabeth Shue and I are on the show together and we're close in age. She's gorgeous and down-to-earth and that's really inspiring to me. It's so fun, especially now being in my mid 40s, to have another woman around who is dealing with the same issues I am. I look at her and go, ‘Wow, she looks amazing!' I don't think any of us ever thought we'd get old on CSI, and no, we're not getting old yet, but we're aging very publicly and sometimes that can be hard. It's a good problem to have, of course, but it's nice to be able to share thoughts about wrinkles with other women who are the same age as you.\n\nUlrica: You know that phenomenon that happens when you live in L.A. and no one ever gets older? Do you ever feel that way?\n\nJorja: Yes! I have a grandmother here, so I see a whole bunch of senior citizens regularly. But I don't really see people aging. There doesn't seem to be anyone in between here. There are senior citizens and then there are all these other ageless people. I guess you've got to go somewhere else, you've got to disappear for a decade, and then come back and reintroduce yourself as a senior citizen with white hair [laugh].\n\n**Ulrica: I find that, for each year that goes by, there's also a greater sense of freedom because you stop caring about all the crap you used to care about.  \n**\n\nJorja: You're so right. I really don't care about what people think about me and it's such a relief. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I always thought about how I was perceived. Was I pretty enough? Was I cool enough? I just don't have those anxieties anymore. I don't worry about if I'm pretty enough or cool enough or fashionable enough. Those are the shallow ways we torture ourselves when we're younger! That said, it's still really important to me how people perceive me in terms of being a decent human being. But that stage when you're constantly worrying about if you're pretty enough or loud enough or quiet enough or anything enough? I'm so glad I'm over that stage. There's such freedom in not having to worry about those things.\n\nUlrica: Okay, give me the dirt. You worked with George Clooney for three years on *ER*. Is he really as cool as he seems?\n\nJorja: Yes, he's really as cool as he seems. He really is. Even from thirty feet away, there's that energy and charisma. You can't quite escape it. It's this amazingness and sexiness that radiate from wherever he is. It's really really distracting! I don't think I ever got over it, even during the three years that I worked with him. On top of that, he's so funny and disarming. During rehearsals, he would spend the entire time telling jokes and doing pranks. You never rehearsed until you were shooting with him. It would always throw me off my game. So yes, he's a really great, talented and very distracting man!\n\n*Ulrica: *ER was a huge hit when you joined the cast, and that was a big turning point for you. So many actors on that show were catapulted into fame. Were you scared at all? **\n\nJorja: I was completely terrified. I thought, \"This is the moment when everyone in the world is going to realize I'm an impostor.\" So many people were watching that show. There was this very real moment, the day before I was going to start on ER, when I was sitting in my apartment in LA mapping out my escape to Mexico. I had it all planned out. I was going to drive to Mexico that night and be there before the morning. I would then call my manager and say I'd quit acting before any damage had been done. It was that moment of, \"This is it. You either get out now or you move forward.\" Fortunately, I decided to move forward. But every day I was there, I thought, \"If they don't fire me today, they'll fire me tomorrow.\" I still think that sometimes when I drive in to work on CSI. It certainly keeps me on my toes. But I've been on a show now for 18 consecutive seasons now, so I'm going to have to go for 20!\n\n*Ulrica: As a child, I never felt comfortable visiting the zoo or going to the circus, and I refuse to take my own kids to a circus or a zoo now. So your work raising awareness about animals in circuses really speaks to me. *\n\nJorja: So many of us, when we were kids and went to the circus or the zoo or the marine park for the first time, sensed there was something we didn't like. Yes, it's amazing to be able to see these animals, but the conditions they're living in are not right. You take these huge land mammals like elephants, who easily walks 30 miles a day in the wild, and put them in tiny cages until they have to perform, sometimes several times a day, for years and years until they die. They're abused, hit and scared into performing and they develop serious mental and physical illnesses. The bull hook, for example, is a standard instrument used for training elephants and it's very violent. Watching Lion Ark, it's so easy to connect the dots.\n\nUlrica: Why do you think there's such a disconnect between our natural love for animals and the way they're actually treated in our society?\n\nJorja: I think we're taught from a very early age to have a certain mindset in relation to animals. They're in our clothing, in our diets, in our makeup…they're entertainment and they're our pets. In some ways, you have to shut down to accept some of the roles animals play in modern society. You have to detach and disassociate yourself with the meat that's in the grocery store, or the animals performing at the circus, or the leather shoes you're wearing, in order to live life a certain way. You don't have to think about your dinner choices at all, unless you really want to go out of your way to think about them. Society makes it easy for us to ignore these complex issues. But I think twenty years from now, with these environmental issues reaching such critical mass, there will be enormous progress in terms of the way we treat animals. I think people are very compassionate in general, and we all want to do the right thing.\n\nUlrica: So many people say, ‘Why do you care about animal rights when people are starving all over the world?'\n\nJorja: I'm extremely passionate about human rights, environmental rights and animal welfare and it would be very hard for me to separate the three. They're all interconnected and interrelated. If you look beneath the surface of an animal welfare issue, you'll usually find an environmental issue and a human rights issue.\n\nUlrica: You've been a vegetarian for 25 years. Why is that?\n\nJorja: I believe in non-violence, so it was a really easy thing for me to do. Living in New York and Los Angeles, there was no reason for me to eat meat for my survival. It's worked out really great and I don't miss meat at all. For me, it was never really for health reasons, but so many of the things we're now learning about health and nutrition makes it a really exciting time to be a vegetarian or vegan. The cuisine is busting out! Some of the most exciting cuisine on the planet is happening in vegetarian or vegan cooking.\n\n*Ulrica: I became a vegan on a silly dare two years ago, just because I wanted to lose weight after I had my third child. I know my intentions were not the most honorable, but my body felt so different that I stuck with it. And I swear, in the process, my heart changed. In general, I just feel more compassion. *\n\nJorja: That's fascinating! I was 18 when I became a vegetarian, so I don't remember some of the more subtle things, but it doesn't shock me. You know, even if you don't want to become a vegetarian or vegan, it's a great thing to try out. Do meatless Mondays to start, and see how you feel. Even if you don't care about animals or the environment, you'll lose weight and you'll feel better. And if you do care about animals and the environment…truthfully, the single greatest thing anyone could do for animals or the environment on a daily basis is to become a vegetarian or vegan.\n\nUlrica: We need to talk about your dog Bexar, because she's too adorable!\n\nJorja: She was found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas, so that's why I named her Bexar. She's a curly, floppy mutt that probably has some poodle in her. When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of fourteen years. My dog died in January, and when Bexar showed up in my life in May I wasn't quite ready for another dog. I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit, and she did the same to me. I don't think she wanted me, either! Then all of a sudden, it flipped. Now I'm completely in love with her. I adore her and she's amazing. She's the coolest, little scruffiest dog I ever knew.\n\nUlrica: I know you love to surf. Is that how you keep fit?\n\nJorja: I never feel all that fit, but I love to work out because it calms my mind. I love to surf. I love to just be in the ocean and be a part of nature, and it keeps you really fit. Paddling out gives you a great arm and back workout. I also do yoga, and I take my dog [she has a rescue mutt, part poodle, that she found in Texas] on hikes. When I can't go surfing, I work out with my trainer John Pierre at home. We have a routine I just started this summer that is tailored for me and keeps my body fit for surfing when I can't get out in the water.\n\nUlrica: Lastly, do you have a secret talent no one knows about?\n\nJorja: [laugh] Probably not! But I really love to garden. I won't say I'm any good at it, but I love it so much. And I love to meander around my house. I've never had a designer or a decorator. I don't have any talent for home decor, but it's something that I secretly enjoy when I have the time. I like to find things that are vintage or reclaimed. I've had my house for almost ten years, and it's still not done! But part of me doesn't want it to be done, because I don't want the project to be over. There are still rooms that need to be painted and pieces I have to find, like a new table for my breakfast nook. I've been looking for that table for two years! So even though it's not something I'm talent at, it's a secret passion.\"\n\nJorja recently produced the award-winning documentary How I Became An Elephant, about one young girl's mission to travel to Asia to work with her hero, The Elephant Lady, and save elephants in captivity.\n\n[...]\n\n",

How does that store compare to the rest of this series?\n\nThis season is unique, because almost every episode impacts on one of the characters in a personal level. In an episode we shot recently, Sara's ex-boyfriend comes to town, and she has to grapple with that. For her, there's always a steady theme of love ... or not! She's married to someone she's deeply in love with, but she doesn't see him very much.\n\nOf course, her husband is former colleague Gil Grissom. Were you showed when they ended up together?\n\nWell, the bigger surprise for me was that I returned to the show! I came back in the eighth season, when Gil was leaving, to tell that storyline. I never imagined that I would be invited to return to the show, and of course, when I was asked, I couldn't say no, because it's been such an amazing ride. I knew that Gil and Sara were going to take off, but I didn't know that Sara was ever going to come back.\n\nHow have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?\n\nWell, the biggest compliment is that last year we were the most popular show in the world again.

        "content": "\nThere has always been a great divide amongst the fans of CSI, between those who love Grissom and Sara together and those who, I don’t know, hate romance and kick puppies for fun. Up until last night, the fans of GSR had pretty much won most of the battles in this cold war, but with “Forget Me Not,” this week’s episode, the other side landed a major, heart-breaking victory when Sara revealed that she and Grissom have separated.\n\nHow did this happen? Well, in true* CSI *fashion, the writers didn’t seem at all interested in explaining their reasons for this twist. It’s apparently enough for them just to imply that it was Grissom’s choice and that he might have been doing it for what he considers to be Sara’s benefit. Anyone who knows the history between them, though, knows that Grissom has not always been the best judge of his own needs and wants, much less Sara’s. It’s going to be very easy for the anti-Sara crowd to point their fingers and blame her for the breakup, and the writers made it very easy for them by having her immediately fool around with another man, but the real question is why did this incredibly strong woman, who never gave up on her love for an impossible man, give up on her marriage?\n\nI don’t believe she has. She’s still wearing her wedding ring, she is still calling him her husband, she hasn’t removed any of their photos from their ridiculously gorgeous house, and she couldn’t bring herself to tell anyone that it had actually happened until she absolutely couldn’t avoid it. If she’s still hopeful, I’m still hopeful, no matter what the writers might have been trying to tell half of their audience through the supposedly-wise wisdom of Nick in the final scene with him and Sara and Greg. (That is not a diss on Nick; I thought he was great in the rest of the episode, defending not only Sara’s life, but her privacy.) “If it’s over, it’s over”? The only “over” I will accept is if Grissom and Sara are still separated at the series finale. And even then there’s always fan fiction.\n\nMoving on, the case itself was compelling by the very nature of what being framed for murder put Sara through. The humiliation of having her private life become hallway gossip, the mortification of being booked and processed…she bore all of it, confident that her teammates would prove her innocence. She even pinpointed the real murderer, the crazy stalker from a few months back who blamed Sara for the death of his stalkee, and wanted to make her pay for keeping them apart. It was an insanely emotional week for Sara.\n\nSo, what better time to introduce her mother? Um…how about in any other episode where there might have been a touch more time to actually utilize such a long-awaited, highly anticipated, much-speculated character? We’ve all been wondering about Laura Sidle since the day we saw Sara researching her court case back in season five. That was almost eight years ago. Why the sudden rush to cram her into this particular episode? Sara was already on to her stalker, so just knowing that he’d contacted her mother only gave her slightly more resolve to take him down. In other words, what did having Laura in this episode really do? Are we going to see her again soon? Are we going to see a woman who stabbed her husband seven times try to give her daughter advice about her own marriage? I kind of hope not. If anything, maybe she could just be a shoulder for Sara to lean on.\n\nTruthfully, though, Sara already has two really good (and nicely muscled) pairs of shoulders in Nick and Greg, her long-time teammates and friends. I can’t say much for this episode, but I will say that in this particular area, they got it right. The three of them are the last of the original cast (since apparently Brass has vanished) and it was really great to see the boys have Sara’s back through thick and thin. That is why, even though the GSR community is devastated, we are not defeated. Some of us may jump ship, and we will mourn them, but the rest of us will strap ourselves to the mast and ride out the storm on the faith that there will be calmer waters ahead. And that’s as far as I can take the shipping metaphor.\n\n[...]\n\n",

I had a little bit with Jorja and I had a little bit with Lisa but I would love for us girls to have to band together for a really cool power girl episode. Not a Charlies Angels kind of thing but an episode that requires that it has to be them that come to the forefront. Weve all said that we would love to have that kind of an episode for the three of us because we all really like each other and were all very opinionated strong women.  \n",

I know William Petersen won't be back on the show, but would it have been so bad to keep him off-screen like he has been, and let the writers keep their marriage safe and in the background? It's a procedural, for heaven's sake, not Grey's Anatomy. And their fans would be content to at least know they have a good, albeit non-traditional marriage. This just seems so harsh to me. There was a carefully constructed arc for their story over 12 years; in a few episodes it seems to be completely destroyed. The show will probably not be around much longer, so why? They seem to not care about their old loyal fans, and certainly have disregarded the avid GSR fanbase. I know it's silly to get caught up in fictional &#8216;ships (and this is the only one I ever became invested in), but this one seemed like it would really make it after that wonderful final scene of Grissom and Sara in the jungle. Now it's just ... ugh ... so frustrating. It taints the whole series for me, and certainly erases Petersen's wonderful exit arc.  Jan\n\nMatt Roush: I'm not sure how wonderful or satisfying Grissom's exit arc was  the show never really recovered from losing him  and I always found this off-camera relationship puzzling and a bit off-putting, but I'm more upset to think I have a \"stock answer\" for this sort of thing. Because I do think you have a point where this show and these characters are concerned. At least Nick was able to express the feelings I imagine so many longtime *CSI *fans have, that we accepted and perhaps even embraced the idea of the Sara-Grissom marriage because it sustained a connection, however tenuous, with the show's most beloved character. I may not be as upset as the \"shippers\" about the dissolving of the marriage  how many long-distance relationships ever work?  but the way it was addressed so off-handedly, keeping the drama of the split off-stage as usual, would have to be a letdown to anyone who has an investment in these characters. That said, I thought Jorja Fox did a fine job expressing Sara's sadness and loneliness, even in the context of yet another episode in which a crime-solver is accused of a crime she so clearly didn't commit.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\n \"'Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox answer burning questions about Sara's return and the crime show's killer new season\"'\n\n*The most baffling crime on *CSI last season wasn't a stabbing or shooting. It was a missing persons case: The show's lead investigator for its first nine seasons, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), left the series halfway through the year, sending CSI&#8216;s ratings slipping and causing concern for its cast and producers.\n\n\"We look at last season in a way not dissimilar from the fans,\" admits executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. \"We may have shortchanged a number of our characters in being focused on the transition from Grissom's team to Catherine's. We;ll try to make up for that this season.\n\nFrom the opening scene, it's clear the mood is deadly on the graveyard shift. The team is \"fractured,\" says Mendelsohn. Enter Jorja Fox, who's back, at least temporarily, to help Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) get the CSIs to play nice again. But where's Grissom? \"The audience will know in very short order the status of Grissom and Sara,\" Mendelsohn promises. \"I can say that between the time they left and now, there are no little Grissoms out there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, both Nick Stokes (George Eads) and Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) get promoted and start a season-long hunt for a serial killer. \"The crime scene for this killer is a body,\" says Mendelsohn.\n\nThe case may also be just the thing to bring the team together and feeling like a family again. \"We were out of our rhythm a bit last year,\" says Eads. \"We needed to go back to the garage and find what inspired us, and there's some good stuff with what's happening on the show now.\"\n\nThat starts with the return of Fox, whose departure two seasons ago \"felt like we lost our lead guitarist,\" Eads adds. So, as CSI tunes up for its 10th season, TV GUIDE MAGAZINE sat down with Fox and Helgenberger to ask them questions send in by fans on [http://tvguidemagazine.com tvguidemagazine.com], and found out how the team is getting its mojo back.\n\n* *\n\nWhat would you like to see this year on *CSI* that hasn't already been done?  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #9000A1;\"Marg:/strong A musical episode!

I don't think the writers think it's a great idea.  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #339999;\"Jorja:/strong I've been advocating for the CSI musical episode for a long time. And not because I have any talent musically, because I don't. Everybody else does.

When I said my goodbyes, with cake in my mouth and flowers in my arms, the last thing I said to the producers was I'd love to visit. But this was very unexpected.\n\nIs it possible Sara will return for good?  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #339999;\"Jorja:/strong I'll just say I'm very pleased with what they've come up with to bring Sara back. You do learn a little about what she's been up to. I was pleasantly intrigued.\n\nMarg, are you happy to have Jorja back on the set so you're not the only woman?  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #339999;\"Jorja:/strong I'm gonna cover my ears!  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #9000A1;\"Marg:/strong Well, obviously, Lauren Lee Smith [who played Riley Adams] was with us last year, but there was a time before she joked us that I was the only woman, for the most part, other than Liz Vassey in the lab and Sheeri Rappaport. Not that I minded being around all these guys, 'cause they're all really great and cool and sexy and all that stuff. but there needed to be more of a presence of female power. So I was thrilled to have Jorja back. She's just the coolest chick on the planet.\n\nCatherine and Sara have never really had a close friendship. Will they become closer?  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #9000A1;\"Marg:/strong I've always wanted them to have a closer relationship. I liked the characters' energies together. So it hasn't been for a lack of me wanting and asking for it. I hope it happens. We do have a couple nice scenes in the first episode.  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #339999;\"Jorja:/strong I know very little about where we're going from here. Sara has pretty obvious authority issues, so when she's locked horns with Catherine, it's because Catherine's in a position to tell Sara what to do. In her mind, Sara believes she doesn't have a boss. She is her own boss. Most of their fights come out of that. They're very different women but blend marvelously together.\n\nWill we see more of Catherine as a strong supervisor this season?  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #9000A1;\"Marg:/strong Yes, you will. There is something that happens in the first episodes because someone leaks information to the press, [and the] hard-ass on the show, Ecklie [Mark Vann], has to come down on someone, so it's the leader. I think you'll see Catherine on top of her game, confident.  \n  \nstrong style=\"color: #339999;\"Jorja:/strong Catherine's had a leadership position on the show for some time. So it'll seem sort of seamless and subtle.

        "content": "\nWednesday's episode of CSI marks the CBS procedural's 300th episode, and no matter how you slice it, that's a lot of murder.\n\n[...]\n\nRealizing the show would reach the milestone this season, executive producer Don McGill says they wanted this entire season in general, and the 300th episode in particular, to look back at the show's history. \"When Carol and I talked about the season, [we thought,] &#8216;Back to the beginning,'\" McGill says. \"And looking at episode 300, literally we do go back to the beginning. We reference a case that was the one that got away for our CSIs.\"\n\nThe case hits particularly close to home for Sara (Jorja Fox). \"It was her first high-profile case when she came to Las Vegas,\" Fox tells us. \"She's getting a second chance at something. She's been dealing with the family for all these years and not having the answers. There's a weight and a sadness that she carries. But by the end, I think she absolutely gets some closure. And she feels fairly anchored, as much as Sara can.\"\n\nThe case involves a reclusive casino mogul (guest star Jason Priestley) who is suspected in a crime eerily similar to the case from 14 years ago. As the CSIs dig for clues, the show uses what McGill calls \"faux-backs\" to tie the two cases together. In addition to seeing Sara and Greg (Eric Szmanda) in circa 2000 looks, the episode also welcomes back original cast member Marg Helgenberger as Catherine Willows.\n\n\"We created these little vignettes,\" McGill says. \"It gave us a chance to have a window in the evolution of the characters. You could really see how far Sara has come, how far Greg has come, the influence of Catherine. It was a really fun opportunity to give a nod to how great the show is and how its longevity has really created this dynamic where we've seen the characters grow and evolve.\"\n\nThe episode will feature lots of Easter eggs, including 14 different references to the number 300. But Mendelsohn says the episode also pays appropriate homage to the show's history. \"Everybody's been asking, &#8216;What are your favorite episodes? What moments do you remember the best on set?'\" she says. \"And because we want to hark back to those iconic moments of the past, we flash back to some of the golden oldie cases. We took a poll among all the writers: What are your favorite cases? And those are the cases we flash back to during the episode.\"\n\nIn particular, the show pays homage to the show's original protagonist and leader, William Petersen's Gil Grissom. Although Grissom has only appeared a handful of times since the character was written out in Season 9, his spirit seems to always loom over the action. Mendelsohn gives Petersen credit for much of the show's success.\n\n\"Billy said, &#8216;I do not want Gil Grissom to always be right.' That became our mantra,\" Mendelsohn says. \"It allowed us to create this incredible, iconic, forensic detective. Because of Billy's instructions, he was both a student of the world and a teacher of the world. He has had such longevity and such a continuing presence on the show [because] Grissom taught all of our CSIs. And he was the teacher of all of us.\n\n\"[He took] us into a world that none of us had any exposure to and then to make science entertaining and exciting,\" she continues. \"Grissom held our hand and took us on that journey to the truth. So, we are reverential and referential to Grissom, but it's because Gil Grissom started us all on the path to forensics. He was a new kind of detective. And in a world that was often gray, Grissom always led us to the truth.\"\n\nAnd will that legacy lead to another 300 episodes? \"Greg says something to Sara at the end of 300,\" McGill says. \"It's something to the effect of, &#8216;We're only just getting started' I think Carol and I agree.\"\n\nCSI airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS.\n\n",

        "content": "\nAs per usual, our cover models are more than just pretty faces. They are co-producers of an important new film called How I Became an Elephant. This powerful documentary follows 14-year-old Juliette West who embarks on a journey to learn more about elephants in their native land. After single-handedly raising the funs for her journey, she finds herself in Southeast Asia, meeting and working with her hero, Lek Chailert. Lek is known as \"The Elephand Lady,\" and has risked her life and freedom for more than three decades to protect elephants from illegal trade and abuse. This is the story of two women, one from the East, one from the West, coming together on common ground to save elephants. It's also the coming of age story of a passionate young woman joining forces with a wise and experienced animal advocate on an enlightening journey of compassion, action and hope. The message: no matter what your age, your ethnicity, or disposition, you can make a difference. As we follow Juliette on this journey, and she uncovers the plight of these magnificent creatures, the film poses the poignant question, \"how far would you go to save a species?\"\n\nTHE PRODUCERS\n\nOur cover gal and co-producer of this film, Jorja Fox, is best known for her role on two of the longest running television series ever. In the 90s she played (vegetarian) Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, and for the past thirteen years she has played (vegetarian) forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the CBS Emmy-Award winning series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Knowing Jorja has been a vegetarian for the past 25 years of her real life, I had to ask how she managed to get to play vegetarian characters in these two popular, long-running shows.\n\nJorja says that she's very proud to play vegetarian characters, and although the story lines were not her idea, she says \"I did go to bat for pigs on both occasions.\" On ER one of the writers, invited Jorja to practice doing sutures. He suggested that she take a pig's foot home for the weekend. Jorja asked him if there were any other options and he said, \"Why? Are you a vegetarian?\" He traded out the pig's foot for an eggplant and asked if he could make the character (Maggie Doyle) vegetarian too. She was thrilled.\n\nOn CSI, a situation arose where a pig's body was to be used to recreate the timeline of a woman's murder. When Jorja read the script, she called the writer to ask if a fake pig would be used, and he also asked, \"Why? Are you a vegetarian?\" Once again her character (Sara Sidle) became a vegetarian too. Since then, Jorja's CSI character has gotten to do some pretty cool things in relation to her vegetarianism, and CSI has highlighted several animal welfare issues including shark fin soup, canned hunting, and dog fighting.\n\nJorja says that when she met the director of How I Became an Elephant, Tim Gorski, she was on the edge of her seat listening to his stories of living and working in Thailand with the elephants. She says, \"I have this amazing job in Los Angeles but I dream from time to time of working in the field. Teaming up with him was a way to support the amazing work he was doing and selfishly, kind of live vicariously through him for a little while.\"\n\nThe passion the Jorja has for this cause is apparent as she explains, \"I cant' stress enough how dire things are for elephants right now. The poaching issue in Africa has exploded again over the last few years and the habitat issue is at critical mass. People have to act now. Twenty years from now will almost certainly be too late. We have the intelligence and the tools to fix so many of these issues and frankly, people need elephants for their own survival. If elephans go the way of extinction, Africa's rain forests will be right behind them and the air that people breath will be right behind that.\"\n\n[...]\n\n",

It's a genre that's thriving to this day.\n\nPeople, since time began, have loved mysteries and so in that way it's a very, very, old concept.\n\nBut one thing that happened that was extraordinary was all this technology and stuff was bumping up against the idea of the show at the same time and I think we found ourselves at this awesome moment in history where we could tell these stories and we could do it with all these gadgets and gizmos and evolutionary things that were coming out in the real world at the same time.\n\nBeing on a successful show is the coolest thing that could ever happen to a person. I wouldn't trade it for anything, but I think I show up because I love being with the people that I get to work with every day and get to see where we are going to go together and what we are going to do.\n\nThat hasn't changed for a minute even though the show has been through so many changes and losses. I will never give up on the idea of a musical episode. I know I have been plugging away trying to convince the producers for 14 years that we could really pull off an awesome musical, so there is that dream.\n\nI think this show, is really about love in many ways -- how through all this darkness and murk and ugliness, what really keeps these people going is love.\n\nLove whether it's in a friendship, love in a romantic way.  \n\nI think (my character) Sara Sidle will always pine for Grissom.\"\n",

        "content": "\nRobert Piper: What inspires you?\n\nJorja Fox: Wow. I think I'm very easily inspired. People, wildlife, nature, music, art. I think that I'm lucky that I have this great sense of wonderment about life in general.\n\nRP: How do you stay healthy?\n\nJF: I like to think I'm healthy. I exercise a lot. I have this great dog, and I walk her about five days a week. I dance, I surf. I eat mostly vegan, try to get enough sleep. For me, that's really critical.\n\nRP: What kind of research goes into a role?\n\nJF: Well, it depends. For instance, [on] CSI is a character that I had very, very little experience with when I started, so I did a lot of research. I went to the Los Angeles crime lab; I went to the Las Vegas crime lab. Spent some time with folks that really do the job. I did a lot of reading and--thank goodness for the Internet at that time--a lot of web searches about the idea of it. Science is not something that comes all that natural to me, and then, of course, every once in a while, you'll get that character that I feel, like, Oh, I know this person or This person would be a good friend of mine or This person's a lot like me. Then, of course, there's less research involved.\n\nRP: What projects are you working on right now?\n\nJF: Right now, I'm doing the fifteenth season of CSI. We premiere September 28, so [I'm] kind of getting excited. It's always nice to be off the air, to just sort of be away somewhere, working quietly, and then it's really exciting to actually get back on the air and get that adrenaline rush every week. I'm looking forward to that.\n\nI produced a couple of documentaries recently. One of them is called Lion Art, and the other one's called Extinction Soup. Both of those documentaries are on the film-festival circuit right now. Lion Art deals with transporting twenty-five former circus lions from Bolivia to a wildlife sanctuary outside of Denver, Colo. Extinction Soup is kind of a combination of stories, but the primary purpose of the film is to sort of tell the tale of shark-fin soup and what it's doing to the oceans and to shark habitats across the globe.\n\nRP: How do you find balance in life?\n\nJF: It's really about being outside, being in nature. I can kind of go into the wild places and immediately feel rested and rejuvenated. Often, even if I'm struggling with a decision or something, if I just go out into the ocean, that answer will come without thinking about it too much. I try to balance work and play. Again, I'm really grateful that I can kind of have that philosophy, so I can try to get out of the city as much as possible, even though I love the city and I'm not ready to leave it.\n\n*Jorja Fox is an actress and musician.

        "content": "\nCSI's Sara Sidle, aka Jorga Fox, is best known for her life-saving roles on-screen, but off screen, Fox is saving animals. With Seafox Productions, the long-time animal rights activist and burgeoning producer, Fox is quickly mixing her two passions with growing documentary portfolio. Her latest endeavor, Lion Ark, has been nominated for Outstanding International Motion Picture at this weekend's 45th NAACP Image Awards.\n\nLion Ark tells the story of Animal Defenders International recent Bolivian campaign to ban traveling circuses throughout the country. In the end, ADI helped relocate many of the animals to safe, forever homes, including airlifting 25 lions from Bolivia to a reserve in Colorado.\n\nSome might recognize Fox from her earlier television roles â she played Maggie Doyle on ER from 1996 to 1999, and a * West Wing* secret service agent in 2000. But it was her animal rights activism that persuaded Jan Creamer (president of ADI) to partner with Fox. As an ADI ambassador, the actress turned producer couldn't be more thrilled about the NAACP nomination.\n\nSharpHeels: How did you get involved with Lion Ark?\n\nJorga Fox: Jan worked tirelessly on the circus bill, and then made arrangements for a whole country's worth of lions to be removed from Bolivia. I was invited to welcome the lions' arrival in Colorado.\n\nI learned they'd been documenting the process. The people at ADI had been working round the clock and were considering giving the footage away, but once I saw it I knew it had to be a feature film and that I wanted to be a part of it. I was just lucky enough to be a part of the film as it unfolded.\n\nSH: Tell me more about your role in getting the film made?\n\nJF: As the associate producer I didn't have much creative input. ADI put together this incredible movie. The part I got to play was that of consultant, financer, and cheerleader.\n\nI'm a very small-time producer, but my dream is to help people tell the stories they want to share. I look for topics that are fulfilling: human and animal rights, and environmental issues.\n\nSH: CSI just wrapped its 14th season -- how's it feel to be a part of that?\n\nJF: It's been an amazing magic carpet ride. Never in million years would I have thought we'd still be doing this, but the cast is incredible. There are pros and cons to being the same character for so long, but I love Sara. She lives a very dark life, but it's also very intriguing. She's almost like my alternate ego. Isn't that one of the biggest draws to acting? I never could have been in the secret service or CSI team in real life.\n\nSH:When did you start producing and how did you break into the \"other side\" of the business?\n\nJF: Some years back I was part of Honeypot, a tiny avant-garde theater company in LA, with four other women. But we all started working so much that eventually we disbanded. My first foray into production was a play on Dusty Springfield, so it was an easy shift.\n\nI met the director for How I Became an Elephant at a party and â¦ I wanted to be him. I wanted to be a part of the film. Maybe that's what I look for because it was the same with Lion Ark.\n\nSH: As a producer, how do you use the business aspect within Hollywood to help further your cause?\n\nJF: It's a tricky thing, with films there's always a risk that it's going to be terrible or that no one going to see it. But if they do come out well then you reach so many people spanning different ages, backgrounds, even countries in just 90 minutes. And with that reach comes influence. I know music and movies have influenced me more than anything else in my life.\n\nSH: The NAACP nomination: what would winning this award mean?\n\nJF: The nomination alone garners all the [nominated] films attention and makes it so they will be watched. Especially with the press the films receive.\n\nWith Lion Ark it's easy to think of it as a movie about lions, but people from all over the world came together for this cause. It was amazing to get the attention of the NAACP â they've done so much human rights work over the years. Really, there's almost no animal issue that isn't connected to the environment and human rights issues. For us, the greatest gift is to be nominated. We're the long shot, but we're incredibly excited to be here.\n\nSH: Being a woman do you ever feel like you have to worker harder to get your message and your work out there?\n\nJF: I'm really lucky because I haven't personally experienced this yet. But then the odds of making any money from documentaries are small.&nbsp; I'll have to let you know once or if I slide into the profit range\n\nI do know that women/actresses still make less then men. Any great movie or television show has four to five roles for guys, and only one for women (and it's usually not as interesting). Fortunately, it's never held me back. As a producer I've worked with men and women and been respected and appreciated.\n\nI owe a lot of it to my parents and my father was an amazing male role model. They always told me I could do whatever I wanted when I grew up as long as I worked hard. As a producer I'm just getting started. I'm excited to see what the next five years will bring.\n\n",

For years, it was television's #1 drama; it reinvented the television form, bringing a previously-unseen cinematic approach to shooting action in its Chicago hospital setting. And it had one of the deepest, craziest, most lovable ensembles in the history of television, both helped and eventually done in by its excessive longevity. There are so many characters in the history of \"ER\" that of course it'd be impossible to rank them all in any kind of definitive way. What's that? Someone's done it? He must have been mad to approach such a task single-handedly.

        "content": "\nFOR THE LAST 14 YEARS, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING JORJA FOX ON OUR TELEVISION SETS. HERE'S A LOOK AT HOW THE ACTOR SPENDS HER TIME OFF SCREEN, AND WHY SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF ONE LUCKY LADY.\n\nJorja Fox is really the antithesis of her television alter ego Sarah Sidle on the hit show CSI. Whereas Sidle is often sullen and dark, Fox is all smiles and has a bounce in her step that just makes you want to be around her. However both ladies are looking for ways to reinvent themselves. \"Sara got dumped by her husband last year so she's been grieving,\" says Fox of the character she's played in close to 300 episodes. \"She's looking for ways to break out of her shell. I think we've all been through a break-up; it's part of the peaks and valleys in life.\"\n\nHoping to step outside of her own comfort zone and reinvent herself again, Fox has taken on the role of producer with the animal rescue documentary Lion Ark. The film reveals a historical move of 25 lions from Libya to a wildlife sanctuary in Colorado. \"I think it's important to reinvent yourself over the years,\" says Fox. \"I'll act for as long as people will have me, however I also want to put my eggs in a couple other baskets.\"\n\nVEGAN WANNABE\n\nOne area Fox won't be reinventing herself is her diet. The actor has been a disciplined vegetarian for the past 20 years. \"Eating meat-free is second nature to me,\" she says. Fox describes herself as a vegan wannabe. \"I'm vegan 85 per cent of the time.\"\n\nFox eats healthy and considers rice pasta with vegan meatloaf her comfort dish. \"I made a vegan meatloaf a couple months ago. Unfortunately I blew it &mdash; it came out looking like chili,\" she laughs. \"It was tasty though.\"\n\nFox does make minor adjustments to her diet in an attempt to improve her health. For example, she switched from early morning coffee to green or black tea. Aware that omega-3 fatty acids are important to her well being, Fox now takes a vegan source of omega-3s daily. She also supplements with a multi, pro-biotic and magnesium and calcium vegetarian capsule.\n\nEarly morning before heading out to work or surf, Fox has a green smoothie. \"Kale, lettuce, spinach, chard, a little fruit, and nuts for protein such as walnuts, almonds or cashews, flaxseed or chia seeds.\" She also eats a sweet something for breakfast. \"A cookie, cupcake, piece of cake &mdash; real sweet. It probably started with me having chocolate pop tarts when I was a kid,\" she says. Growing up in Melbourne Beach, Florida, the young girl never wanted to eat breakfast. \"My mother would feed me almost anything so I didn't go to school on an empty stomach,\" she says. \"Maybe that's why I was a chubby kid.\"\n\nWhen Fox turned 13, she decided she didn't want to be heavy anymore so she became very focused on how to have a healthier weight. Several years later, she won a modeling contents (yet to this day she still considers that a fluke).\n\n\"I think I'll always feel a bit like a fish out of water,\" she says, \"I felt like one in Florida my whole life. I'm quite tall [five-foot-nine] and wouldn't trade that for anything, however there's a sort of awkwardness that comes with it. I was never typically what most people think of as attractive or beautiful in Florida &mdash; I wasn't blonde or curvy.\"\n\nWhile she may still feel atypical at times, Fox can confidently say that she feels a certain comfort in her own skin now. \"I love the California lifestyle of shorts, sun dresses and surfing so I'm on the beach in a bathing suit. Then it's my black wet suit, which reveals all my imperfections. Yeah, I look like a total dork in the water on my surfboard with zinc on my face, and a hat, but I'd rather have the fun experience of surfing.\"\n\nAN OUTDOOR GIRL\n\nIt isn't just surfing Fox loves, she's an outdoor girl. Seizing upon Los Angeles' temperate climate, Fox takes her exercise routine to the open air. With her rescue dog Bear by her site, Fox taks 45-minute walks every day &mdash; sometimes longer on weekends.\n\nI developed a passion for being outside, so hiking, walking and surfing are year-round activities for me. Growing up in Florida, it was all about the ocean. As a younger person, I surfed for the adrenaline rush. As I'm getting older, I'm not into that anymore, however I really like the Zen thing of surfing &mdash; clearing my mind and just being in the moment.\"\n\nFox also hits the outdoors when she's in Canada. Both of her parents were born in Montreal, Quebec and she still has family scattered throughout the country. \"One of my brothers is an avid sailor so we go sailing a lot together up north,\" says Fox, who also loves to swim in the lakes. \"We also have some skiers in the family so that's always a fun visit in the winter months.\"\n\nFASHION BLUES\n\nFox says she has a love an appreciation for fashion, however she appreciates it on other people. \"My parents were of that Mad Men generation, dressed to the nines every day of their life, loved fashion and they got this little girl who just wanted to be barefoot in shorts and a tank top all the time.\" If she feels the need to present herself in a certain light, \"sort of like I'm mature, perhaps intellectual. I always go for dark blue, yet I love the blue tropical ocean color within the turquoise family.\"\n\nSOUL MUSIC\n\n\"I'd put my music into a category of guilty indulgence,\" says Fox. \"Music is something I have never pursued professionally so it's an art form that I can be as silly and crazy as I want to and never worry about it being popular. That has saved me so many times &mdash; having music, which is just for me or just for me and friends &mdash; that's fun.\"\n\n\"I think as actors we sometimes forget to have an artistic hobby,\" says Fox who has played the guitar since age 12. \"Music is more my story.\" If she were to write a tune about her life, what would the title be?\n\n\"Lady Luck. I know it's been used before, but that's what I'd title my song.\" Nor Georgia On My Mind? \"I've heard that thousands of time, especially growing up in the South. It's a song I love and I don't think I'd ever get tired of hearing it.\" Still, with Fox's success and a peaceful existence, Lady Luck seems more fitting.\n\n",

        "content": "\n\"'Catch up with the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation star, find out her favorite places in Los Angeles and more.\"'\n\nDisclaimer: Jorja Fox's is not a typical success story. The CSI: Crime Scene Investigation staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn't in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt. Today, Fox is diving back into a 15th season on CSI as forensic scientist Sara Sidle, and sharing with us her favorite L.A. spots. Listen in.\n\nYou've been playing the role of Sara on *CSI* for 14 years. Do you ever think about the show coming to an end?\n\nEvery year we think about it a little bit. Most shows are picked up one season at a time, so there's always a moment where you think, âThis could be it.' And if it is, then wow, what an amazing ride we've had. CSI grounds me, and I'm so grateful for the work that Sara gets to do. Maybe if we went on for another 14 years I might get tired, but so far, so good! [Laughs] I'll be there.\n\nYou've starred on three of the most popular dramas in the history of TV--*ER*, *The West Wing* and *CSI*. Who's your favorite leading man from each show?\n\nUh-oh! [Laughs] I've been fortunate to work with so many amazing leading men. First is Noah Wyle from ER. He's amazingly charming, shy and an incredibly intelligent guy. On The West Wing, I'm going with DulÃ© Hill. He'd break into dance at any given time during filming. I really enjoyed that, and him! For CSI, I'll say Eric Szmanda, who plays Sanders. Eric was barely legal when he first started on the show.\n\nYou also appeared on the historic coming-out episode of Ellen. Did you realize the importance of that moment at the time?\n\n[Back then,] it was a really big deal, and it was a really, really big deal for Ellen [DeGeneres]. I think I was asked to do it because my character on ER was a lesbian. It was a moment in my life that I was really proud to be a part of, and it has been so great to see Ellen be even more huge now.\n\nIn honor of our arts and culture issue, what are your favorite places to see live music?\n\nI love the Greek Theatre. It's open, it's intimate, and the sound is really good. I love the Disney Concert Hall. The sound is legendary. For smaller venues, I love the Hotel Cafe and Satellite. [They book] bands that are just sort of entering the scene.\n\nAnd I hear you're quite the budding musician!\n\nBut I have no natural talent! I've played guitar on and off since I was 14, and I took up the drums five years ago, but I'm terrible! I'll practice, but I honestly thought I was tone-deaf for a long time. I'm not, I'm just really bad. But I love it, and I'll [play] with friends every once in a while on a Friday night. Thank goodness I'm not trying to actually make a living at it.\n\nDescribe your perfect day.\n\nI'd have breakfast at Sage on the Silver Lake/Echo Park border. It's a plant-based restaurant, and they have amazing smoothies and green drinks. They have this great ice cream counter and all the flavors technically are vegan. Then I would head to Descanso Gardens. I love to go seasonally because it's filled with native flowers. And the Theodore Payne Nursery, which sells native and indigenous plants to California. I love the Ace Hotel downtown for cocktails after dark. The bar is beautiful. I also love to go to the downtown Standard for drinks up on the roof. They have a beautiful view. There's also a restaurant called The Must with a whole bunch of comfort food. They have a ton of vegetarian options and great wine. It's a little off the beaten path. When it comes to shopping, I love going to the [local] surf shop or REI. I also love to hike, and I love Commonwealth near Griffith Park. Once you get to the top, there are trails that go for hours. You can connect yourself to the Hollywood sign. There's parking and it's dog-friendly, too.\n\n[...]",

        "content": "\nIt is hard to believe the \" CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" writers specifically meant for an episode surrounding panic around an Ebola-like virus to land on the schedule exactly when Ebola panic has permeated the US consciousness at yet to be matched levels of cable news attention. Even so, with multiple references to Ebola in the first fifteen minutes alone, the comparisons are too timely and specific to be a complete coincidence. \n\nThis week's episode \"Bad Blood\" (Oct. 12) centers around the death of a former viral researcher and doctor found in his home by Sara and Greg. A bullet to the head after a long battle with the unknown illness originally masks the cause of death, exposing the two investigators to a disease with an 80% mortality rate and no know cure. \n\nThe way the show embraces the panic and rural outbreaks of Ebola is part shameless co-opting of a real problem for drama's sake and part easy promotion for the veteran show. Much of the episode is a Mad Libs version of any contagion movie or show, but mines some emotional material from the case that it rarely gets to do outside of a season finale. \n\nGreg's video call to his grandmother is sweet, but it is he and Sara's conversation that spurs the call that gets at the heart of why the connections between the CSI's are still so potent after so many years on the air. Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda are entwined in the fabric of the show, and their mutual reflection on what they've left unfinished in life is poignant in a way that many procedurals are unable to reach in such a true way. As the final scene proves it may be obvious that these team members love each other, but it is nice for the show to remind everyone of such every now and then. \n\nTed Danson is at his best when he is in \"protect the team\" mode, and even though he takes part in minimal field work this episode he has the chance to take a bite out of suspects when they stand between Russell's investigation and the team's safety. \n\nIn all likelihood, \"CSI\" wouldn't stage a major outbreak before the case is solved or kill Sara off without promoting Jorja Fox's sendoff day and night for a month, and in fact the outcome is obvious from early on. Even so, there are enough suspense-filled and relationship-building moments that they more than outweigh the lack of surprising developments in the case. \n\n\"CSI:Crime Scene Investigation\" airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on CBS.  \n",

If they’d said, “Why don’t you do a wrap-up over several episodes?” we’d’ve done something different. But they sort of just sprang it on us after they canceled the show. They said, “Do you want to say goodbye?” And it was, like, “How do you do that?” We had to write it in six weeks and shoot it in four and then put it on the air. It was a cram job to get it done.\n\nBut they had asked me, “What do you think Grissom’s been doing?” And I said, “Well, I think he’s in the ocean. I think he’s sick of dead bodies and bugs, and he wants to save fish.” So we put that together, and then they said, “Well, what are we going to do about you and Sara? The fans are desperate for you to deal with that.” So I said, “Well, just let ’em sail off into the sunset!” [Laughs.] I mean, if that’s what they want, why at this point would we care? Give ’em what they want! And I just thought it was sort of nice, in that we’d tried to stay away from that stuff all along. We even tried at the end to just keep it as simple as possible: off they go onto the boat. So I was good with it. I just hope that the fans, the people who watched it, were happy about it.",

When the lookalike's car explodes, Brass catches on fire, but once he's extinguished by a fast-acting Sara, he stands there like a total bad-ass, proving once again that the former captain's cajones are made of â¦ well, brass.\n\nGil's in Vegas, sees his ex-wife Sara (#Awkward), and runs into a chipper redhead who flummoxes him to no end. Gil acts like an old, confused man.\n\n[...]\n\nLady Heather is older, and I still want to slap her smug mug SOoooo hard, which is a testament to the sexy, complex and challenging character that actress Melinda Clarke has played intermittently throughout the series.\n\nSara still hates Lady Heather. Me too. I'm totally #TeamSara.\n\n[...]\n\nSara and Gil are divorced, but Sara still loves the bug-loving lug. And finally, we get to see Gil talk to some bugs, because it's just not a Gil-centric episode if we don't' get to see him 1) Talk to bugs, 2) use the Latin name for a bug, 3) turn his head quizzically and look at something/ someone. Ding! Ding! Ding! Three for three! Bonus: Gil got to wear lots of goofy looking-hats in this episode. And, he seemingly trained bees in a matter of minutes, like the bug-whisperer he's always been.\n\nThe bees tell Gil where the murder is (in a scary, yet technologically awesome, shack!). Lo and behold! It's the Green Mile guy. Called it. He's got a bomb vest, and he's set up a bunch of bombs in a Las Vegas parking structure; requiring Catherine, Greg and Morgan to do some fancy wire-cutting. And even though she's been on the show since Season 11, when she was in a L.A/Las Vegas crossover episode, Morgan's hands still have the shakes. Once they're not dead, Morgan and Greg hug and I hope for a moment that they'll make out, because when has Greg ever gotten any action? He's always been in friend zone.\n\nGil convinces the mad bomber/ murderer not to blow himself up, because he deduces that the bomb vest isn't even activated. Murder man hates Gil because he blames Gil for Lady Heather leaving her role as a dom, and then stopping the boning her therapy patients, and then stopping her psychiatry practice altogether. Guy really loves his Lady Heather time. Gil tells a story about a whale whose mate can't hear his song, which makes no sense even though I think it's supposed to be about the man's unrequited love for LH, but is sad, nonetheless.\n\nCatherine wants out of the FBI and wants to gank the Director's job that Sara wants. What mom doesn't want to be her daughter's boss?\n\nGil wraps everything up with Lady Heather (I don't care if she's a doctor, she'll always be a dominatrix to me) and he thanks her for making able to love someone like Sara. It's sweet, but he's also giving her some police procedural info, which makes me scratch my head: Why are they letting the consultant run the case?\n\nBut Sara gets the director's position, and even takes photos with her new badge so that'll be #Awkward due to Catherine's conversation of about 20 seconds ago.\n\nAnd for a few seconds, you think that the Sara and Gil ship has sailed, but with a gentle nudge from newbie Lindsay, Sara watches Lady Heather's statement interview with Gil where he admits his love for Miss Sidle. Suddenly, Sara arrives at Gil's San Diego boat dock in a taxi, because clearly Sara's rather call a cab than ask her longtime pak Nick Stokes for a ride. (Another missed chance for George Eads to do something in this ep.). Gil is wearing yet-another hat, this time it's one that he stole from Ernest Hemmingway. Sarah boards Gil's ship and when they embrace, you know that it'll be Gil + Sara forever. While they sail away from San Diego, I can't help wonder why Sara brought only her small messenger bag with her, and I hope they didn't run that picture of her shaking hands with the commish in the newspaper because she's gone. I guess Catherine gets the job as CSI director by default. Because really, with Sara gone, it's the inmates running the asylum with Morgan, Greg and Hodges (and now newbie Lindsay) left in the department.\n\n[...]\n\n",

It's a frame job, and when the real terrorist shows up--he's played by frequent baddie Doug Hutchinson--we know immediately where the episode is going. Regardless, it doesn't matter, as this was an episode about bringing together the original team and sending them off in a way that pleased fans who showed up earlier in the show's run as well as the fans who stuck around for the series over the long term. \n\nAlthough Ted Danson and the new players--minus Elisabeth Shue and George Eads' characters--are players in the new episode, it really is an episode that is about the original characters, many of whom left at some point but came back for the movie. Willows, Grissom and Sidle get the most screentime (there's even a bees-oriented scene!). And when Lady Heather eventually does show up, she helps with the case but also helps the tension between Grissom and Sidle to subside.\n\nWhich leads us to the lovely final few minutes of the series, when Grissom tells the bomber that he understands bombs as much as he understands oceans, talking to the criminal about a whale and comparing the whale to the bomber's ultimate love for Lady Heather. Catherine Willows decides to put her 'hat in the ring' for a director's position, and D.B. Russell packed up and got ready to go. While we got closure for many of the main characters, the best moment was when Sara decided to come with him on his boat to try a relationship again.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nDEADLINE: Let's start with the final scene of Gil and Sara sailing off into the sunset. How did that ending come about?\n\nZUIKER: SixteenÂ years ago, William Petersen, (executive producers) Cindy Chvatal and Jonathan Littman and myself sat down at the Beverly Wilshire, that was the first time we got together.Â We actually met there 16 years later, same table, same party of four. And William Peterson pulled out this research folder that dealt with sea shepherd. This is a gentleman that goes along the ocean and does things in terms of keeping the ocean safe. That was the beginning of me thinking of the Gil Grissom's character being a CSI at sea. We knew we wanted to start with him on a boat. Then we started to think about ending with him on the boat. And it just organically happened. Once he'd gotten in touch with his heart and when he really understood that Sara was the only person for him, it was only fitting as a closure for the series that Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle would drive off into the sunset.\n\nDEADLINE: Was there any alternativeÂ endingÂ you considered?\n\nZUIKER: No, there wasn't. We knew right away that if we were going to grab (Gil) on a boat to start his arc it only was fitting to end there. The one thing that wasn't planned, it hit me during the running, was them actually driving off into the sunset,Â only this time it was on water. The metaphor of them driving off into the sunset happened in the moment.\n\nDEADLINE: The Gil-Sara romance has been aÂ very popular storyline for many seasons but also divided some fans. Why did you make it the centerpiece of the finale? Did you always know that the two of them would end up together or you did it for the fans?\n\nZUIKER: This one really was for the fans. I'd put some feelers out early on Twitter about what were some things the hardcore Twitttersphere wanted to accomplish. And overwhelmingly it really was a sufficient closure between Grissom and Sara. We knew that we would be going that route. We had to complicate that fantasy, and that was the reason to put Lady Heather in the middle because she suddenly became this other option that Grissom had been wrangling with over the course of many seasons, much to the point where a lot of the audience was convinced, and maybe even Grissom himself, that Lady Heather is the one that actually has his heart. As it turns out, Grissom has to make a choice by the end of the show, and I think the audience would be happy he chooses SaraÂ and we finally put them together.\n\n[...]\n\nDEADLINE: If there is a CSI: 10 Years Later special a decade from now, where will we see the main characters? Will Gil and Sara still be roaming the seas?\n\nZUIKER: I believe so. I believe in my heart 10 years from now that Grissom and Sara not only are conquering the seas and sailing the oceans but they are also probably saving the environment on land and sea. They would probably have children and they would dedicate their lives to the betterment of humanity. In terms of the other characters, probably Catherine would still be running the crime lab, Bass probably would retire, living somewhere in Hawaii, and DB probably is working in the private sector in Washington DC. And I think that all these characters would still have their toe in the crime water.\n\n[...]  \n",

I just kind of grew up and apart from the show, just as the original characters grew apart from each other (looking at you, Grissom and Sara). \n\nSo, tonight's two-hour finale, which reunited Gil Grissom (\"'William Petersen\"'), Sara Sidle (\"'Jorja Fox\"'), Catherine Willows (\"'Marg Helgenberger\"'), Jim Brass (\"'Paul Guilfoyle\"'), David Hodges (\"Wallace Langham\"), the aforementioned Greg, and even Grissom's ridiculous dominatrix friend/foe Lady Heather (\"'Melinda Clarke\"'), felt like a trip back to my teen years in a way I should have expected but totally didn't.\n\nIt was like no time had passed at all, both for me and for the show. In fact, I'm pretty sure I have social studies homework due tomorrow, and that I should go to bed (as soon as I'm finished updating my LiveJournal with all my Grissom/Sara thoughts). \n\n[...]\n\nThe emotional through-line of the finale was obviously Sara and Grissom reuniting since getting divorced however long ago that was. They both ended up admitting separately to Lady Heather that they were still in love with each other, but it took Lindsey hinting to Sara that she should watch Grissom's interrogation of Lady Heather for her to get that. In the end, she and Grissom sailed off into the sunset on his little boat, which is just as things should be.\n\n[...]\n\nFrom a fan standpoint, I loved everything about everything that I just saw. \n\nIf I'm looking at the episode with a more critical eye, that was totally and completely ridiculous. Obviously, the bomber was Doug Hutchison. Obviously, Sara and Grissom were destined to be together again. Obviously, all bombs (and there were a lot of bombs) that endangered anyone we cared about were diffused at the very last second. Obviously, bees. \n\n[...]\n\n",

Zuiker; co-creators and executive producers Ann Donahue and Carol Mendelsohn; executive producers Jonathan Littman and Jerry Bruckheimer; William Petersen (Gil Grissom), who returns for the finale after having left the show; Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle); Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), who returns for the finale; Ted Danson (D.B. Russell); Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders); Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Jim Brass), who returns for the finale; Robert David Hall (Dr. Al Robbins); Jon Wellner (Henry Andrews); David Berman (David Phillips); Wallace Langham (David Hodges); and Elisabeth Harnois (Morgan Brody).\n\nHere are five things we learned at the lively goodbye panel.\n\n[...]\n\n2. This cast really loves each other â¦\n\nRice asked the cast to go in a circle and each share their first impression of the person sitting to their right. Their answers ranged from sincere to sarcastic, but all spoke with deep affection for the people sitting around them. Danson called Helgenberger 'the most elegant, gracious, and welcoming lady that I've worked with' before Helgenberger told Petersen, 'I can't imagine taking this ride with anybody else.'\n\nFox said to Guilfoyle, completely seriously, 'You have this New York sensibility, and this wit, and [you're] down-to-earth, and you took risks, and you were just so classy, and kind of Austin Powers.' Guilfoyle broke the rules and replied to her, calling Fox 'the heart of this whole group.' Berman revealed that he officiated Wellner's wedding and threw his bachelor party, adding, 'To get to work with my best friend every single day is pretty amazing.' Wellner paid it forward to Szmanda: 'He's so dreamy!'\n\n3. â¦ except Jorja Fox and William Petersen -- at first\n\nFox sat to Petersen's right, and when his turn came to recall their first meeting, he turned to her and said, 'Did we meet at lunch?' Rather than answering the question, Fox replied, 'You drove me crazy.' For the first how many months? 'Like six. And then, I don't know â¦ I realized we were kind of stuck together.'\n\nPetersen was not evidently bothered by Fox's admission. He fondly recollected their first lunch together and said, 'Every time I was able to do a scene with you, it was like falling off a log. I think that Grissom fell for you because you got him. And you got me, too.' The audience aww-ed, and Fox amended, 'I adore you so much.'\n\n[...]  \n",

At one point in the finale, a mysterious bad guy sends in a face-scrambling video message straight to Grissom: 'The grand finale is specifically designed for you.' That vibed like a meta mission statement for 'Immortality,' which worked best as an extremely melodramatic triangle between Grissom, longtime antagonist/ambiguous love interest Lady Heather, and even-longer-time ally/ex-wife Sara.\n\nNo, but really, at a certain point in the second hour, 'Immortality' went full soap, with Heather and Sara interrogating each other vis-Ã -vis Grissom:\n\n:\"'Heather\"': 'You're scared for him.'  \n:\"'Sara\"': 'I am.'  \n:\"'Heather\"': 'Do you love him?'  \n:\"'Sara\"': 'I do.'  \n:\"'Heather\"': 'I believe you.'  \n:\"'Sara\"': 'You should. Do you?'  \n:\"'Heather\"': 'Do I what?'  \n:\"'Sara\"': 'Love him.'  \n:\"'Heather\"': 'â¦No.'\n\n[...]\n\nDon't believe me? When it turned out the bad guy was Doug Hutchinson all along, he blamed all his actions on Grissom -- because Grissom stole Lady Heather's heart. I quote directly: ''You came along, and you turned her heart. \"She quit role-playing because of you. SHE QUIT HER PRACTICE BECAUSE OF YOU. SHE QUIT MEâ¦ BECAUSE OF YOU!!!\"'\n\nThis led Grissom to give a good long speech about the 52-Hertz Whale, a lovelorn semi-mythic mega-creature who sings a love song at a frequency far too low for a lady whale to ever hear him. Grissom was the whale, kind of -- for the finale of a show set in a landlocked desert town, there was a lot of ocean imagery in 'Immortality.'\n\nIn the end, Willows declared that she wanted to come back to Las Vegas, to take care of her casino and some orphan children and her daughter, the rookie CSI. And Sara got to take over as director of the CSI program. 'Vegas is lucky to have you,' said Grissom. 'The oceans are lucky to have you,' said Sara.\n\nThe show ended with Sara and Grissom together, boating off into the distance. 'Immortality' tied that finale into some larger notion of the show as Grissom's rehumanization. 'I'd lost my belief in humanityâ¦ she restores my faith in the human being.' Thus, all of \"CSI\" was the story of a man of science, learning to become a man of faith. Or something.\n\n[...]\n\n",

The creators, producers, and cast met up on closing night of this year's PaleyFest Fall TV Preview for a farewell salute panel on Wednesday (moderated by EW's own Lynette Rice), and we caught up with William Petersen and some of his costars on the red carpet before the event to get their thoughts about the end of \"CSI\". \n\n[...]\n\nAs \"CSI\" investigates its last grisly crime on TV and Petersen comes back for one final appearance, fans are wondering how the finale will address Grissom's romance with Jorja Fox's character Sara Sidle.\n\n'Well, we do see each other again,' Petersen teases vaguely. 'And talk to each other -- as best we can, because we're not very good at that.' But that's all he would say. 'It's really a secret!'\n\n[...]  \n",

The show that launched the colossal franchise on CBS -- as well as career aspirations for forensics obsessives everywhere -- concludes Sunday with a two-hour finale.\n\nFortunately, Fox has other passions, including outdoor exercise and her environmentally conscious vegetarian diet.\n\nWith \"CSI\" wrapping up after so many years, will you have more time to surf and dedicate to fitness?\n\nI sure hope so. I've been surfing regularly since we wrapped production. I gave myself a few weeks to decompress and enjoy the end of summer, and I'm already considerably fitter than I was when we shot the finale. I hope I can stay this way.\n\nWhat are you most excited about moving on to next?\n\nI helped produce three documentary films through my company Seafox Productions these last few years, and I'd like to continue making documentaries. It's been a very rewarding experience.\n\nI'm most excited about not knowing what I am going to do next or where I am going to land. I can count the ways I'm not going to miss \"CSI\" on one hand. I won't miss the early calls, the late nights, the extreme heat, the extreme cold or the plastic vest I've worn for more than 10 years. Other than that, I'm going to miss everything about \"CSI,\" but I've always enjoyed not knowing exactly where the road leads.\n\nHow did you get involved with documentary films?\n\nAbout 10 years ago I attended a small dinner party where most of the guests got into a big discussion, which turned into an hourlong argument. I opted to stay out of the heated discussion and began talking with the man sitting next me, who told me all about a film he was making. I knew within the first 10 minutes that I wanted to be a part of his project and asked how I could help. That's how our film, \"How I Became an Elephant,\" began. I love to tell stories, and I love to give others a platform to share their stories.\n\nHow do your passions for surfing and vegetarianism help inform the type of projects you've produced?\n\nMy passion and love for planet Earth and its creatures informs my surfing, my vegetarianism and the documentaries I produce. I love to be outside; I literally grew up in the ocean and am constantly thinking about when I can get back into the water. I have a boundless interest and love for the natural world.\n\nDo you have any favorite veg-friendly restaurants and food businesses here?\n\nI love Native Foods and Veggie Grill for a quick meal. As for a sit-down meal, I love Crossroads Kitchen, Sage Bistro, Mohawk Bend, Shojin Vegan Sushi and Vegan Gold and Vegan Glory.  \n",

She could not have been more wrong. The drama about a forensics investigation division in Las Vegas was an instant smash.\n\nDuring its 15-year run, \"CSI\" spawned three spinoffs and became one of TV's most popular series, in the U.S. and internationally. \n\nLike other cast member, Fox, who played investigator Sara Sidle, was extremely appreciative that the show was given a final bow: \"It was such a great gift. I was thrilled. And the finale was truly a love letter to our fans.\"\n\nFox added that working again with William Petersen, who played investigator Gil Grissom, and Marg Helgenberger, who played Catherine Willows, was exciting. \"Us all being back together felt like the most natural thing in the world. It was such a joy to have them.\"\n\nOne of the main attractions for fans of the series was the romance between Grissom and Sidle. And the finale featured them in a tough situation. After getting married years ago, things started to go wrong and they divorced.\n\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour   \nA fatal explosion in a casino brings the retired Grissom back to Vegas, where he has a tense reunion with his ex.\n\n\"My character is really thinking, 'How can I work with him again?' and it's pretty awkward,\" Fox said. \"It's uncomfortable and messy.\"\n\nHowever, by the end of the episode, the two discover that they are still in love with each other.\n\nSaid Fox: \"I always knew I was part of this weird love story. For all the violence and darkness in the show, there's still this love story, and that's such a terrific way to end up. No matter how black things seem, 'CSI' is a love story; there is long and lasting love.\"\n\nThe couple is seen at the end literally riding off into the sunset, where Grissom has relocated. But there's still the matter of Sidle's job in Las Vegas, where she's been promoted to the head of the CSI unit. The future of Grissom and Sidle is still a mystery as the credits close. \n\n\"On one hand, maybe they'll just ride around in the boat for an hour and then call it quits,\" Fox said with a chuckle. \"Or maybe they'll stay together and become CSIs for the ocean and the environment. There's no talk of a spinoff, but that would make a great idea for a show.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Fox is looking forward to the next chapter of her life and career.\n\n\"I have no idea what's next,\" Fox said. \"In some ways, the end of the show caught me by surprise. It's the first time in 19 years I've been between jobs. I'm just going to decompress a little bit. It's been nice just hanging out with my dog and just letting go. I can't wait to see what the next thing is.\"  \n",

        "content": "\nIn the end, 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation' died as it lived: fun, flabby, and altogether too invested in the undying love of two deeply sexless characters. \n\n[...]\n\nThough Petersen's return for the series finale gave the show a badly needed jolt of original 'CSI' magic, it also meant that the love story of Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle returned to center stage.\n\nSidle, played by Jorja Fox, was another of the show's originating characters. She initially was Grissom's subordinate but eventually became friend, lover, wife, estranged wife, ex-wife &#8212; in the most uninteresting ways possible. Fox and Petersen always existed within the show's universe without an ounce of chemistry, so when the series opted to make the two its 'one true pairing,' it went all in on the show's least interesting relationship.\n\nSadly, there was plenty of Grissom-and-Sidle relationship drama in the finale, as we quickly learn that the two have divorced and it becomes clear, when Grissom returns to Las Vegas to help investigate a string of suicide bombings, that they are still in love with each other. It's this misguided commitment to its own worst tendencies that made 'Immortality, Parts 1 and 2' such a fitting sendoff for 'CSI.'\n\nThough the show finally had the luminous Helgenberger back as Catherine Willows, it trapped her in a one-dimensional storyline that underlined how the series only knew how to view the character through the fact that she was a mother.\n\nEven worse than the investment in Grissom and Sidle is the fact that the show brought back Lady Heather, a popular recurring character, played by Melinda Clarke, who had a deep and complex relationship with Grissom, who, despite having the entire plot seemingly revolve around her, functions only as a red herring, only useful to drive Sidle and Grissom back together. \n\n[...]\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious misstep the finale makes is in its conclusion when, after finally taking over as CSI director, Sidle leaves the career she's built to wander around the oceans with Grissom. True love is one thing; it's two people meeting in the middle and each giving ground so they can find a place where they can each thrive. But that's not what 'CSI' does. It breaks Sara's back and sends her on her way, and the implication is clear: If her relationship only works by following Grissom to the ends of the Earth, then her true calling is following Grissom to the ends of the Earth.\n\nIt's a weird and contrary message, the opposite of what love is, and, in a way, the perfect summation of a relationship that never really worked. Sidle and Grissom sail off into the sunset, something the show believes is a happy ending but reality makes less clear.\n\n[...]\n\n",

It will serve as a kind of memory book, with original lead investigators Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) returning to the fold.\n\nThey will join the current team, led for the last four years by D.B. Russell (Ted Danson), to help stop one last batch of ultra-bad guys with the tools of their trade: microscopes, DNA evidence, analytic computer programs and other impressive high-tech stuff.\n\n'We can't close every open storyline from 15 years,' says Jorja Fox, who has played investigator Sara Sidle for the whole run. 'But the last show is absolutely a love letter to our fans. It's something I'm pretty sure everyone will enjoy.\n\n'It's so unusual in television to get everyone back together like this.'\n\nBut then, 'CSI' has always been deceptively unusual.\n\n[...]\n\nReal-life forensic scientists have cautioned that some of the techniques and equipment shown on 'CSI' are futuristic. Fox suggests its larger premise of scientific analysis is what has resonated with viewers.\n\n'Forensics has evolved just over the time we've been doing the show,' she notes. 'Every season we'd get a couple of new gadgets and gizmos. I think one reason we lasted as long as we did was that forensic evaluation felt realistic.'\n\n'CSI' didn't just run on fingernail scrapings, of course. The characters all had their personal dramas, from Grissom's hearing disorder to his affair with Sara.\n\n'In 15 years my job never got boring,' says Fox. 'There was an arc to Sara's life, though I never would have seen it when we started. This kind of run is something you never expect, for 'CSI' or any other television show.'\n\nThe 47-year-old Fox recalls that in the first couple of seasons, 'CSI' was considered groundbreaking enough that 'some people wished we could be on cable, so we could get into more gritty things.'\n\nLooking back, she says she's fine with the show staying right where it was - and not just because broadcast standards gradually did allow it to show a little more grit.\n\n'If we were on cable, I'd probably have to be doing some scenes naked,' she says, laughing. 'And I'm getting a little long in the tooth for that.'\n\nThe return of Grissom in Sunday's finale does bring Sara and Gus together one more time, which perhaps will help suggest where their characters might head in the future.\n\nFox says she isn't sure exactly where that will be, but that after playing Sara for 15 years, 'I think I probably see her future more clearly than I see my own.'\n\nIn the broader picture, 'CSI' has simply helped move television police work into a new era.\n\n[...]\n\nIn the 'CSI' world, the perp could sit sneering somewhere, confident he or she had gotten away with it, while the 'CSI' team was painstakingly examining everything this side of dust bunnies to nail him or her anyhow.\n\n'If 'CSI' could just help people understand the value of science,' says Fox, 'that would be a good thing.'\n\nIt's also not a bad thing that for many years it simultaneously succeeded as television entertainment.\n\n[...]  \n",

Petersen's return was a reminder that \"CSI\" had never been the same since Grissom left.\n\nAn oft-repeated promotional spot signaled the ending.

She joined him in the final moments, and they sailed away.\n\n[...]\n\nBut when Grissom faced off against the villain, the bad guy was no match. Grissom paused to talk whale songs, and Petersen sold the unusual moment. The actor had been a chief reason the show took off in the ratings.\n\nThe flashy technology and detail-driven crime stories were others. In the end, the finale highlighted the series' assets that made the \"CSI effect\" part of the culture. The scenes ranged from horrifying (those bombings) to gross (a look at the contents of a cadaver's mouth) to melodramatic (Sara lost it in talking with Lady Heather).\n\nThere was business to conduct: D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) announced he was moving on for another opportunity. He joins \"CSI: Cyber.\"\n\nThe \"CSI\" finale played tricks, too: Grissom came up on a corpse that turned out to be ... synthetic. \"Everyone thinks you're responsible,\" Grissom told Lady Heather of the bombings. \"I am,\" she replied.\n\nBut, of course, she wasn't. Grissom, however, did thank her for opening his heart and making him realize his love for Sara.\n\nNow they live in TV history, sailing away and enjoying a happily-ever-after that will not end.

We never wanted to have a romance. We didn't want to stop the show for that. So what was fun was finding the little ways we could fall for each other.\" \n\n\"The fact that the audience who did love these stories and mysteries would actually care a little bit about the personal lives of these characters was an even more gigantic compliment,\" says Fox, 47, admitting the series \"probably changed my life in every way conceivable â¦.

I certainly wasn't. Grissom was as wonderfully grizzled and nerdy as ever, (Sara) sidling back into the role as if no time whatsoever had passed. As such, it was probably inevitable that he would get the most screen time, but I suppose that's as it should be.\n\nBesides, if they hadn't taken that approach, we wouldn't have gotten what were, by far, the tenderest moments in the entire series between Grissom and Sara (Jorja Fox), culminating in an implied boat ride off into the sunset together, with Sara seemingly forgoing her new job as director to be with him and Catherine stepping up to the plate in her stead, which was a nice touch.\n\nWhile part of me- the more feminist part- was a bit miffed that Sara would give up her plum gig for a guy that was clearly married to his own work, I get it. The show, and perhaps more than a few viewers, wanted these two to ride off- or sail off, as the case was- into the sunset together, and that's what we got. Hey, at least they gave the job to another woman, so there's that.\n\n[...]\n\nI think my favorite moments of the episode were the quieter ones: Sara and Grissom speaking volumes in the silence as they waited for color-coded bees to return; the look on Grissom's face when the 'Syndaver' opened its eyes in that open-aired warehouse, itself a quintessential 'CSI'-type location; the last sighting of those hyper-bright flashlights in the darkness; the other oddball clues, like the thumbprint 'face' D.B.

Good to know, and even better for Sara to know. Definitely a nice touch.\n\n[...]\n\n",

        "content": "\nAfter 15 years and countless cases, *CSI* closes the lab for good with a two-hour send-off.\n\nTHE MOST POPULAR, groundbreaking and influential whodunit in TV history has to go out with a bang, right? CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ends its 15-season run with \"Immortality,\" a two-hour episode about an explosive attack on the Eclipse, the posh Las Vegas casino co-owned by former CSI Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger). This news-making calamity has Catherine, now working for the FBI in Los Angeles, returning to Sin City to lead the forensics investigation. She'll be joined by her old boss, Gil Grissom (William Petersen), who is back to help with the case because he, too, has a personal connection: One of the prime suspects is his former dominatrix love, Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke).\n\n\"It's a privilege to be able to bring real closure to this show &#8212; something that rarely happens when a program gets canceled,\" says creator Anthony Zuiker, who was making eight bucks an hour as a Vegas tram driver when he sold his CSI pilot to CBS. \"Our finale is scary and thrilling and entertaining as hell, but it's also a chance to thank the fans for their undying devotion,\" Zuiker says. \"We want them to feel good about what happens to this family of CSI characters when the show is over. To do that, we've pulled out all the stops.\"\n\nBut first Zuiker took to social media to find out exactly what those loyal fans hoped to see resolved before CSI ends. No surprise there: They rapidly want divorcÃ©es Gil and Sara (Jorja Fox) to get back together. \"Can we please everybody with this finale? Of course not,\" Zuiker teases. \"But will we please most of the people and give them the emotional experience they want? Absolutely.\"\n\nThis last hurrah certainly had Helgenberger in a state. The Emmy-winning actress, who exited CSI in 2012, read the finale script while flying cross-country. \"When I got to the last page and saw the words 'End of series,' I burst into tears,\" she says. \"The flight attendant was very concerned about me. I never would have anticipated such a reaction, but, obviously, this show means a great deal to me. I just had to come back and see it through to the end.\"\n\nCSI stunned us with its crafty crimes and state-of-the-art visuals of slo-mo bullets ripping through organs and chest cavities, but it also shook up the U.S. legal system. Don't believe us? Google \"the CSI effect\"! The series spawned three spinoffs, too, including CSI: Cyber, which returns this fall. \"We made science cool and sexy, and in our heyday, we were pulling nearly 30 million viewers a week,\" Helgenberger says. \"Who does that anymore?\"\n\n",

In some ways, that feels ironic because of the show's insistence early on, partially at Petersen's behest, not to go home with its characters. But Zuiker says the TV landscape has changed, as has the audience's desire for character. \n\n\"Our quote back in the day was, 'We do character in dropperfuls,'\" Zuiker says with a laugh. \"The funny joke of it all is the one thing that wasn't scripted that really turned our series upside down was when Sara Sidle wiped a piece of chalk from drywall off Gil Grissom's face. The second she did that, it was the start of something that got people really interested. We will certainly explore the relationship between Grissom and Sara that started with that conversation and quite possibly build an entire finale around that.\"\n\n[...]",

'We do see each other again, and we talk to each other as best we can,' William Petersen hints, 'because we're not very good at that.'\n\nNot only does Jorja Fox confirm that the couple's long-awaited reunion is 'awkward, because we kind of broke up,' but Melinda Clarke's Lady Heather will complicate things in the finale, considering the dominatrix 'wreaks havoc everywhere she goes.'\n\n[...]\n\n*THE FINAL COUNTDOWN | Fox promises the entire two-hour endeavor is 'absolutely a love letter to our fans,' and Zuiker adds that the episode's final moments will be some of the series' most poignant. 'The last five minutes of this show are as good as anything you'll ever see in TV and cinema,' he teases. 'For the fans, and for the journey of the 16 years we've been doing this, those last five minutes are really, really endearing. It's going to be timeless.'  \n",

Well, you were the voice of reason, saying that you hoped William Petersen would be back for the end. Thankfully, you were right. Although I still think they should not have been separated, the end of the finale was oh so satisfying. Grissom and Sara sailing off into the sunset was a much-welcomed cliché. The finale was good, old-school CSI with lots of throwbacks to the past, and the ending was absolutely beautiful. Nicely done for a show about death. The onscreen magic of Petersen and Jorja Fox will be missed, but the memories now are all good ones. Thanks to the cast and crew, and to Anthony Zuiker, for making it happen. — Jen\n\nMatt Roush: Even if the sailing off into the sunset fadeout was a bit corny, it seemed appropriate, and most important, satisfying to the fans. When wrapping up a show with this much history and baggage, giving the faithful viewer a payoff should be a top priority. (Are you listening, Castle?) If Grissom hadn't come back for the final chapter, it would have been much more disappointing for everyone. So kudos for sure.\n\n[...]",

And what about the return of Lady Heather? Read on for all the answers but beware: Spoilers ahead.\n\n[...]\n\nThe episode was largely dominated by Grissom, which seems only right since the character was the driving force of the show for nine seasons. 'Looks like somebody jumped a shark,' Grissom joked at one point, very tongue-in-cheek. Ted Danson had a handful of scenes, and Elizabeth Shue was killed off rather unceremoniously. Professional dominatrix and fan favorite Lady Heather also had a memorable return, as she was at the center of multiple twists and turns that had viewers buzzing on social media -- even if Jorja Fox's Sara Sidle wasn't in the mood.\n\n[...]\n\nGrissom had a lot of great lines, including a poem: 'Evidence may bear, even if rare,' he said. 'It's what's not there that gives you a scare.' But ultimately a lot of it came down to terrorism, Catherine's box and a lonely 52-Hertz whale. And although some may not love Gil's happy ending that had him and Sara boating off together (many consider their romance as the moment when 'CSI' jumped its own shark), it was a beautiful farewell to a beloved character.\n\nWith 'CSI' gone for good, fans will undoubtedly be sad that they're losing a landmark show that some feared had hung on too long.

Miz Fox isn’t a tabloid superstar or even a gossip glossy regular, and we’d bet the farm she prefers it that way. She is, none-the-less, a veteran staple of the medical drama and police procedural genres. Prominent recurring roles on “ER” and “The West Wing” and a guest turn on “Law &Order” led to a recently ended 15-year run in a pivotal role on the internationally popular “CSI.” Along the way, multi-talented Miz Fox co-founded Honeypot Productions, an experimental theater company in Los Angeles, appeared in the historic 1997 “coming out” episode on “Ellen,” and produced two animal-oriented documentaries (“How I Became and Elephant” and “Lion Ark”). She also produced the short-lived, limited run 2007 one-woman musical in Los Angeles, “Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield,” that years later was remounted in a revised, expanded version Off Broadway as “Forever Dusty.”\n\nProperty records suggest the Silver Lake property was purchased by the gap-toothed former fashion model and staunch vegetarian in May 2004 for $1.2 million, and current listing details show the two-story residence, set high and privately on a street-to-street hillside parcel in a quiet pocket of the still artsy and increasingly pricey community, has a total of five bedrooms and three bathrooms in about 3,600 square feet. For the lazy and/or infirm, it’s two forbidding flights from the street to an inset porch where Miz Fox — or, perhaps, a professional stager — placed a pillow-laden wooden bench where one can take a well-earned breather after the long hike up and/or take in the lovely, over-the-rooftops view the elevated perch allows. It’s one step down from the small — some might call it uncomfortably cramped — pentagram-shaped entrance vestibule to the well-proportioned but far short of gigantic 24-foot-long living room that sports honey-hued narrow-gauge hardwood floors, probably original wood-framed casement windows, a fireplace with red brick surround, ceiling beams dressed up with carved corbels, and a towering arched window that, like the front porch, provides a panoramic view that sweeps over the surrounding rooftops and encompasses the Ivanhoe Reservoir, the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign. The dining room, 17-feet long and far from square with seven sides, links through to a much more traditionally four-walled breakfast room. Black ceramic countertops on the built-in buffet in the breakfast room are repeated in the adjoining galley-style kitchen that features original tile on the walls and backsplashes along with pale and prosaic raised panel wood cabinets and up-to-date, medium-grade stainless steel appliances.\n\nThe three upper-floor bedrooms, each behind an intricately inlaid wood door, open off a double wide and sky-lit, eight-sided corridor that features built-in linen cabinets and built-in desk area. The larger two bedrooms, one with a bay window that looks out to the backyard, both have generous, windowed walk-in closets and share a spacious and restored vintage bathroom. Since we’re an easy sucker for a little bit of authentic patina in a home, this property gossip is pleased to see the original tile work was retained although we admit the flesh color of the tiles isn’t optimal. The smallest of the three bedrooms on the upper floor has a petite walk-in closet and direct access to a small and well-maintained if perfectly ordinary bathroom that also opens off the mud room behind the kitchen. The lower level, the legality of which is to be verified by the buyer according to online marketing materials, comes in at about 1,100 square feet and includes a family room/media lounge with separate exterior entrance and a linear kitchenette with two-drawer dishwasher, refrigerated drawer, and a slender, under-counter wine fridge. Two more bedrooms, one painted deep turquoise with walk-in closet and the other lined with decidedly contemporary built-in wardrobes, share a hall bathroom.\n\nFrom the upper level of the residence one must pass less than elegantly through the mud room to access the walled and terraced backyard where a lower patio has basket weave pattern red brick terracing and an upper level deck, backed by a tall privacy wall and a vine-draped pergola, overlooks a koi pond that waterfalls down to a second koi pond. A detached structure at the upper rear of the property contains a two-car garage and a notably roomy if somewhat inconveniently located laundry room.\n\nOur research suggests Miz Fox has decamped Silver Lake for the western end of the Los Feliz neighborhood where in May 2014 she dropped $2.825 million on an formidably boxy, mid-’70s red-brick contemporary pavilion that opens through an double-height arched colonnade to a stone-tiled plaza and swimming pool and, some persnickety people we know might stamp their feet and complain, looks a tetch more like a Midwestern bank branch than a private residence in Southern California.",

Meanwhile, Catherine investigates a collapse of a building that killed three senior citizens.\n\n Sara Sidle Review## \n\nThe case appears to be a carjacking/murder, but a sudden rain storm threatens to wash away the evidence. Despite what he told her earlier about getting a life outside the lab, Grissom calls Sara in on her day off. Sara runs around taking photos in a frenzy while the rest of the team collects what evidence that they can. Sara and Grissom question the witness, and Sara collects the witness' clothes.\n\nSara brings Grissom personal information on the murdered couple, and wonders why someone would fight to death for a car. At the autopsy (in what is a recurring minor theme), David Phillips smiles at Sara. This time she returns it.\n\nWith Brass, Sara takes the knife tip removed from a body to a shop to determine what type and brand of dagger it is. She also helps Warrick get prints from the car and compares them with the third victim, whom Grissom has just brought in. Nick gets Sara and Warrick to recreate the crime scene, which when they compare their conjecture to the state of the witness' clothes, proves via evidence that the witness is actually the killer; Sara gets mad at herself because she believed the witness' story. Going through the victim's bank records, Sara finds out it was a deliberate double hit.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara likes the drying room, where clothing evidence is kept, because it's 'peaceful and quiet'.  \nSara is 'played' by a suspect, showing a tendency to believe what people tell her at face value.  \nSara doesn't mind when Phillips flirts with her.\n\n Quotes\n\nSalesman: Did you really dig this [knife tip] out of a body?  \nSidle: Yeah, but I washed it for you.  \n\n- -\n\nSalesman: How's a cop know all that [about metal]?   \nSidle: grins He's the cop.

The CSI's track Gauss to a park, following evidence in his apartment, and barely prevent Agent Moore from killing him. In the course of the investigation, the CSIs find that Moore is getting a divorce, his wife is suing for custody of their daughter and Trent, her 18 year-old stepson. Also Trent is a paranoid schizophrenic. Moore omitted all these facts.\n\nGauss is determined to be innocent, however this doesn't stop Moore from trying to kill him. Someone beats Moore to it, and Gauss is shot by Trent Moore, who was in the car when his sister was kidnapped. The CSIs manage to find Trent, but his gun was not used to kill Catherine. After Jim Brass confronts Agent Moore, the father confesses to his son, saying he shot Catherine to prevent her from taking Trent away. Trent saw his father kill Catherine, but thought it was Gauss and ran off with the van. Trent hid his sister in a hotel, and then went to kill Gauss.\n\nThe daughter is perfectly fine, Trent is checked into a mental institution, and Moore is arrested for killing his wife.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara processes the scene at Trent's house and when Agent Moore becomes unmanageable, kicks him out to stop him from contaminating the scene further.\n\nWhen they hunt down Trent, Sara insists on talking to him as he 'connects better' with women.

The criminals are armed with automatic rifles and nine-millimeters, and are firing on the police vehicles from the start. The cops give chase for 20 blocks, one car taking 78 bullets, before the chase went to foot. The rookie cop was shot and killed, and the others take little mercy in hunting down the four criminals. Three are shot and eventually die, while one gets away, shooting a teenager to take his bike.\n\nThe CSIs arrive and split up the scenes. Catherine takes Brass and Sofia's guns, and stays with them for their interview and processing. Grissom and Warrick take the alleys. Nick and Sara take the cars. Greg takes the 20 blocks of chase scene.\n\nBrass gives a fairly clear recount of what happened, staying calm and as coherent as he can. Sofia, on the other hand, is scattered, distracted, and obviously discombobulated. Her story is choppy and she can not clearly remember the entire situation.\n\nNick, who speaks fluent Spanish, is surprised when the locals claim the criminals were shot in the back. Sara, who speaks no Spanish, processes a house shot in the crossfire, and is accosted by a woman who wants to know why this happened near her children. The entire community seems more in arms about the cops treatment of the criminals and the shot (and eventually dead) teenager, than the facts that a police officer is also dead and the criminals had long rap sheets. The mother of one of the dead criminals shouts at Warrick, and her other son punches him, though charges are not pressed.\n\nWhile all this rankles the police, the evidence does not lie, and matters will only get worse as it appears the dead cop was shot by friendly fire.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSeen primarily in the scene with the Spanish speaking mother, Sara is obviously shaken and uneasy when asked to explain how something like this could happen. She has no answer when the daughter translates, asking why someone shot their house. No translation is needed when the mother cries and hugs her children, wanting answers that have no questions.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nIn the conclusion of \"A Bullet Runs Through It (Part 1)\", the detectives and CSI follow the questions of who shot officer Bell, who shot the young boy on his bicycle, and why would a car open fire on a police squad car.\n\nThe criminals opened fire on the cop car to distract them from the car the police had originally intended to pull over. Having seen a man strong-arm a pregnant woman into a car, the police had signaled them to pull over, not knowing they were really trafficking drugs. To get the heat off the drug mules, the other car opened fire and led the police away. One of the shooters died while waiting on an ambulance, while two others were killed at the scene. One died in an alley, having thrown his gun onto a roof, only to have it slide back down into his hand and thus appear armed to the police.\n\nOne shooter got away, and did indeed kill the young boy for his bicycle to get away.\n\nThe final answer is that Jim Brass shot officer Bell. During the fire fight, both men stood up. Bell was hit in the chest, but had on body armor. The shot turned him and Brass, who was shooting across Bell's car (in violation of protocol) accidently hit Bell.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nEarly in the episode, Sofia Curtis comes to unburden herself to Grissom, who repeatedly asks her not to tell him. Sofia is on administrative leave and shouldn't talk to anyone on the force, which is hard since most of her friends are cops, including her mother. As Sofia talks over Grissom's objections, Sara arrives and reinforces Grissom's statement of how Sofia shouldn't be there, talking to them. Sofia spits back that Sara doesn't have many friends outside the force, and Sara offers the name of a police psychologist.\n\nWhile hunting for the bullet that killed Bell in the alley, Grissom swoops by and asks Sara to work with him, saying it'll be fun. Sara goes along, and seems only mildly annoyed by Grissom's normal quiz and games attitude. Based on the information that there was red clay on the gun of the shooter killed in the alley, and eye-witnesses claimed he'd been unarmed while the cops said otherwise, Grissom reconstruced the situation. Sara demonstrates how the shooter threw the gun up and how he caught it when the gun slid back down.\n\nFinally, Sara and Nick assist Grissom in reconstructing the shooting of Bell, using lasers and dummies. Sara, taking Sofia's position, easily determines the cars would have made it unable for Sofia to have killed Bell. The bullet she found in the candle in the previous episode was the deadly bullet, and only a shot from Brass' position would have caused such a shot.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara seems rather curt with Sofia when she finds her talking with Grissom after she's been suspended.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Sofia? You're on administrative leave.  \nCurtis: I know.  \nSidle: You should not be in this building.  \nCurtis: I was just talking to a friend. If I can't talk to a friend, who the hell am I supposed to talk to?  \nSidle: Any friend outside the department.  \nCurtis: And how many friends outside of work do you have, Sara? Maybe I should go talk to my mother. Oh, no, sorry. I forgot. She's a cop, too.  \nSidle: I can recommend a departmental psychologist.  ",

Huxley was killed out of a waiter's revenge on the restaurant's chef, who had made her living off his ideas and their past relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, Grissom and Sara are under review for their relationship, which is in violation of lab policy.

The other CSIs discuss Grissom and Sara's relationship during their cases.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara returns to the lab to have her review with Conrad Ecklie. Having a relationship with another member of the team is in violation of policy. Ecklie asks when Grissom and Sara first began their relationship, to which Sara points out they've always had a relationship. She claims they became intimate two years ago, on a Sunday.\n\nGrissom, however, states they first ...you know_'d nine years ago, prompting Ecklie to tell Grissom they needed to get their stories straight. The two met nine years ago at a Forensics Academy Conference, where Sara wore her hair in a ponytail and asked too many questions about anthropology, while trying to get up the nerve to ask Grissom out to dinner.\n\nIn the end, Sara moves to the Swing shift, so she's no longer under Grissom's supervision. While Grissom had planned to do so, Sara didn't want the rest of the team to suffer. They go, together, to the Go Kart track, and Grissom races with the other CSIs.

Across town, Catherine is attacked at a crime scene where a man was murdered during what appears to have been a home robbery.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Nick help Grissom on the little people murder, discovering how the victim was killed. They check out the victim's hotel room -- already taped off as a crime scene -- and find his fiancee (who is not a dwarf) in there. Sara checks the victim's computer, and finds emails from an online girlfriend -- which started the same day as the victim got call blocking against another woman. When they discover that the photo of the victim's Internet girlfriend is a fake, and is actually a feminization of the victim himself, Grissom defines attraction as narcissism. In the end they discover that the fiancee's father killed the victim because he didn't want his normal-sized daughter dating a dwarf and possibly having a dwarf child.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara once again shows off her prowess with computers.  \nSara shows no prejudice towards the little people.\n\n Quotes\n\nM Grace Does he [Grissom] ever talk?  \nSidle: Um ...

One of the theater's staff says he saw a tall, blond woman leave the cinema during the movie, and she never returned.\n\nMeanwhile, Warrick, Sara and Nick's case centers around a dead fifteen-year-old who was found in a warehouse with mysterious round bruises on his body and a single gunshot through his chest. DNA evidence on a beer bottle discovered at the scene places his older brother, Kevin, at the warehouse, but he denies all knowledge of what happened.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nNot much for Sara in this episode. At the warehouse, Sara takes the outside perimeter, photographing tire treads and shoe prints -- she also finds a long bamboo pole on the roof. She tests the pole for prints and then gsr, finding nothing -- stubbornly refusing to quit, she drags it to Trace (where she trades quips with David Hodges), almost hitting people in the hall.

When they examine the body, Sara notices the victim's eyes were bleeding and calls the CDC. The two are quickly put in special suits and transported to a hospital as they may be infected. The evidence from the case is at risk, since the CDC generally destroys everything to prevent contamination.\n\nThe CDC, working with a lab called Rynelab, determines it is a virus, similar to ebola, and has an 80% fatality rate.\n\nWhile Sara and Greg are in medical lockdown, Nick and Morgan go over the evidence they can (photos at first). They're able to ID the victim as Jack Weaver, a former viral researcher. The bullet casing is traced to Sean Stubbins, whom they find also infected by the virus. Sean saw someone in a CDC type suit and thought they were making meth, so he followed to rob them. When he saw Jack dying, he grabbed the briefcase and ran, but was startled by the man in the CDC plastic suit, so he shot at them and accidentally killed Jack.\n\nJack was obsessed with the virus and its outbreaks for years. Heather Lanning, who worked with Jack at Rynelab, let Jack in to visit. While there he stole a sample. The CSI uses microbial profile to prove that not Jack but Rudy, the lawyer, stole the sample and finds that Rynelab caused an outbreak in Bolivia years ago. Rudy admits he did this because Jack and Rynelab caused his entire family to die.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nThe whole episode is about Greg and Sara. Greg immediately starts to panic, but Sara reminds him that they've been through something similar before. As time goes by, Sara starts to worry that the previous day was the last normal day ever, and an epidemic has started. Greg suggests they stop putting off things they want to do and call his grandmother, but Sara looks thoughtful and sad about.\n\nSara develops a headache and fever, passing out (or rather falling down like a log and scaring the hell out of Greg). Sara asks Russell to let them help solve the case, so they can go out fighting and he agrees, but orders her not to die.\n\nAfter the case is solved, Greg wakes up to see Sara's bed empty and stripped of sheets. As he panics, Sara walks in to tell him she's fine and so is he. The virus dies in the air after roughly two hours.

Jim Brass arrives with SWAT as the negotiator. Once the floor is cleared, they try and open the door. The shooter shoots through the door and we flash back to 15 hours before.\n\nBrass, Grissom, Warrick, David and Doc Robbins are on the scene of a domestic homicide case, where the wife (Janice Cutler) was shot in the face. There is no other signs of a struggle in the room, and Grissom is suspicious. There was signs of sex, but not rape, in the body. The gun was placed inside the mouth. Grissom admits he was only close to marriage when he was seven.\n\nSara and Warrick inspect the house. Warrick laments he and Tina got married so fast. Warrick finds light porn in the house. The gardener's sock was found in the bedroom, and the young man, Timmy, admits that he'd been having an affair with Janice. Timmy says that her husband, Willie, was in a rage, but both were alive when he left.\n\nThe prints on the porn match the husband, and Nick calls one of the numbers. Sally, the hooker, says that she'd been screwing around with Willie, and he'd given her his card. Catherine goes to Willie's office, where a man is found dead on the floor. Another body is dead in the back office, and one man is alive in the back office: Willie Cutler. Willie had no idea his wife was dead.\n\nAt the second scene, the bullets trajectory confirm Willie's story. Willy also claims to have not known Janice was sleeping with Timmy. Willie's story has a few holes, however, as he claims to have lost money at the tables, rather than spending it with Sally and so on. The CSI's verify this as the taxi driver who picked up 'Sammy' had the fare recorded, and it was Willie.\n\nWillie, however, has an older brother, named Sammy, who just got out of prison for grand theft auto. Sammy had ditched his taxi ride to the Lucky Dragon, wanting to go to a casino, so Warrick takes the information to the casino. At the casino, Warrick sees his wife, who lies about where she is. They argue, and Warrick tells her to leave, presuming she's cheating on him, when in reality she was planning his birthday party.\n\nDoc Robbins comes to give Sara the autopsy reports, and says that Willie's 'gunshot' wound was actually done by a sharp object that left a blue trail. Like a pen. Willie's shirt is clean of GSR, and it becomes apparent he stabbed himself with a ball-point pen to make it look like he was shot. Grissom finds traces of Janice's blood on Willie's shirt and tells Brass to get Willie. They suspect the brothers were in on it together.\n\nWillie arrives at the casino, takes the guard's gun, shoots him, takes a woman hostage, and takes the elevator upstairs, bringing us back to where we were in the beginning.\n\nWillie takes a very long time to answer the phone when Brass calls, wanting to come in and talk. Brass is unarmed, and Willie lets him in. Willie says that Sammy was trying to help him, and Brass says he'll trade Sammy for hostage. The catch being that the CSI's don't actually have Sammy.\n\nWillie confesses that he'd blown the $5000 on a hooker, thinking he'd be getting a a $15,000 promotion. But Willie was passed over and then wired himself $50K, all his money. Willie took the money to the Lucky Dragon, so he tried to win big, but it all went south. When Willie got home and confessed to his wife, she insulted him, and Sammy shot her. Willie decided to use his money to get Sammy safe. He went to the office and found his co-workers dead, and realized that his brother did it to protect him.\n\nThe kicker is that Sammy died a month ago. Brass calls out the safe word, Willie shoots him, and the SWAT team kills Willie.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works the side of the case involving the dead wife.\n\nQuotes\n\nSidle: And grass, not the kind you smoke on the floor in the closet. But all the shoes in the closet were clean.  \nBrown: So someone was walking around in here with grass on their shoes? Maybe it was the missing husband... or a desperate gardener.  \nSidle: Who was mowing more than the lawn.",

The gun shop sells illegal gun parts on the side and the killer of the dummped body was one of the attempted robbers of the gun shop.\n\nCarrie Warren is thrown from her own car by Sam Trent, her on again/off again boyfriend, after he attempted to kill himself at her house (but threw up) and accidentally poisoned her dog Roscoe. When Carrie found him and Roscoe, apparently dead, she shoot herself with the gun Carrie's neighbor, John Rakow, had given her to protect herself from Sam, accidentally killing her dog and grazing herself badly.\n\nWhen Sam woke up, not dead, he wrapped the injured Carrie in a quilt and drove her to the hospital, but Carrie was accidentally thrown from the car, struck her head, and died. Sam tucked her in with the quilt and walked to the gun shop, hoping to kill himself there, but ends up walking away unscathed. He goes to their favorite spot in Las Vegas and plans jumps off the deck, but Carrie's neighbor, John, saves him but wants to shoot him. As soon as John lets go of Sam, he jumps back to the railing.\n\nSara is unable to talk him out of jumping, but she managed to stall enough for the emergency rescue team to fill an airbag and save Sam's life.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Catherine work the initial body dump scene and investigate the car when it's found. As the two cases become interrelated, Sara works with Greg and Bobby as they match the guns. She interviews Carrie's neighbor, John Rakow, with Brass, and confirms his innocence with Ray. Ray and Sara go to search their Sam's, house, where they find the photos and letters, confirming Sam and Carrie's relationship.\n\nSara makes the connection of how much money Sam asked his father for, and where he might spend the $8 dollars. It's the cost to take the elevator to the viewing deck at the Ivory Tower which Sam and Carrie liked to visit. Sara and Ray manage to talk John out of shooting Sam, but not Sam out of jumping.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara teases Catherine about her friendliness with Detective Vartann, intimating at a relationship between the two.  \nSara is comfortable with Ray, cheerfully teasing him about taking him to terrible hotels in Las Vegas, like the Ivory Tower.\n\n Quotes\n\nMr. Trent What's this about?  \nSidle: An overdue library book.\n\n",

The case unfolds ambiguously, as the evidence points to an accident or a murder, but neither conclusively. The husband, Ray, was married before and his first wife died of a stroke, falling on the stairs; this is later proven correct by exhumation and autopsy. His recent wife, Becky, doesn't show the classic signs of a fall, however, which confuses the CSIs, who are being pressured by the DA for this high profile case.\n\nBoth Ray and Becky were having affairs -- Becky with her boss and Ray was being bitten by a dentist (played by Hudson Lieck) -- and Ray was being blackmailed about his. The CSIs determine it's Becky who's blackmailing her own husband, threatening to tell herself if he doesn't pay up. Becky was convinced Ray was hiding away money from her, and this was her plan to get it back. Ray's daughter, Susan, had caught onto her step-mother's affair, and after luring Becky into the house, beat her to death with a cane.\n\nThrough it all, Ray insists he slept through it, but the CSIs are quite sure he and the daughter are covering for each other. But they can't prove it.\n\nSara Sidle Review\n\nSara drives Nick and Warrick to the scene; there, she processes the stairs and is the first one to realize that the victim didn't fall as was reported. Sara shares an interesting scene with Grissom in the wife's bedroom. They discuss the reasons a couple may sleep in separate rooms (Sara saying snoring and other mundane reasons). Grissom suggests that they were suffocating each other. Sara comments on sex and romance and gives Grissom a look. Grissom walks off without commenting and they go on to find evidence in the case and move on.\n\nSara and Catherine work well together puzzling out who wrote the blackmail note. Sara's a little surprised to think the wife was blackmailing her husband.

The family's two daughters, the teen who ran for help and her 4-year-old sister, are traumatized but otherwise unhurt.

Spatter and cast off indicates that he was beaten nearly to death in his bed by a blunt and sharp object. While everyone appeared to love the coach, many of them had reasons to kill him or want him out of their life. Running back Calvin Crook is a suspect based on shoe prints, and a desire to enter the NFL draft and skip his senior year. The coach talked him into staying with a platitude and an email link to the death of Andrew Jimenez.\n\nThe secondary case is of a car found in Lake Mead.

Pal admits to crashing the car in the lake (while getting a blow job from Paige) and abandoning her. After Andrew was shot, he panicked and ran, but Coach Miller caught him coming back and helped cover it up to keep the team out of it. When the car was spotted over the weekend, the coach had a crisis of conscience and was going to confess everything.\n\nHowever it was Calvin who killed the coach, upset at having let Coach Miller talk him into staying another year (which he only did because the coach could blackmail him for drinking, doing drugs and whoring around the night Paige died). After the Coach stopped playing Calvin, he got upset and finally snapped.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nGreg and Sara work the sunken car case. Sara remarks on how hard it is to break out of a car, and demonstrates her old skill set with finding evidence in the vehicle. She also shows good eyesight, spotting Jimenez's jacket, hidden in the brush.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara comments on how hard it is to break a car window.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Found Nemo?  \nSanders: Not unless Nemo is a Beemo!\n\n* *\n\nStokes: How's it going?  \nSidle: I'm kind of underwater on this one.\n",

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nThe two forensic teams come back together under the leadership of Grissom and Catherine just in time to tackle three separate investigations: a murdered couple found in bed in a suspicious trailer explosion; a beautiful stripper discovered dead and dumped in the worst part of town; and two bodies found baked and decomposed after spending five days in the trunk of a car exposed to the hot Vegas sun, forcing the CSIs to 'wrap' up the evidence and bring it back to the lab for further analysis.\n\nThe episode starts with a 402 -- fire in a trailer park, with two victims (male and female). The CSIs are all back together, with Catherine giving direction to Warrick. Sara and Nick check the trailer (she takes outside, he takes inside) while a cop suggests it's a meth lab. Brass learns from the neighbors that the woman was single and the car outside wasn't hers, but no one saw anything. One neighbor says he heard the explosion and came out five minutes later because he was watching TV.\n\nCatherine and Warrick leave to check out a 419 (dead body) in the industrial part of time. The woman was found in a bag for a dress and rubber boots. No ID other than that. Catherine notices Warrick's ring and he confesses to having gotten married the day before. Vartann and David Phillips congratulate Warrick. David gives time of death as no more than four hours.\n\nBack at the trailer park, daylight comes and Nick still can't find the cause of the fire. Sara suggests the secondary explosion was from the meter exploding off the trailer like a missile, into the other pipe. Meanwhile at the lab, Greg follows up on the plates from the car at the trailer. He heads off, and Judy gives Grissom some evidence the detectives think are related to The Walter case (Nick being buried alive and all in \"Grave Danger\"). At the autopsy, they determine the mans body doesn't match the scene, as he was run over. Brass interviews the wife, whose car matches tire prints found driving up to the trailer, and accuses her of murder and arson. Naturally she lawyered up. Grissom runs into Sofia, who had left to be a cop in Boulder City, CO, but came back to Las Vegas to be a detective. She'd never really wanted to be a CSI anyway.\n\nCatherine and a female coroner check out their 419 and gets nothing. The rubber boots are from Streets and Sanitation, however, and a nearby code is marked EV. They track this down to a garbage truck driver who admits he found the woman barefoot on the road, gave her the boots and a lift, but didn't know she was dead.\n\nAt the trailer park, Sara takes photos with Nick. The scene doesn't make sense to them. There are tire tracks inside the trailer. They speculate that the wife drove into the trailer and over the husband in bed with the trailer trash. Sara goes to get something to eat leaving Nick alone. As he's looking at evidence, a bug crawls on his arm and he freaks out a bit.\n\nVartann and Warrick check the surrounding area where they found the body. They find pay phones and print them, hoping she called 911. They also get the traffic cam to see if they can place the time of the call.\n\nBack at the lab, Hodges says that the tires match the car of the wife (of the dead guy in the trailer), but the paint does not. Grissom photos the trailer and determines that the car used the gas pipe outside the trailer as a ramp, and launched through the trailer. He finds a headlamp to get them closer on the make of the car. Sofia, Sara and Grissom find a car that matches the description, but it's been parked for over 5 days and has two dead bodies in the trunk, partly liquified.\n\nIn his A/V lab, Archie is listening to the tape that Nick had in the coffin (in \"Grave Danger\") when Warrick walks in to check the video tape from the traffic camera. They determine the woman was a stripper on a limo bus (the Champagne Express) who got into an argument with the patron and dumped in a bad part of town. She was also Brooke Harris, a housewife taking stripper/pole dancing gym class. Her teacher had set her up for the job.\n\nAt the trailer park, Grissom, Nick and Brass run into the drunk guy (who'd left his trailer about five minutes after he heard the explosion). Apparently, while drunk, he'd hit the gas main, vaulted through the other trailer causing it to catch on fire, and then driven home. The car still worked, but the man was obviously messed up from it.\n\nThat leaves Sara and Greg to process the car with the liquid bodies. Greg has to reach in and unplug the drain, which splashes fluid on Sara and into his mouth. The two drain the car, saving the remains, and find a bullet.\n\nHodges has no good news on Catherine and Warrick's case (the rust stain was caused by rust). The CSIs can't figure out why their victim was so far from her car. Warrick wants to talk with Catherine, who's obviously a little upset about his marriage, and explains that he did it because of what happened to Nick. It made Warrick rethink his life. Catherine confesses she's jealous because Warrick was her fantasy man.\n\nBobby the ballistics guru finds a possible match for the bullet Greg found in the trunk of liquefied people. The gun was used in another crime. Sofia goes to play dectective, since she is one, and Sara meets up with Greg and Doc Robbins in the morgue. The man is white and around 25, while the girl is a teenager and black. Greg posits that it was racially motivated. Sara tracks down the girl as likely being Clara James. Clara's father brings lots of DNA samples to Sofia, saying she wasn't smart with people, but she was a good kid who worked at Gooeybunz. She hated the bunz, though, and yet they found a package in the car. Greg flirts a little with Sara as they check the bunz for bite marks, hoping to ID the man, but none were eaten. Instead every one was torn apart and Sara finds a baggy of cocaine in one.\n\nWarrick and Catherine determine that Brooke couldn't get her car because she had no money or ID. They go back to the crime scene where one of the cops had found re-bar but missed that it had blood on it. Warrick follows that to a crazy homeless man, who explained that Brooke took some of his money and he hit her with the re-bar.\n\nBack on the liquified body case, Sara traces the cocaine to Joey Zack, who trafficked his drugs with the Gooeybunz. He'd asked Clara out. Greg pieces togeather the scraps of food left in the car along with the radio station to gather that they'd been at a drive-in. One of the workers there had recently quit, and they learn he'd bought drugs from Zack. They conjecture that he saw Zack, jacked the car, kidnapped the couple, shot them and shoved them in the trunk. And he got away.\n\nAt the end, Nick takes Warrick to dinner to celebrate the marriage. Catherine begs off to pick up her daughter, while Grissom says he'll come, he just has one more thing to do. Grissom and Archie listen to the tape (see \"Grave Danger\") and determine the kidnapper, David Walter, had an accomplice.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nNot a stand out Sara episode, the one showed her doing what she does best: being witty and enjoying being a CSI. Sara allows her hypotheses to be advanced by the change in evidence, and she is quite comfortable showing Greg the ropes. Sara remains as disgusted as she did in \"Bully for You\" about liquified bodies (though perhaps this time her hair won't retain that smell). She also seems to get along better with Sofia, now that she's a detective and not a CSI.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara's 'specialty' of evidence recovery pulls up the gas meter.  \nSara still sort of ignores Greg's flirting.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: You know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park doesn't mean they're a meth cook.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: You know Greg, technically that makes you a cannibal. Grissom would be so proud.  \nSanders: Grissom would probably taste it on purpose.",

Sara and Catherine examine the bomb debris at the lab, then Grissom has Sara check out an orange substance melted on to the clock gear of the timing device.

The brain was in the car of a junkie and former MMA fighter named Danny Clegg, who had it in a cooler in his passenger seat when he OD'd at the fast food joint.\n\nThe brain had been removed by a doctor in Seneca, Hanson Eller, and belonged to an MMA fighter named Ryan Dempsey. Dempsy thought he had Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and donated his brain to research. He had committed apparent suicide, and Dr. Eller removed the brain at the direction of Dempsey's trainer, Bill Pernin. Clegg then went to a mortuary and stole the brain of Lt. Seligson, a recently deceased soldier, who was waiting for his burial in the morning. He traded it with Dr. Eller, who was then shot, at the behest of Pernin, who had been giving his fighters drugs for years and din't want that to come out on review, as it would destroy his career.\n\nBut Dempsey was murdered, not a suicide. His wife had been having an affair with Pernin, and when Dempsey found out, he threatened her. His son, Declan, shot him, and the wife called Pernin who helped cover up the murder and then attempted to protect his own interests.\n\nOf course, Pernin hadn't known that Dempsey and Clegg had a different plan. Dempsey had given Clegg his high school game football, in which he had stored syringes with drugs that Pernin had given him. It was Pernin who shot Dr. Eller following the brain swap, hoping to cover that up.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Nick go over Clegg's car and find a yellow residue, which Sara is later able to match at the mortuary where Lt.

But further examination of the corpse reveals that Braun had been restrained at some point with duct tape, leading Grissom to believe that the victim was forced to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and, perhaps, other drugs.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara hands off 20 rolls of film to be processed, then finds an earring backing on the rug. She later finds balled up duct tape in the kitchen trash, and with an idea she got from a TV commercial, recovers a print from the tape by putting it in the freezer.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is inventive, unafraid to try methods that aren't exactly in the book.  \nSara is supportive of Grissom when he gets a bit down.  \nSara uses a baseball metaphor when talking to Warrick -- her first reference to sports.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Interesting love bites on the chest.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: Oops!

The only survivor is the owner's brother (Vincent), who locked himself in the walk in freezer. Sara, Nick and Greg happen upon the scene, coming by for a meal.\n\nThe cops who had seen the stalker, Ronald Basderic, admit they did nothing, since he was gone by the time he went outside. Of the dead, only two weren't regulars or employees. Finn finds something odd in the blood trails, in that three bodies were clearly moved and staged after being shot.\n\nBasderic shows up in the morgue, asking for Edie, and Doc Robbins has David call Sara for the paperwork. Sara bursts in with a gun and an armed officer, matching a footprint on the scene of the crime to Basderic's shoe. Basderic claims he had left when the cops looked at him, walked around the block, and when he came back, everyone was dead. He went in to check on Edie, but as she was dead, left.\n\nOne of the victims, Alex Brenner, was in WitSec, and had agreed to testify against some 'very bad people.' The US Marshals feel that the men might have killed seven innocents to get to Brenner. Brenner was sitting with a man named Robert Rios, who was not a victim per se, as his stomach contents were nothing that Frank's Diner serves, and he had evidence of having worn both a gun and a ski mask.\n\nThe guns are found, stashed in the newspaper machine, with Basderic's prints on the paper. The prints are coincidence, however. The real killer is Vincent, who shot his brother because Owen wouldn't agree to franchise the diner. He had hired Rios to do a fake robbery, killing only Owen, but when Owen pulled the mask off and shot everyone, Vincent had to move the bodies and finish off Edie.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nRonald Basderic was terrorizing Edie Graham, the waitress, for six months. Sara tried to help her get a restraining order.\n\nSara chases the rabbit trail of Basderic, assuming he had to have stalked someone before. Greg helps her out and finds that Basderic, who claims to hate guns, had shot a man in 'self defense' and was awarded $200k by the judge for it. Sara hates him for it, and for stalking Edie.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara still reacts strongly to women in abusive situations.  \nSara chases rabbits, spending time hunting down Basderic, even though he's not the killer.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: You're done, you son of a bitch.  \n\n* *\n\nBasderic You see. You were wrong. I didn't hurt her. I couldn't. I loved her.  \nSidle: You loved her? Are you kidding me? You terrorized her. You kept her awake at night. You made her afraid to walk down the street. And you want to know what else your twisted love did? It killed her, Ronald. Edie was supposed to be off work at 4:00. She should have been gone when the shooting happened, it she was afraid to walk home because she was afraid that you were out there. It's because of you that she stayed, and now she's dead.\n\n",

While Nick and Greg are dismissive, Dr. Robbins is not. After all, he's got a partly eaten arm in the morgue with the same wound pattern as Owen. Not only is Owen telling the truth, and is a member of 'Vore' culture (vorarephilia -- aka people who get off on eating/being eaten by other people), he knows the arm's owner: Dennis Hagel.\n\nDennis worked in endoscopy, and Owen shares a video of a woman (Miss Feed) who lets herself be 'scoped for voyeurs. Mid video, she's stabbed to death through her stomach. Morgan Brody and Sara review the video and ID the woman as Brenda Waring. When they go to her home, Brenda and Dennis' partly consumed bodies are still in her video room.\n\nNick and Finn go to a Vore party where they find nothing but roleplayers, but Gary Korloff, the host, has the same family crest as that which is on the knife that killed Brenda. Gary, however, prefers to be eaten than to eat, and gave the knife to a 'dark soul' he met online, known as The Eater. Brenda was helping Gary quit the Eater, and when Gary told him, it did not end well.\n\nBetween Gary and Owen's interviews, the CSIs trace the location of the Eater's 'dining room' to Bell Organic Pesticides, which closed in 2011. The knife is there, but no prints or DNA. The sketch is shared with the news, and a security guard claims to have arrested the guy. Only when he leaves the man alone in the car (handcuffed), he ... eats his way out.\n\nHowever the hand is not one that was recently chewed off. The security guard was a liar, Todd Burris claims the hand was given to him by the Eater, who sucked him in with his aura. And then Todd dies from cyanide poisoning, in interrogation. Among Todd's belongings are mementos from Brenda and Dennis. \n\nGary swears that Todd was not the Eater, but the CSIs are split. Todd, perhaps, was the Eater, killing himself to let his legend live on. Or perhaps he was not. We'll never know.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works first the video angel, then Brenda's home, and finally Bell Organic Pesticides' location.\n\nSara, the vegetarian, noticed that Brenda ate a jelly donut wrapped around a hamburger, based on the evidence in her stomach.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara knows about the bizarre Hangover Grill.\n\n Quotes\n\n**Sidle_: The tale of the cannibal who eats through his own wrist just to escape.

When Holly later dies in the hospital, Sara and Catherine track down the killer with some innovative pager work; Grissom refuses to suspend Warrick.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nIntroducing Sara, a CSI III from San Francisco whom Grissom calls in to investigate Warrick Brown. After introducing herself to Catherine (with a cute little bit of interaction about the pager), Sara confronts Warrick, whom she found in a casino. Sara and Catherine don't hit it off immediately. Other than investigating Warrick, Sara follows Catherine around as they solve the Gribbs' murder, though she doesn't actually participate in the case.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara and Grissom have worked together previously.  \nSara and Grissom apparently had some kind of relationship in San Francisco, which he abandoned to come to Las Vegas. (this is partially confirmed in Toe Tags.  \nFirst sign of Sara's sarcastic sense of humor (her initial meeting with Grissom, then her conversation with Catherine about the pager.  \nSara is trying to quit smoking (she offers a piece of Nicorette to Catherine, who says she has her own.  \nWhile Sara doesn't officially aid Catherine in her investigation, she does tag along.  \nThis is the beginning of the period where Sara doesn't trust Warrick because of his gambling problem.\n\n Quotes\n\nGrissom: Norman pushed.

The witnesses, who are primarily black, claim the white officer who shot the black cop did so when the deceased was already down, contradicting what the officer says. The evidence backs up the witnesses, and the rookie officer didn't see what happened. A second case at a school appears to be a gang execution of a snitch, but the cases intersect when the two victims turn out to have been talking regularly. The killing is proven to be coincidental, but the accused killer committed suicide before the CSI's can clear him.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara returns from visiting Grissom in Paris for a week. She joins Ecklie at the morgue to help identify the body and work with the autopsy, before heading to crime scene to work with Greg. At the autopsy, she recognizes that based on the color of the body fat, the dead police officer was a vegetarian, which makes his ordering burgers from a fast food meat restaurant very strange.\n\nWhen the second case comes in, Sara picks it up. When Nick calls the phone of a contact to his case, Sara's victim's phone rings and she answers, connecting the cases. Working with the detectives, and some fancy new software, Sara narrows down her vic's possible killers to a gang known as the D-Street Killers, where they find the killer, and he's also a witness to the cop killing.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nCatherine obliquely references the many times she and Sara have said things to and near each other in the heat of the moment, which Sara acknowledges silently.\n\n Quotes\n\nEcklie: Sara, good to see you back from your week of in Paris.  \nSidle: Ecklie.

Bianca demonstrates a bit of a cleaning jag, prompting the CSIs to suspect she's a speed freak. Chelsea claims they only use drugs recreationally. A drop of blood was found in the bedroom, but it doesn't match Ahren or Bianca, and a bullet is found in a soda can in the garage.\n\nThe blood does match Justin Cole, a meth-using ex of Bianca's. He finds it funny that Ahren was shot at, because he too was shot in the knee and chased away from Bianca. The soda-can bullet happens to match one found in the knee of Bianca's meth-head ex-boyfriend. Since it looks like Ahren fought back, the CSIs determine he managed to avoid the gun, only to be stabbed in the femoral artery, bleeding out in minutes. The bullet, however, is copper, and doesn't help with matching it to anything on a database. The garage is well organized, and Warrick finds one screwdriver that doesn't match anything. The screwdriver belongs to Tom Harper, who installed DSL and provides the work order.\n\nThe main shocker is that Chelsea is Bianca's mother and Happy Harry her father. Chelsea had slept with Ahren and Bianca had found out, but the couple had made up and decided to move to Colorado. Harry, on the other hand, is surprised to find that Chelsea was cheating on him, with Ahren. All of Harry's guns are checked and none match. Chelsea has a gun, but claims it had been stolen earlier that month.\n\nWhen the CSIs go to talk to Bianca about guns, they find her bloddied and beaten in her home. At the ER, after Sara chases out Bianca's parents, Bianca says Sara shouldn't have taken away her father's innocence, regarding her mother's infidelity. Sara says that whomever beat up Bianca is the killer, and Bianca should stop trying to protect her family. But Bianca won't.\n\nThe CSIs review the evidence. The substance found on Bianca's neck (in the ER) is found on railroad ties and telephones poles. Tom Harper's DSL work order was for a Sunday. Sara tests the paper and determines the order has been counterfeited. This leads her to examine phone records and find that Bianca had some serious overlap with her three boyfriends: Tom, Justin, and Ahren.\n\nIn an interview, Tom admits that he had been tapping Bianca's phone line, to keep an eye on her and protect her. He also says that Chelsea had asked him to scare off Justin. Tom tried to scare off Ahren when he overheard Bianca telling her father she wanted to moved to Colorado with Ahren. Only the shot went wide, and when Tom kicked at Ahren's groin, his pole-climbing spike punctured Ahren's aterey. Both he and Chelsea are charged with murder.\n\nMeanwhile, Catherine and Nick work a case that harkens back to Walter Gordon (from \"Grave Danger\"), the man who buried Nick alive. Accountant Sylvia Mullins is killed by her own car, pinned against the wall. The security guard had been asleep, and the camera had been turned out of focus an hour before. This sets the crime as a homicide, and no simple hit-and-run. While going through Sylvia's belongings, Nick finds that she was working with Kelly Gordon, Walter's daughter.\n\nNick interviews Kelly, and determines that Sylvia was the trustee to Walter's estate. He accuses her of murder, and she claims innocence. As Nick reviews the case, he finds the new evidence Grissom logged in \"Bodies in Motion\". Nick confronts Archie on the evidence, and though angry, asks Archie to see if Kelly is the second voice on the tape. It turns out the voice is Sylvia's. Also, the hand that unfocused the security camera was Kelly's and Sylvia was possibly embezzling from her clients.\n\nKelly Gordon is arrested and confesses. She killed Sylvia because the ransom plot was Sylvia's idea. Sylvia had also taken the money from the Gordon estate. As the episode ends, Kelly is ODing on handfuls of meds, and her death is uncertain though likely.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nAfter talking to Bianca in the ER, Sara notices the substance on her skin and snaps up the nurse's gloves. It's this evidence that leads them to look at Tom closer and eventually find the killer. While Sara is more subdued than normal with an abuse case, she still shows her strong distaste in those situations.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara still reacts strongly to rape and abuse cases, where women are victimized.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: (looking at Grissom) I guess some people just shouldn't be together.  \n",

While presenting the news on the storm, the power went out. When it came back up, Theresa was dead of a single puncture wound to the back of the neck. No one else was in the room.\n\nSara and D.B. Russell are the leads on the case, but it's an all-hands-on-deck case, especially since almost everyone has a motive. The autopsy reveals the knife went in at the perfect spot to sever the brainstem, meaning the killer was either really lucky, or really good.\n\nThe power outage was caused by a transform that exploded, which isn't unheard of, though the traces of explosives imply it was done on purpose, as part of a plan to kill Theresa. The temporary co-anchor, Ella St. James, was reporting from the field at the time, only her video was proven to haven been taken at a different time in a different location. Ella admits she was in a different location, but it's because she was having an affair with her camera man (who confesses as well). Ella knew that Theresa was working on a big, secret, case, which the CSIs find ... stuck to the walls in Theresa's bedroom.\n\nThe case was all about a series of warehouse fires in the furniture district from 1996, which were all unsolved, and yet resemble the device used to blow up the transformer the night of Theresa's murder. They also resemble the devices made by a demolitions expert turned motivational speaker, who had been killed via a stab wound to the back of the neck, just like Theresa, and his devices were all the same type as the ones used in the arson 17 years ago, and the transformer from the night before.\n\nIt's not until after the CSIs engage in a game, to see who could kill Theresa, that they peg it on the producer, Fred Paulson. He had been doing favors to friends who helped him with the arson years ago, which he'd done to make his name in news. When Theresa found out, he killed her.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWhile working on the case and chasing rabbits, Sara puts off calls from Grissom, avoiding him because she doesn't want to talk. And he 'needs to talk.' She avoids the call once while heading down to Theresa's autopsy, looking troubled. When DB calls her while she's in autopsy, she hesitates, worried it's Grissom again.\n\nAt Theresa's house, Sara mentions that her place looks similar when she brings work home, even though she's married. That is until she sees Theresa's bedroom, which does not resemble the Sidle/Grissom home.\n\nBoth Russell and Finn notice Sara's a little off, Finn when Sara ignores another call from Grissom, and gently ask her about it, though she rebuffs their inquiries. The third time Grissom calls, Sara is with DB in his office, and he leaves to give her the privacy to answer.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara still knows quite a bit about baseball (likely from her marriage).  \nSara brings work home with her, when she goes home and doesn't stay up all night chasing rabbits.  \nDoc Robbins notes that Sara's instincts are always good.\n\n Quotes\n\nDavid Phillips: When we disceted frogs, when I was in high school biology, you'd pith it, by sticking a pin right here.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nThe miniature serial killer, Natalie Davis, kidnapped Sara  and left her in the desert, trapped under a car. While the CSIs try to determine how Natalie kidnapped her and where Sara might be, three thunderstorms converge on the Las Vegas area, promising flash floods.\n\nThrough flashbacks, the story of Sara's kidnapping and the perils she faced in the desert are told, intercut with her teammates hunt for her and with all the CSIs remembering past cases where they worked with Sara. The stories interweave until the car is found in the dry desert, the morning after Sara's abduction, without Sara underneath.\n\nNick finds Sara's CSI vest, proving she got out from under the car, and Grissom found Sara's footprints, leading away from the car. Following Sara's trail, they find a dead body in the desert, but it's not Sara's. Nick finds Sara, within sight of the road, unconscious. The EMTs arrive moments later, and while Sara appears to be alive, she has no radial pulse. Grissom rides with Sara to the ER in the helicopter.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara had gone to the mall to get food from a vegetarian restaurant, and was in the parking lot when Grissom called to tell her about Natalie Davis. As Sara was putting her things in the trunk, Natalie stepped out and stunned her with a Tazer, and locked Sara in the back of her own trunk. Sara woke up in the back of the car and removed the Tazer needle from her vest in order to cut the plastic restraints holding her hands.\n\nOnce free, Sara peeked out the back of the trunk before breaking out of the trunk and grabbing Natalie as she was driving the car. Sara's actions caused Natalie to loose control of the car and, in the scuffle, Sara was tossed out of the car. Natalie retrieved Sara and tied her back up again in the back-seat, waking her up with some water. Sara talks to Natalie, trying to bond over their shared experiences in foster homes and lost fathers.\n\nThe water was drugged, however, and Sara passed out shortly after realizing that Natalie was doing this because of Grissom. When Sara woke up, she was in the desert and Natalie was lowering the upside-down red Mustang onto Sara. Natalie drove off, and as Sara lay trapped, coyotes approached. They did little more than sniff at her before the thunderstorms started and drove them off.\n\nWhile trapped under the car, with the water rising, Sara struggled to get free. Her trapped arm prevented her from doing so, while also preventing her from keeping her head above water. In trying to escape, Sara broke the rear-view mirror of the car, using it as a lever to free her arm and then free herself from the car. Hiking in the desert, Sara used her shirt as a bandana and sling, and make her way to the safety of the rocks, where she was able to see how far from civilization she was.\n\nLeaving little cairns along her way, Sara continued to hike in the 110 heat, keeping herself awake by doing multiplication in her head. The trials of the day prove to be too much, and Sara passes out, only fifty yards from the road. Nick spots the reflections from the mirror, and Sara is taken by helicopter to the ER.\n\nSara wakes up in the helicopter with Grissom smiling at her, and she returns the look.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara doesn't like car trunks, because in her line of work, you only find corpses in them.  \nSara knew that Natalie was a cleaning person at the lab, and recognized her.  \nSara calls Grissom by his first name for the first time.  \nEven bruised, battered and drugged, Sara kept her wits and determined while Natalie kidnapped her.  \nWhen cornered, Sara fights back.  \nSara eats at the veggie place in the mall 2 or 3 times a week.  \nWhen Sara tells Natalie about her foster experience, she says that she was all alone -- no mention of an older brother.  \nSara tries to walk out of the desert rather than wait for help -- she prefers to do things herself rather than rely on anyone.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Hello, Gilbert.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I have a fear of trunks. In my line of work, you only find one thing in them.\n\n",

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nThe CSIs investigate a present-day crime with ties to a mob heist that occurred 25 years ago, out in Ellis Springs. Back in 1989, a trio of local kids got tangled in a heist, where the loot was never recovered and one of them (Scotty Gates) was presumably killed as he was never seen again. Of the survivors, Roger Mathers had moved to Texas, but when his solar-panel company started failing, high-tailed it back to Nevada, and ended up dead near the shack where the kids ran into the mob all that time ago. The last survivor, Tyson Briggs, says he talked to Roger, but didn't know why he was there.\n\nA rare type of fingerprint Sara finds at the scene is matched by Finn to ones found on Scotty Gates' glasses. The print matches a retired deputy from Ellis Springs, Sam Bishop (special guest Treat Williams), who was fired shortly after the case was closed for insubordination. Bishop was way ahead of his time with regards to forensics, impressing Sara, and his fingerprint was on the photo at the crime scene because the original was his photo!\n\nThe CSIs follow the old photos to where the missing loot was buried, but find Scotty Gates' body. The shovel where the body was found had lotion on it that matched the kind used by Sam's daughter, Karen, who had gone to the burial site with Roger and given him the photos. With the body, the CSIs are able to determine the height of the killer, based on the angle of the skull indentation, and Tyson Briggs suddenly is a suspect.\n\nOnce arrested, Tyson confesses he had wanted to keep the loot, but Scotty wanted to tell the cops, so he hit Scotty in the head with the closest thing at hand: a million dollar jade lion. However Tyson didn't kill Scotty. Before he died, Karen, Sam's daughter, arrived, having tailed the boys, and warned them a car was coming. When the kids hid behind a rusted out car, she covered his mouth with her hand to muffle him, and he died. The three kids, Karen, Tyson and Roger buried Scotty, and they hid the loot at Rogers house. Before they could spend the money, the house burnt down and all the money with it.\n\nKaren also killed Roger, taking the stone lion, and hid it and the gun she used out behind her house. Her father, Sam, once he heard about her involvement, went to her hiding place, found the evidence, and turned it in.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Brass has a decision to make when his daughter attempts suicide. \n\n Sara Sidle Review## \n\nWhile Ellie is in the hospital, Sara visits Brass and comforts him, telling him someone else's madness is not his fault, nor his responsibility.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is comforting to Brass, connecting over the shared insanity of their families.  \nSara has a geek crush on Sam Bishop's science.",

While Sara, who worked the case a decade ago, is upset (she hates Slade), she's stunned to learn that Abby now remembers details about the case. Abby remembers that someone picked her up and put her in the sleeping bag, not knowing she was still alive, but the man had a beard and a smell that was not her father's.\n\nAn autopsy and blood test of the exhumed body of the father shows he'd been drugged with a knockout drug. It's enough to reopen the case, and fingerprints belonging to registered sex offender Garth Fogel are found in the tent. Fogel's also the biological father of Hannah, Abby's older sister.

When Greg proves Sara's initial hypothesis incorrect and there was a bomb, she teases him but cheerfully tests his theory with him.\n\nWhen Russell tells Sara about his cousin, who became a paranoid schizophrenic, she mentions she understands, because of her mother.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara still likes taking apart cars.  \nSara mentions her mother to Russell, but without details.  \nSara still falls for the human condition -- when told a seemingly true, touching, story, she's inclined to believe it.\n\n Quotes\n\nMorgan Brody I've had dates end that way.

One of the girls was raped. The killer was recently released from a California prison, and Sara is able to match his DNA to a wine bottle.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nAfter her date is canceled, Sara arrives to help with the scene. She is attacked by the last victim, who is hiding under the bed, but then asked to help her. Sara spends much of the episode assuring her teammates that she's alright after the attack, and trying to decipher Cammie's dying words. Initially, Sara presumes the words are 'Pour wine', but she finally determines them to be 'port wine,' and reference a birthmark on the killer.\n\nAs she solves the case, and throughout the episode, Sara flashes back to being with Cammie as she died. It's the first time Sara has been on the scene as a victim died, and it strongly affects her. Sara follows an apparent male victim to the hospital and determines that he was the killer while checking under his nails for evidence. The killer grabs Sara while still in his hospital bed, but she gets away and is able to get enough evidence to bring him in.\n\nThe killer confesses; however Sara admits she lost her perspective and got too close the case. By taking Cammie's death personally, she in turn attaches herself to the next presumed victim. While, in the end, this proves crucial to solving the case, Sara is angry that she felt for the killer, back when she'd thought him to be another victim. Grissom wipes a tear from her face as they watch the news of the killer's confession, and they leave together, Grissom's arm around her waist.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara was on a date before being called into the case.  \nThis is the second time that Sara has been attacked by a killer.   \nSara is scratched on the left cheek by the dying showgirl.  \nSara has a history of getting too attached to victims.   \nAfter it's over, Sara admits that she lost perspective, and took someone at face value. \n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: My date got canceled.  \nGrissom: I'm sure he had a good excuse.  \n\n- -\n\nStokes: It was good that you were there for her, Sara.

Warrick tries to help a young inmate who witnessed the murder of a gang member.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara gets all pumped up when she and Nick get the case of a body found 40 miles outside of town, but when they get to the corpse she's a little nauseated by it: a skinned, headless body, missing its hands and feet. Sara aids Nick now and again on the case (including searching the suspect's car which is actually Catherine's case), but mainly goes off on her own when it's discovered that the skinned corpse is actually a gorilla.\n\nWhen she starts getting emotional watching videos on the computer, Grissom tells her that it isn't a case since the body isn't human -- something which Sara argues against, and Grissom agrees with her. Sara questions Dr. Miller about the mutilation and skinning of the gorilla's body. Whomever killed the gorilla will never be found, but Sara plays her own part in laying the case to rest by burying the gorilla's ashes in a small ceremony out in the desert.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara definitely gets emotional -- and possibly a little too involved -- when a case deals with the death and mutilation of an animal.  \nSara's evaluation: 'Overall Performance: outstanding' and 'Ability to Prioritize: improvement needed.'\n\n Quotes\n\nGrissom: Sara, go with Nick.  \nSidle: Yes!

But when Silvana's sister Marta is tortured, poisoned and killed, it seems that Silvana has also become the target of a vengeful killer. Marta was killed elsewhere and her body brought to Silvana's dressing room, staged in one of her dresses at her vanity.\n\nWhile Silvana is hugely popular, a large number of protesters are outside her venue: Cuban exiles who wanted her to return to Cuba. Her manager, Antonio Ficha was also her handler, meant to ensure Marta and Silvana don't expatriate and stay in the USA. The leader of the Cuban Exiles, Eddie Santos, was the owner of the shop where Marta was tortured and killed. While his DNA is not a match for that found on the scene, it does match a relative. Eddie's nephew is Estefan Meha, owner of the club where Silvana is performing, and Eddie was tortured by Silvana's father back in Cuba before he escaped to America.\n\nWhile being beaten, Marta was also poisoned by being force fed casava leaves, a plant that causes cyanotic effects when eaten. When Silvana comes down with the same symptoms (though she was poisoned via pills), and it's determined that Marta had been in contant with a restricted number in Washington DC, it's apparent Marta was considering leaving Cuba for the United States forever and had called seeking asylum. This is, in part, due to Estefan, who was in love with Marta. They met up at Eddie's shop to make love, and Silvana found out and killed her sister.\n\nMarta wanted to come to the US, and to marry Stefan. But Silvana was also in love with Estefan, and killed her sister over that, framed Antonio, and coerced him into killing Estefan by tricking him into thinking Antonio killed Marta.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works the case and is in somewhat of a hostile mood towards the club owner, who only has functional security cameras aimed at the cash register. This appears to be directly related to the fact that it's women who are being targeted.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is belligerent towards the club owner regarding the safety of the women involved.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: If you want this show to go on, you have to fix these cameras.  \n\n* *\n\nSidle: I don't wanna go to that CIA place but ...

Ecklie's not as happy about all this, as always, concerned with the budget, when a high priority case comes in.\n\nActress Olivia Hamilton has been found dead in her car following what appears to be a traffic collision, but what is actually a murder by Olivia's boyfriend's bodyguard, Tom O'Neill. O'Neill was being paid to break up the boyfriend and Olivia by the boyfriend's father, and since Olivia was pregnant, he killed her and attempted to blame it on her stalker. The evidence points to the lawyer, but the stalker confessed, making it harder for the CSI's to prove their case. Making it worse, a group of Russians mobsters, pretending to be morticians, come in to steal the body of an unnamed bum from a fleabag motel, who was actually Olivia's father, and toss him through a wood chipper, because he too was killed by O'Neill.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nNow married, Grissom and Sara were in France, allowing Grissom to lecture at Sorbone while they waited for a research grant to be approved. Ecklie called to say the lab was short handed, but also because Riley blames Catherine's management style (or lack there of) for her reason to leave.

While she's in the all natural mud springs with another man, Santo, the dead body floats to the surface.\n\nJustin Wade had attended as part of a corporate retreat, but wasn't a fan of the New Agey aspects, and skipped out on the firewalk, upsetting his teammates. After spending some time in the mud springs (and spurning the advances of a coworker), Justin went back to the firewalk and attempted it and somehow fell into the coals, killing himself in the process. Alan claims not to have known that Justin was the dead man, and admitted that Justin did ask to try the firewalk afterwards, but Alan turned him down because he wasn't ready.\n\nThe autopsy reveals Justin had an allergic reaction, causing him to go into anaphylactic shock. As he was allergic to latex, and inhaled it at the firewalk, Greg goes back to sort through the coal and ash, where he finds latex hormone pellets made by Bixton, the pharmaceutical company Justin worked for. Meanwhile, Sara interviews the wife, telling her that signs pointed to Justin having an affair with a coworker, Jessica Lowell. The wife admits she suspected as much, but decided not to confront them about it: she trusted her husband.\n\nJessica was suspected of stealing company secrets, but in truth she worked in security, teamed with the FBI. Justin and fellow teammate Heather Connor were making meth. Meth which caused Heather to OD while being interviewed by Finn. Goat milk was found in Heather's stomach, and goat hair on her skin, as well as in some street drugs, so the CSIs follow the leads to a drug lab in the middle of nowhere. Curiously, the trashed lab is far too high tech for just meth, including goat's milk enzymes and membrane patches. Hiding in the lab is Justin's wife, Mary.\n\nMary has a rare blood disorder, and Justin joined Bixton to steal the formula for her and brew it on his own (goat's milk being an ingredient). Since that was expensive, he and Heather made meth to pay for it all. But Mary did not destroy the lab, she found it that way when she went to pick up her meds. Blood found on the scene points to Alan Quinn as the break-in. Alan was in love with Mary, and killed Justin because he thought Justin was poisoning her.\n\nThe subplot is Hodges and Elisabetta. He distrusts her for being at the retreat with Santo, whom she claims is her brother. Meanwhile she worries about Hodges' relationship with Morgan Brody, who claims they're just friends. But Hodges has been having second thoughts.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works with Doc Robbins in autopsy and later talks to the wife. When she goes to talk to Hodges later, and he's wearing a blue swimming cap with a bright flower on it, she doesn't want to ask, even though he claims to have worn it for her. Sara also digs deeper into the evidence, finding that Mary has a strange disease, and Justin was making a cure for her.\n\nAt the end, when Sara returns Justin's wedding ring to Mary, they discuss love, loneliness, and fear. \n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara's sense of humor is a little lacking.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle:: I'm not gonna ask.  \nHodges:: Really? How disappointing.  \nSidle:: Not doing it.  \nHodges:: I wore it for you.  \nSidle:: ... Fine. What?\n\n",

Taylor's murder was part of an elaborate plot created by Ronald Basderic to discredit Sara and pave the way for her own murder. Basderic planned the murder for months and in the end is tripped up by the CSIs working together.\n\n Sara Sidle Review## \n\nCelebrating her birthday alone at a hotel, Sara is approached by Taylor Wynard, who buys her a mini-cake. After dinner she went with Taylor to his room and the next morning, while checking out, learned Taylor was dead -- stabbed seven times. Right away, Sara talks to D.B. Russell about how she knows Taylor, however she states nothing happened. Yes, she went to his room and they had a little more wine, but she went back to her room alone shortly after Grissom texted her birthday wishes. The phone records claim that she called Taylor at 2am, and the room key records say she came back into her room around 3am. Sara has no memory of this, as she'd taken a sleeping pill.\n\nOf the CSIs, Greg wants to talk about it, Nick doesn't, Hodges's feels like she cheated on God, Doc Robbins wants to protect both Grissom and Sara, Morgan understands why Sara might cheat, and Finn wonders whose team everyone is on. Only Finn brings up the point that more people are paying attention to Sara's possible infidelity than the fact that she's been accused of murder. On Finn's advice, Sara goes home to relax, only to find the murder weapon being cleaned in her dishwasher.\n\nFaced with photographic evidence, Sara explains that she met Taylor once before, two weeks ago, and they kissed outside a bar. But she did not cheat on her husband. Russell and Nick are concerned about Sara's behavior, and she admits that she and Grissom have divorced, implying it was something Grissom did with her best interests at heart. So yes, she's been having trouble lately.\n\nThe necklace found in the hotel room is Sara's, but she she insists she was not wearing it that night. In a parking garage by his work, Sara confronts Ronald Basderic, because the necklace was one that Edie gave her for helping file a case against Basderic. Basderic provokes Sara, remarking on her troubles. Sara slaps the phone out of Basderic's hand when he offers to call Grissom, and shoves him to the ground.\n\nBack at her house, Sara is trying to get Basderic's phone records when the police come to bring her in. Basderic has come to the police, viciously beaten, claiming Sara did it. The parking garage camera shows that she shoved him, but Basderic moves out of the camera's frame shortly there after. Sara's processed, since there's enough evidence to indicate she did beat him. Thankfully Sara's clothes are free of any trace, supporting her claims. The CSIs consider Basderic for the crime, and how easy it would have been for him to find the information. When Basderic serves Sara with a restraining order, Sara is put on leave, and the team doggedly tries to exonerate her and find evidence against Basderic.\n\nWhile Sara was in lock up, her mother gets a bottle of alcohol and ends up in the ER with blood poisoning. When Sara goes to visit her mother, Laura says she prayed Sara would never turn out like her, but there Sara stabbed Taylor, just like Laura stabbed Sara's father. There's no way Laura should have known about that, and when Sara presses her, Laura says that Sara's friend 'Ronald' told her. Sara rushes home to get her personal weapon out of her gun locker.\n\nChecking the key logs, Nick verifies thats someone used a keycard override on Sara's room shortly before midnight. Hodges determines that Sara's sleeping pills had been tampered with, double strength. Morgan finds that the shower drain grates between Sara and Taylor's rooms have been swapped. Greg finds sight of Basderic on the hotel's surveillance. At this point they determine that Basderic is setting Sara up, like he did another man years ago, so he can shoot her and get away with it.\n\nWhile Sara's stalking Basderic's house, the CSI's pull over Basderic and take his gun while talking to him. When Basderic isn't paying attention, the detective swaps the bullets for blanks. Sara breaks into Basderic's house and threatens him, saying she's going to stop him. Sara fires the gun at him, only to find that Basderic removed the firing pin from her gun.\n\nBasderic tells Sara he was, indeed, behind everything. He'd hacked her email, followed her, paid Taylor to come to see her at dinner, even paid for the cake, and planned for months, just to have her at his mercy. He fires his gun, not harming Sara in the least, and she pulls out a voice recorder, showing she had, in fact, set him up with the help of the CSIs.\n\nWith the case closed, Nick and Greg come to Sara if she wants to talk. She tells them she had hoped Grissom would come for her birthday anyway, and thanks them for not giving up on her.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is still wearing her wedding ring.  \nSara has been having trouble sleeping.  \nSara and Grissom are no longer married.  \nSara moved her mother closer to Las Vegas six months ago, though she doesn't see her any more often.  \nA birthday 'date' was arranged before they split up, and Sara was hoping Grissom would come anyway.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Suddenly being alone in my hotel room doesn't sound like that much fun.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: A little late for an intervention, don't you think?  \nStokes: Well, I just thought--  \nSanders: We.  \nStokes: We just thought that it might be a good idea to talk.  \nSanders: Or listen.

I honestly expected him to show up.  \nStokes: I think that we all liked the idea of you two being together, that maybe it was because that was our way of hanging on to him just a little bit. But if it's over... It's over.  \nSanders: You can't sit around waiting forever.  \nStokes: And you'll always have us.  \nSanders: Like it or not.  \nSidle: Thank you.

        "content": "\nSynopsis \n\nGwen Onetto is found murdered in front of a miniature casino model. The model is of the Premiere, a casino that never was, because Jack Witten was accused of murdering a young woman fourteen years ago.\n\nWhen D.B. Russell arrives, Jim Brass explains that fourteen years ago, Jack was a suspect in a similar murder, but they had no evidence. Sara , having wandered away from Greg, is exploring the house alone. She tells DB that this is one of the cases that got away. It was Sara's first high profile case since joining the team in Las Vegas.\n\nDown in the cold-case storage, Sara runs into Conrad, who has already pulled the files. They go over the old case, the evidence they had is slim, and consists of a carpet fiber found soaked in blood in the trunk of Darcy's car. The fourteen year-old fiber is a visual match to the sample Sara took the night before, following Gwen's murder. It is not, according to David Hodges, an actual match, and Sara must yet again tell Darcy Blaine's father that they have nothing new.\n\nBack at Witten's house, Greg tries to find a fiber match, and instead finds a secret, climate controlled room. Tied up in the room is Gwen's friend, Emily Bridwell, who had come to Witten's house with her, and claims that Witten lured them there, tied her up in the preservation room, and killed Gwen. However, Gwen and Emily were both suspects in robbery cases in the area, and when they find the murder weapon (a flashlight) it has Emily's prints all over it. Before they can question her, Emily dies in the hospital, from having swallowed a roll of film.\n\nThe girls had all the security codes to Witten's house, and were a regular Bling Ring. It turns out Emily killed Gwen because Gwen slept with her boyfriend. When Hodges is able to recover the film, it's filled with Darcy Blaine.\n\nWitten claimed he'd never met Darcy before, but the fact that the film was in his vault certainly makes the suspect. The CSIs trace the film to the camera that filmed it, and from there to Robert Gear, a cameraman Witten hired to film the opening of the Premiere (which never happened). Of course... Gear is found dead in his house, shot in the head with a .22 caliber. Gear had received payments from an LLC owned by Witten to fund his casino, presumably blackmail money. Having run low on money, Gear hired the girls to steal the film.\n\nFinally Witten admits he did know Darcy. He'd met her at NA -- Narcotics Anonymous. They were both screwed up, addicts, but they both loved old movies. So she and Witten were friends who watched the movies. He thought of her like a daughter, but fell back into drugs. After the club, he woke up with Darcy dead in the bed. Bob Gear showed up and helped him get rid of the body, but Witten kept a photo of Darcy's dead body to remind him of the kind of man he really was.\n\nSara is not as pleased about the confession as one might expect. The bullet used to kill Gear was not a match to Witten's gun. Greg manages to restore the film more, and finds that it was shot two months after Darcy's death. Darcy faked her death to get away from her father, who may have abused her.\n\nSara Sidle Review \n\nFourteen years ago, Sara and Catherine worked the case where Jack Witten was accused of murdering Darcy Blaine, an eighteen year-old he met at a bar and who was never seen again after leaving with Witten. When they were unable to come up with enough evidence, Conrad Ecklie (then only the dayshift lead) took the case from them. With Grissom away at a conference, there was nothing Catherine or Sara could do to prevent the case from being filed away as a cold case, unsolved until now.\n\nSara is, again, a soft touch for a sob story that hits her in the right place. She immediately believes Emily's story, even when DB is skeptical, because she's chasing rabbits. DB warns her not to push too hard.\n\nHowever, when faced with Darcy, Sara stays true to justice. Instead of relying on justice when (and if) her father abused her, Darcy's choice to pervert it, let innocents suffer, and in the end, commit murder is too much for Sara to let slide. But Sara doesn't know what to believe anymore.\n\nCharacter Notes \n\nSara still chases rabbits. \n\nQuotes\n\nRussell: Sara, got something?  \nSidle: A piece of the past.\n\n* *\n\nSidle: Terrible, unspeakable things happen to all of us. But that doesn't give us the right to destroy someone's life. Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for fourteen years you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about. The one person in his screwed up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter. You took his desire to protect and save you and you perverted it. You twisted it. I know you. I know who you are. You haven't changed, Darcy. You never will.\n\n* *\n\nRussell: That thing I said to you? About pushing too hard?

When David Phillips (Assistant Coroner) stumblingly hits on her while she's checking the database, she gives him some tips for 'pulling chicks', including giving him a 'C for cute'. Sara discovers the corpse was buried a week ago; and excavates the grave only to find no casket in the grave (ruling out the funeral director's claim of grave robbing). Sara checks out caskets for sale at the funeral home and discovers they've been re-used. Sara confronts the mortuary director.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara wants to be cremated when she dies rather than be buried with the worms.  \nSara is apparently comfortable with guys hitting on her -- or at least comfortable with David Phillips hitting on her.  \nSara appreciates the gentlemanly gestures shown by the detective at the scene.  \nSara imposes her own sentence on the mortuary owner, telling him how he's going to make restitutions before she even talks to the D.A.\n\n Quotes\n\nGrissom: Sara, body of your own.

Instead, one of them is brutally murdered, strung up on a meat hook just like the boys Simms killed twenty years ago. Jim Brass worked on the original case. The ghost hunters claim it's proof of the 'other side' contacting the living. The property manager, who assures Brass that the ghost hunters signed 'a million' liability waivers, mentions that he always found the place creepy and disturbing, and plans to tear it down. Doc Robbins, who was also familiar with the original case, points out to Russell that because the original victims were juveniles, the details of the murders were never released. Thus the fact that the murder was exactly like the originals is highly disturbing.\n\nMorgan and Greg find a shrine for the original victims, while Sara and Finn follow luminol-lit trails of blood to find the murder weapon. The weapon has the fingerprints of Owen Webber, the leader of the ghost hunters, who also has 98 seconds of missing video on his camera, but is determined to be innocent when voice recordings prove he was in another room.\n\nOne of the trial groupies from the original case, Monica Downs, is spotted in old photographs, wearing an earring that matches one found at the shrine. While the CSIs look for her, a second of the ghost hunters is bludgeoned to death by a metal baseball bat in the shrine room. When the groupie is found, the blood of the latest victim is on the soles of her shoes. But while Monica is crazy, it's not her DNA found on the toys in the shrine, nor the baseball bat. The DNA matches an unknown sample, found in Simms' car during the original case, indicating an accomplice.\n\nThomas Pope was 11 when Simms kidnapped him, but ran away when Simms was caught. In the twenty years since, he became the property manager for the slaughterhouse. As they determined that, Pope was letting a curious Greg into the property to look around before it was demolished. Greg gets the drop on him, arresting Pope before he can kill Greg. Pope was really foster child, Jonathan Harris, and built himself a new life and identity. He was afraid that the ghost hunters would find out who he was by talking to the dead boys.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Finn tease David Phillips a little at the crime scene, but once he leaves, both admit to being creeped out by the location (a slaughterhouse). While working the scene, Sara gets a call from SFPD and says she'll call them back later.\n\nAfter the case, Sara asks DB for a leave to return to San Francisco and work on the Lyle Brinks case. Brinks is up for parole, and Sara and the cop who arrested him worry he may actually get it. DB gives it to her, without hesitation, provided she actually takes a couple days off for herself as well.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara claims a slaughterhouse is why she stopped eating meat (this contradicts when she said that it was Grissom's pig experiment )  \nThe Lyle Brinks case Sara worked on in San Francisco was well known.\n\n Quotes\n\nFinn It's for you.

The economic downturn has led to more renters and people of shadier incomes. The investigation leads them to a peeping tom by the name of Craig Mason, adopted son of Judge Mason (aka Paul Millander), now a teenaged goth with a penchant to heavy metal music. They find a second body, his throat slit similarly to Lester, but on the ground outside his house, which he's using as a drug house. The Mason's house is in between the porn house and the drug house. Both men were killed within the same period of time, by the same weapon. Ray feels that none of the other CSIs are able to be unbiased regarding Craig, and after performing an experiment with him, proves Craig didn't commit the murders. Sara and Nick go back over the evidence and determine the captain of the neighborhood watch performed the killing, in an attempt to clean up the neighborhood.\n\nRay and Doc Robbins find a backlogged corpse with a surprise inside: his small intestine is died green and tied around his spleen. The man died of natural causes, and the body shows no sign of incisions. They suspect it was done laparoscopically but Ray finds it difficult to duplicate those results. Nicknaming the killer Dr. Jekyll, they determine he took the corpse' bow tie, and suspect they will see his handiwork again.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Nick are the first CSIs on the scene for Ryan Lester. While inspecting Craig Mason's room, Sara recognizes the horror mask made by Paul , as well as the fake hand. When Nick tells her Craig's full name, Sara connects him to the split personality serial killer. Sara attempts to connect with Craig, over their similarly traumatic past, but he hates all CSIs and refuses to cooperate.\n\nSara apologizes to Craig before they release him. Craig confesses that he never knew Paul Millander, as his father would take him to Hollowierd and told him that Mr. Millander owned it. He loved the idea of Paul Millander, never knowing that Paul was his father. When Craig is released, his mother doesn't come to pick him up, so Sara takes him home.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara refers to herself as 'Mrs. Grissom', in jest, and denies that she's taken his name.  \nSara is happy to see David Phillips, the coroner.  \nSara loved the band Black Sabbath for a summer.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: [deadpan] Jeepers creepers.\n\n* *\n\nSidle: Dave!

Russell that Sara was involved in a shooting in Larkston, but there's still no word on Finn. DB and Nick take a helicopter out to find Sara has been grazed by a bullet, but Finn is missing. We cut to Finn, who is beaten and bloodied, walking down a desert road, only to be hit by a car. Sara is checked out alright, and she is sent back to talk to Brass while DB puts a BOLO out on the last car Finn was seen using.\n\nForty-eight hours before, Morgan was leaving on a trip to a spa in Reno, and since Finn and Sara also had the weekend off, they decided to make a trio of it. Taking Finn's car is a mistake, as it breaks down, leaving them stranded in Larkston. They make the best of it, with drinks and karaoke, until Finn leaves with the mechanic, Darryl. He turns out to be married, so she leaves him, only to be attacked and assaulted, with intent to rape. In the tussle, Finn stabs Darryl with his own knife and leaves him for dead. Except ... the body vanished.\n\nWhen the trio arrived at the scene, there was no body, and the evidence indicated Darryl survived and left with someone else. The sheriff showed up at that point, hauled all three off for questioning and accused Finn of making the story up. While Morgan handed over the photos to the local police, they also sent the photos to their own lab, where Greg pulled up records based on the tire prints, and Darryl's wife become's a suspect.\n\nShe is, of course, exonerated when she proves she was at work, and drove straight to Las Vegas afterwards, but the evidence on the truck showed that Darryl was growing marijuana in an old barn, where he stored cars and the dead, mummified body of a young woman. Two other women also had gone missing in the same area, indicating Darryl had raped and killed them as well. Sara leveraged that to get Finn freed from house arrest and working on the case, where she learned there were traces of algae on the dead girl's shoes.\n\nAt the same time, Sara went with the sheriff and deputy to where Darryl's car had been abandoned. While Darryl's gone, Sara gets a call from Henry that the deputy's DNA was found on the body. When confronted, the deputy shots the sheriff and tries to shoot Sara, but she kills him first, catching us up to 'now.'\n\nThe sheriff corroborates Sara's story, and she goes back to Las Vegas, while Nick and DB trail Finn's car and, eventually, find both a dead Darryl (shot by Finn), and a nearly dead Finn (after being hit by the car). Morgan and Sara process Finn and her clothes, finding that she was hit by a car owned by the town's doctor and coroner. He too was in on the rapes and kidnapping.\n\nSara Sidle Review\n\nSara initially planned to go home, drink some wine, and watch old movies. While she's interested in the idea of the spa, she does seem awkward around the younger Morgan, and slightly out of touch with the time. When Finn returns to the bar, cut and disoriented, Sara takes charge to find out what happened. \n\nWhile Sara is angry that she, and Finn and Morgan, aren't taken seriously by the local authorities, she's also stubbornly helpful and nudges her way into their case with evidence and facts.\n\n Character Notes\n\nSara likes Hepburn and Tracy movies  \nSara doesn't know who BeyoncÃ© is \n\nQuotes\n\nSidle: Larkston was never part of the plan. How often do we all have the weekend off?  \n\n* *\n\nSidle: Uh... who's BeyoncÃ©?  \n\n* *\n\nSidle: So, what do you want to do next weekend?\n\n",

While there, they see Jane Snyder. Sara does not want to see Jane, but alas the woman is excited to see her old friend. On the other hand, Finn runs into an old friend with whom she regularly hooks up at conventions. During 'Dr. Jane's' presentation, which includes dancing go-go men, a single shooter with an AR-16 blasts the room, killing multiple people.\n\nMeanwhile, the boys back at the lab are working the case of a liquified body of a security guard who just so happens to work at the hotel where the conference is taking place. The dead guard's key card was used recently, putting the attendees in danger, as the shooter, Jeff Lasky, had the card. Lasky is shot and killed by SWAT in the hotel. Lasky was after Dr. Jane, the expert witness who previously kept the man who eventually killed his family out of jail.\n\nAfter the scene is cleared, the CSIs find a second killer who is targeting, among other people, Sara.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Jane were criminalists in San Francisco before Jane switched teams to become an expert defense witness. Jane skewered one of Sara's trainees on the stand, engendering animosity between the two. During the shooting, Sara keeps her sanity and spots the shooter and his gun.

A homeless man dies in an alley, a married couple are killed in a seedy hotel room, and a bee dies in mid-flight.\n\nThe couple in the hotel room were killed by their 12 year-old daughter, who they thought was possessed by a devil, and kept her locked in an attic room much of the time. After hiring a local minister who specialized in exorcism, the father had second thoughts and freed his daughter, who hooked up with an older man she'd met online. After having sex with him, she killed her parents and her younger sister. The minister, who earlier had been preaching to the poor masses of Las Vegas that they were in hell, finds the 12 year-old and throws her off a balcony, killing her and completing the exorcism.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works the case of the dead homeless man, who died after getting in a fight with another bum over a sandwich, and was briefly detained by the police. Sara questions the police officer involved, who says he didn't bring the man in because he thought it was a ploy by the homeless man to get some AC in the heat. Sadly, the man died of exposure.\n\nWorking the swing shift, Sara's new partner is the rookie, Ronnie Lake, who annoys Sara with endless questions, very few of which are pertinent to the case. The questions prompt Sara to institute a 20 questions a case rule. Sara cracks down on the rookie when she wonders if it's right to consider the police as suspects. Sara also misses her friends on the night shift, and is very pleased to talk to Brass and Greg when she sees them.\n\nOnce Sara is off the clock, she goes and visits Grissom at his crime scene, where he's stealing bees (with permission). She comments on something she read about the deaths of bees, and Grissom corrects her. At this point, Sara is still wearing a sling, but no large (or visible) cast, and most of her facial injuries have healed.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara takes her frustrations out on the rookie.  \nSara does not appear to be enjoying her time on swing shift.  \nSara comments on the deaths of bees and what it means to the world.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Ronnie, I'm going to have to limit you to twenty questions per case.  \n\n- -\n\nLake Oh, you're not seriously going to go after the cops over something like this.  \nSidle: You know, I'm going to answer that question.

When Marlon learned of his sister's co-dependent adoration and that she was framing him for the murder (in order to lock him away so that only she could see him), he kills himself.\n\nThe two cases are just the final straws for Sara -- she leaves Las Vegas, and she leaves Grissom.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nThe episode revolves around Sara's decision to leave Las Vegas.\n\nSara comes in from a scene and runs into Warrick, who is having trouble sleeping. So is Sara; Warrick says she's tough and that he's not worried about her. She finds blood on her boots and throws them away before going with Ronnie to her next scene.\n\nWhat looks like a home invasion turns out to be a domestic dispute. The husband and wife fought, leaving the wife with a knife stuck in her back. When the husband returns to the house, he assaults his wife, yelling at her. Sara appears completely numb as she watches the attack; she leaves the scene, saying there's nothing to be done. She says that they'll be back for the wife's corpse next month, or the husband's, or both.\n\nA college girl falls from a building, having been apparently thrown out a window from her room. One of the suspects in the case is Marlon West, brother of Hannah West. When Sara finds out, she insists on working the case, admitting to having kept some track of Hannah since the previous case. Unknown to Sara, Hannah transfered from Harvard to go to graduate school with her brother. During her interrogation, the girl causes Sara to lose her temper, by bringing up Sara's recent kidnapping.\n\nSara lets the case get to her, and when it turns out that Hannah killed the girl, Marlon's girlfriend, and framed him because she was in love with him, Marlon kills himself. Sara shows a photo of Marlon's suicide to Hannah, who breaks down.\n\nWhen Sara returns to the lab, she kisses Grissom in front of Hodges and the rest of the lab (he doesn't respond), cuts her name off her vest and puts it in Ronnie's locker. Then she takes her keys from her locker and throws the name-tag away, leaving the locker room for good. The only thing she takes with her is a picture of herself and Grissom from several years ago. When Grissom goes looking for her, he discovers that she's left the lab forever, leaving him a note.\n\n_Note: according to writer David Rambo, Sara's final note to Grissom was written by Jorja Fox herself.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is numb and unresponsive in a case of domestic violence.  \nSara kisses Grissom for the first time on screen.  \nSara says that she loves Grissom (in her note), and says that he is her 'one and only' on screen.  \nSara finally admits (in her note) that the kidnapping has affected her.\n\n Quotes\n\nBrown: Yeah, it's to help me sleep -- I've been having the hardest time lately.  \nSidle: Me too.  \nBrown: Well you're just coming off of grave after all these years, it takes a while to adjust.

(walks off)  \nSidle: (watching him leave) Thanks.  \n\n- -\n\nGrissom: The one that got away?  \nSidle: We're not supposed to let them get away, right?  \n\n- -\n\nGrissom: Look, I'm worried about you.  \nSidle: That just makes it worse. Look, I, I can't talk about this right now.  \n\n- -\n\nBrass: Well, he gave it a shot, but she's way out of his league.  \nSidle: She's out of mine, too.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: (her note to Grissom) Gil, you know I love you. I feel I've loved you forever. Lately... I haven't been feeling well. Truth be told, I'm tired. Out in the desert under that car that night I realized something, and&#8230; haven't been able to shake it. Since my father died, I've spent almost my entire life with ghosts. Even my close friends. And, out there in the desert it occurred to me, that it was time for me to bury them. I can't be like you. I'm so sorry. No matter how hard I try to fight it off, I'm left with the feeling that ... I have to go. I have no idea where I'm going, but I know I have to do this. If I don't, I'm afraid I'll self destruct, and worse, you'll be there to see it happen. Be safe. Know that I tried very hard to stay. Know that you're my one and only. I'll miss you with every beat of my heart. Our life together was the only home I've ever really had, I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love you, I always will. Goodbye.\n",

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nTold with the whispery voice-over of a little girl, Nick, Sara, Warrick and Greg delve into the tale of what appears to be a quadruple homicide with no bodies. The McBride family (mother, father, son and daughter) live a quiet life and are known in their community. When the local doctor calls in a 911 call, spotting blood on the floor, the local police are stunned at the amount of blood in the house. The CSIs determine (with Catherine's help in the lab) that the parents and the son were shot and thus caused the blood in the house, however of the youngest, daughter Cassie, there is only a shoe full of cough syrup.\n\nThe CSIs investigate the house, which has been ripped apart but nothing appeared to be stolen. In the basement, they find an indoor marijuana farm. Much of the dried pot was stolen. They also learn that the son was another entrepreneur, selling essays to the other kids in his grade. One of the prints matches a kid in ROTC, who turns out to have the pot in his car's trunk. The son told his classmates about the pot in order to be thought of as cool, but when they came over, his parents were still there. The three teenage boys shot the son and the father, and then the mother when she came down stairs.\n\nOne of the boys was sent to drug the daughter, but she poured the cough syrup into her shoe and faked it, dropping 'cubes' of [http://www.bubblicious.com/ Bubblicious] gum as a Gum Drop trail. The boys then took the family out on a boat and dumped them in the middle of the nearby lake. One of the boys didn't want to dump Cassie, as she wasn't dead, and another boy slit her throat.\n\nCassie, however, was alive and managed to swim to shore, where she was found by Nick and thus able to speak (in whispers) and give us the voice-over for the episode.\n\n =Notes=\n\nAs originally written, the team was supposed to spend the night at a hotel since they were so far out of town; during the night Gil Grissom (unable to sleep because of Greg's snoring) goes to Sara's room, and she lets him in. Three scenes were originally written for this, and the first had been filmed when Billy Petersen's nephew died and he had to leave the set for a week. The script was re-written, and the scenes were deleted. Several weeks after the episode aired, Your Tax Dollars at Work (YTDAW) posted what they purported to be the original scenes. In a TV Guide interview in February of 2006, Jorja confirmed the setup (if not these specific scenes), saying that in the fifth episode ('Gum Drops'), Sara was supposed to sleep with Grissom.\n\nSara Sidle Review\n\nSara is the voice of reason and reality in this episode. When Nick blows up at a suspect, Sara gently calms him down and tells him she's worried about him. When Nick is too obsessive that the little girl is still alive, she reminds him of the odds.\n\nIn the beginning, Sara is called by Grissom (who's giving a lecture) to provide backup for Nick and brings Nick some coffee. She determines the crime must have happened somewhere between Friday night and Saturday morning, based on the gold stars Cassie should have received for her Saturday chores. After processing the house, Sara follows bloody footprints from the kitchen and discovers the marijuana farm in the basement. Sara also questions the doctor who called 911, pegging him correctly as being there to pick up his Mary Jane fix. It's Sara who finally gets the last teenager to admit to the crime, calmly asking him if he felt like man, killing a little girl.\n\nThrough the whole episode, Sara is solid and a good criminalist, on her top form. She tells Nick that in their job, it may not be best to hope that they find people alive. She also says that when it's your time to die, it's just your time. She remains cool and controlled throughout the case.\n\n Character Notes\n\nSara is very accepting of the fact that children die, which possibly reflects on her mother having killed her father.\nSara appears non-committal when talking with Greg about gold stars and childhood, but then finds the marijuana in the basement.\n\nQuotes\n\nSidle: Grissom said you needed backup. I figured you needed coffee. But it looks like you took care of that.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I was really into gold stars when I was a kid.  \nSanders: As opposed to now?  \nSidle: (frowns and walks away)  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I hope you're right. But everything in our experience tells us they're dead, all four of them.  \nStokes: Doesn't mean we just give up.  \nSidle: No one's giving up. It's just that ... you're acting like you're going to rescue a person, not recover a body. And on this job ... that's just not usually the case.  \nStokes: (quietly) I was rescued.  \nSidle: (smiles) It was not your day to die. When it's your day, it's your day, you know?",

The wife was beaten so badly, her internal organs liquified.\n\nFinn and Nick suspect the husband, and when they find bloody a warmup suit and hockey shaft with the logo of Jack's team, they're sure it's him. They track down the team's equipment manager to a former enforcer for Lou Gedda: the man who got Warrick killed. The enforcer rolls over onto Jack, with a recording that Jack tried to hire him to kill someone. Just as all the evidence points to Jack, Finn realizes he couldn't have done it. The brutal attack on the wife took more upper body strength than Jack has, because he's suffering from ALS. Jack was framed.\n\nDonny Price, a mid level drug distributor, was also killed, and was likely the real target. Price was selling drugs to Jack's wife, who was a police informant. And the bullet used was from former Sheriff Jeffery McKeen's gun. The gun used to kill Warrick.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nA woman, Mrs. Santiago, who suffers from a condition called 'hording' becomes a murder suspect when a dead body is found buried under piles of trash and debris inside her home. Initially the cops are called in due to complaints of too many cats (and the resultant smell), but when they can't get in the front door, the case takes a turn for the worse and a liquified body is found. Initially they think the body is Mrs. Santiago, but it's her daughter, Diana.\n\nDiana had been dead a week, from a single blow to the head caused by an object in the house. Inspecting the house the CSIs find a blood trail to a room where things had been tidied up considerably. Diana had come over to help her mother clean the house, when a stack of magazine hit her in the head, falling from a tall tower, and a second body, the skeleton of a 17 year old male, is found, his hands bound with red ribbon.\n\nIn the backyard, the skeletonized remains of three more boys of a similar age are found in a pit, covered by a tarp. Their hands tied in front with red ribbon. All four died of acute arsenic poisoning. They were runaways who were sent to a halfway house run by Julian Santiago, the eldest child.\n\nAlisia, the middle child, is found still in the house, walled up behind boxes of her own belongings, handcuffed to her own crib by her mother. The handcuffs were bought by Julian, but only Mrs. Santiago and Alisia's prints are found in the room.\n\nAfter mother and son lawyer up, they go back to the red ribbon and are able to create a timeline of the murders. After they find the ribbon and arsenic, they determine Alisia was seducing the boys from her brother's halfway home and killing them. She blames her mother for her insanity.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nNick and Sara answer the call and are the first to enter the house. When Nick steps in body goo, Sara teases him. They also argue like siblings about interpretations of the evidence and the causes of Level 5 hoarding. Sara is very sympathetic where Nick is not, and Sara leaves the crime scene to process Mrs. Santiago. Sara tells Greg that she feels like Nick doesn't get that this hoarding was caused by a trauma.\n\nNick and Sara argue more about who's at fault: the son or the mother. Nick blames the mother, Sara the son. After fighting with Nick, Sara walks out on Ray when he tries to tell Sara he's been where she's been.\n\nIn the end, she tells Julian about her mother's schizophrenia, and that you can move on.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara handles crazy people really well  \nSara is very kind and sympathetic to Mrs. Santiago\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: How could someone live like this?  \nSidle: Well. It smells like someone died like this.  \n\n* *\n\nStokes: What is it about this case that makes you so blind?  \nSidle: What is it about this case that makes you act like an ass?  \nStokes: Oh! I'm an ass, now!?  \n\n* *\n\nSidle: My mother was schizophrenic. On night, she got a butcher knife out of a drawer. She walked into the bedroom and while my father was sleeping, she stabbed him in the heart. Again and again. To say that my childhood was screwed up is an understatement. But. I survived it. Just like you did. You and your sister grew up together in that house, and you took two completely different paths. Sometimes when we're faced with crimes that are so incomprehensible, we want answers. We want to believe that there's some order to things. Sometimes there just isn't.\n\n",

Raped in the very condo building she worked and lived in, Christina had been tied to her bed by duct tape and assaulted by Richard McQueen, a man posing as a fireman. The rapist's MO was to light smoke bombs in the building, knock on the door of a woman, knock her out with the lorazepam and to rape her over hours, multiple times. Additionally, Richard had a foot fetish.\n\nAt some point during the rape, Christina's quasi-boyfriend came by with flowers, but when he found the door was locked and heard Barry White playing, he assumed she'd moved on and threw the flowers down in a huff.  \nChristina was unable to remember a great number of details, but said she didn't paint her nails, which were currently painted ruby red.\n\nit's via the trace evidence of a scrap of cloth from Richard's fireman uniform that the CSIs can pin the disguise down. But the outfit isn't a perfect match to the materials used by the Las Vegas Fire Department, and quickly it's determined the fake-fireman is also the same man who set smoke bombs in another apartment building. As it turns out, that was a smoke test, as Richard was seeing how well his disguise worked. His first 'attack' had been on a woman whom he'd spied from his balcony, doing yoga on her own balcony. A month previously, he'd met her at a bar, drugged her, took her home and given her a pedicure.\n\nIn Richard's apartment, all the evidence needed to pin him to the crimes was there, except Ricard. He was busy setting the smoke bombs for his next victim. The fourth and final victim he killed, because she wouldn't let him touch her feet. The real firemen caught Richard trying to flee, and proceeded to beat the shit out of him.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nIt's not surprising that Sara has a strong dislike to rape. When asked if her following a lead on a cold case is as helpful as another rape victim, in terms of finding evidence, Sara says she'd rather it not come to that.",

The latest slaying matches Millander's previous killings in that it recreates his father's murder, which Millander witnessed as a boy. In each case, the victim is shot once through the chest while lying in a bathtub. A nearby tape recorder contains the person's supposed suicide message.\n\nAll three victims share the same birthday of Aug. 17--the date Millander's father was slain--with the years in descending order from 1959. So presumably, the killer's next target was born Aug. 17, 1956...which just happens to be Grissom's birthday.\n\nGrissom realizes that Millander could be after him next. Tracing speeding tickets issued to Millander's victims, the team learns that all of them were issued tickets through the same court. To their surprise, Grissom and Catherine discover Paul Millander, serving as a judge under the name Douglas Mason. In an effort to prove he is not Paul Millander, Mason invites Grissom to dinner where he claims his fingerprints will prove his innocence.\n\nGrissom and Catherine also track down Isabelle Millander and discover a hand print belonging to Paul Millander's deceased father.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nUnlike the last time Grissom was mentioned in the lab , this time everyone is angry at Grissom because of Lady Heather. However they allow him in the room when Heather is interrogated.\n\nShe claims there was an intruder in her home whom she attacked and then ran off, not calling the cops because of recent experiences. Heather needles Sara until Sara breaks and leaves the room, promising to get Heather. It's Heather who says 'you mean him', indicating Grissom. Heather explains that while she's certainly the 'cause' for the killings, she's not behind them. She's being framed by one of the thirteen people who had a key to her special room.\n\nOf the thirteen people, only five are male and alive. They include Dalton Barrow, Heather's first client. But none of their blood matches. As they mull that over, Lindsey Willows brings in Grissom's suitcase. Only it's not Grissom's. It's a dead body in a suitcase. In the body is a MicroSD card with a video message for Grissom. All the killings are being done for him.\n\nThe body is identified as Jacob Wolfowitz, the man who killed Heather's daughter. While they manage to clear Heather as the person in the video, she's still detained as a suspect while the CSIs hunt down more evidence, but all they find is Mr. Synthetic Cadaver with a bee in him.\n\nGrissom and Sara study the bee, which Grissom thinks was planted just for him. He sends out sniffer bees to find the where the bee in the fake body came from, and hopefully find the killer: Dalton Barron.\n\nMeanwhile D.B. Russell tracks down the prints from the cadaver and sends Catherine, Greg, and Morgan Brody off to collect the man: Dalton Barron. The trio don't make it out there, finding bombs in their cars instead. Catherine is able to help everyone defuse the car bombs safely.\n\nDalton's entire apartment is wired to blow, and as Grissom and Sara find him in the forest, so is he. Somehow he managed to trick them with his DNA. Since Dalton is dying of lymphoma, the blood he left at the scene matches his stem cell treatment, not his bucal swab. Dalton's motive was because Grissom ruined Heather, taking her away from him. Grissom is able to talk him into delaying, disconnecting his suicide vest.\n\nAs the case closes, Russell leaves for the Cyber team while Catherine returns to Las Vegas and Sara gets the Director's position. Grissom heads back out to the ocean and Heather is free to go. Before she does, Grissom thanks Heather for opening his heart so he could love.\n\nAs Sara leaves for San Diego, she leaves her director's badge for Catherine. In the end, she chooses Grissom.\n\nEnd of Series\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara is anything but happy to see Heather, and blows up at Grissom. She keeps it together until the interrogation, and has to leave then. Catherine calls her out on still being in love with Grissom, but admits she herself would like to kill Heather too. Heather asks Sara if she loves Grissom, and Sara admits she still does.\n\nWhile still smarting over Heather, Sara apologizes to Grissom and asks if they can be friends, to which he agrees. They work on the bees together, just like old times.\n\nIn the end, Sara gets the position she wants but refuses to say goodbye to Grissom. They're two ships passing in the night. When Grissom thanks Heather, he says his heart belongs to one woman, meaning Sara, she hears all but the end. Meaning she doesn't know that until she reads the transcript of Heather's final interview with Grissom.\n\nAnd she gives it all up for Grissom, sailing off into the ocean with him.\n\nCharacter Notes \n\nSara is promoted to Lab Director (the role Grissom had in season one)  \nSara chooses Grissom in the end.\n\nQuotes\nSara Sidle Lady Heather, as much as I'd like to roll out the voluntary red carpet and welcome you here to your own bombing party, I can't find it in my bone marrow to overrule my gut.

When Haskell turns his back for a moment, Ray jumps him, disarms him, and brutally punches him into submission. Even bound, Haskell antagonizes Ray about what he did to Gloria, until Ray cuts the plastic cuffs off and they fight to the death. Brass is first on the scene, and takes in the now dead Haskell's wrists. Noting the marks left by department issue plastic cuffs, Brass runs upstairs to find Ray and Gloria, alive.\n\nBrass does his best to help Ray, knowing that IA will be all over it, implying to the CSIs that they should help out as well. The evidence found in the house implies that both Thorpes, father and son, were killers. Buried in the backyard is a number of animals, and the body of Haskell's mother and the real Douglas Nathan Haskell. The mother was killed by Arvin Thorpe.\n\nAfter Sara determines that there are no flex cuffs at the scene, and all three standard issue are still in Ray's kit, they all sign the investigation to say that the killing was in self defense. When Catherine goes to tell Brass, however, she implies that it was Brass who restored the third set of flex cuffs to Ray's kit, covering for him. Brass points out he protects his guys.\n\nWhile the CSI's found the killing to be justified, Brass tells Ray that he knows what really happened, but points out that both Ray and Brass will go to jail if they tell anyone. Because Brass picked up the cut flex cuff and hid it from the CSIs.\n\nThe episode ends on Ray's IA interview, being asked if the killing (which Ray admits he is guilty of) was is self-defense or murder.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Greg are the first CSIs on the scene, just in time to see Ray and Gloria driven away in a squad car. Sara takes the lead at the house, working with Greg to collect evidence from the multitude of blood samples in the stairwell, but also the room where Gloria was kept and the master bedroom, where decades old blood is found.\n\nSara reads the evidence accurately right away, concluding the facts promptly, regardless of her friendship with Ray. She tells Catherine that Ray dominated the fight, had him off his feet, and threw him through the banister to his death. Catherine shows Sara the evidence that Haskell was bound, which he was not at the time of his death, and no flex cuffs were found at the scene. Sara checks Ray's kit for the standard three department issued cuffs (which are there), but Greg asks if it was him, would Sara still have looked in his kit.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is determined to show the truth in the evidence, and not color the facts for Ray's benefit.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Shoot, sample, sort.\n\n* *\n\nSidle: We can't talk to [Langston and Gloria] until after they talk to I.A., but we can let the walls talk to us.\n\n* *\n\nSidle: Nate Haskell may have died in this house, but I think a serial killer was born in this room.\n\n* *\n\nSanders: If it was me, my kit...  \nSidle: I'd open it. We have all had a moment in the dark, where we had to fight our way out, and when we did, it was up to the rest of the team to shine a light on that darkness to see what happened. That's our job.

As one may not guess, it was a private auction for rare wine, held at the Vogel mansion. In the wine celler, some expensive wine is revealed to a party goer, who says heâll pay anything for it. Of course, that doesnât work out when the seller is found dead in a wine barrel, shot at by some young punks in an alley, well decomposed and grotesque. No ID was found, save cufflinks with the initials 'JD,' and was killed by a small calliblar gunshot. His last meal of whale sushi was served by a cook who was regularly known to have served whale sushi at the home of Albert Vogel. Vogel ID's the cufflinks as belonging to Jack Davari, and notes that he argued with Marc Ratelle recently.\n\nRatelle, while the CSIs are looking into his background, breaks into Vogel's wine celler and smashes all of the wine of the same kind he'd intended to buy from Davari. Turns out the wine in Vogel's was all faked, and Ratelle destroyed it. The CSIs prove this when the MassSpec detects radioactive isotopes in the supposed 1930s wine. Ratelle has an alibi, as does the person who bought the wine, Dr. Jonah Drake.\n\nIt turns out Davari had been mass producing fakes of expensive wines, with the help of Tom Scolla, a 'security' guard to regularly transports expensive wines. The two had been faking the wines for three years, and claimed to have had Drake on the hook for more. Scolla, however, as an alabi: he was at a club. Interestingly, Scolla had given bone marrow to a cancer victim, his sister, who happened to be newly engaged to Jonah Drake. Samantha Wilson (nee Scolla) was in on the grift as well, but had fallen in love with Drake, and murdered Davari over an argument trying to get out.\n\nMeanwhile, Mac Taylor visits from New York to surprise his girlfriend, in Vegas on business, only to find her mising, her hotel room tossed, and blood trace left everywhere. \n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Greg work the primary case of the wine.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is still wearing her wedding ring, regardless of her talk with Grissom.   \nNormally Sara is a soft touch for sob stories, but this time had no sympathy for Samantha.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle:: Black tie.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nThe case of two high school students, one dead and one missing, lead the CSIs into the underbelly of streetcar racing and a tangled web of deadly competition.\n\nTrevor Beck, a high school senior, dropped dead in the school hallway for no obvious cause. In the autopsy, they determine it was caused by cerebral menigina, however there was no injury sufficient to cause the damage. His girlfriend, Cindy Warner, has also gone missing. Cindy used to date Miyamoto Takahachi, whom Trevor punched in a fight over her.\n\nTrevor died of an undiagnosed malformation of his brain stem which, when he was injured, caused his brain to swell. In addition, he was taking anti-depressants and an MAO inhibitor (given to him by his best friend), which worsened the condition. Cindy is found dead outside of town, thanks to the GPS on Trevor's car. While her body appears to be dumped, there's no evidence to how she ended up in the desert. In fact, she was hit by a car driving so fast, she was thrown the length of a football field.\n\nUnknown to his friends, Trevor had started to race his car at the police sanctioned 'Street Rumble' and had been scraped by a yellow car. The car is tracked down to a street racing group called the Demons, one of whom is Mitch. However, Trevor had a classic car and only raced against other classics, and happened to beat Cindy's best friend and locker mate, Renata Clarke, in a race. In that race, Trevor suffered whiplash, which caused his brain stem to crack and his brain to swell.\n\nRenata got Cindy, her BFF, to 'borrow' Trevor's car so Renata could race it against her own car, driven by Gus, her uncle and guardian, in an illegal street race to prove that Trevor's car was better than Renata's. During the race, Gus accidentally hit, and killed, Cindy. Afterword, Renata and Gus take the car to the Demons, who part out the damaged parts and replace and repair.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara goes to the high school to find Trevor's girlfriend, Cindy, and works with Nick in processing Trevor's car. Later, working with Hodges, Sara determines how Cindy died, recognizing the injuries on her legs from previous experiences .\n\nWhen investigating the race, Sara flirts with the boys, talking about cars, in order to get a better look at the car. While she appeared ignorant of the 'sacrilegious' nature of putting an electric engine in a 1968 classic, she is knowledgeable or at least able to recall the information determined from the evidence.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is an environmentalist.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: Putting an electric motor in this [car] is sacrilegious.  \nSidle: Not a polar bears.\n\n* *\n\n",

While waiting for the suspect's car to be brought in from impound, Sara talks to Nick about why she hates certain cases taking priority over others; he already knows that 'lots of things' piss her off. Sara's frustration shows when the suspect's car arrives -- flat as a pancake. Sara and Nick unflatten the car, and discover a parking permit inside. Sara has Grissom pin her against the victim's sheet (which she apparently enjoys) to demonstrate her theory of the crime, then tries to talk to him about the promotion she's put in for, wondering if their relationship will affect her chances at getting the position. Grissom says nothing, Sara stumbles over her words, then stops and walks off.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nOne of the very rare times where Sara talks back to Grissom or protests an assignment.   \nSara doesn't like high-visibility cases taking precedence over other cases.  \nSara worries that her relationship with Grissom might affect her chances at the promotion.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Uh, listen, I recognize the importance of this, but I'm in the middle of my own homicide investigation.  \nGrissom: I'll talk to your detective.

It appears Alison was killed due to her research into the Vegas good-old-boy crime network, concerning the death of Ledo Wright, a pianist. Matters become more convoluted when the piano containing her body was that of Ledo's.\n\nBack in the sixties, a man named Tommy Grazetti killed Ledo Wright to get in with Sinatra and his Rat Pack. Only the truth is that Ledo assumed Tommy's identity. While everyone assumes he killed Tommy, it wasn't true. Tommy died, choking on his food, and Ledo assumed his identity so as not to go to war in Vietnam.\n\nVinyl tracings found on Alison's body are traced back to a rare Sinatra record, which was purchased by a Sinatra impersonator at Tommy/Ledo's Rat Pack club. Alison had bought the record for Greg. The Frank Sinatra impersonator, a little off his rocker, killed her over it and dumped her in the piano, which was picked up for it's scheduled maintenance, and then dumped in the desert by the terrified driver.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara was mostly in the background this episode.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara listens to Radiohead.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: If it were a Radiohead song, I could help you.\n\n",

Catherine becomes convinced that a 6-year-old girl's death was no accident when she and Sara examine a crime scene inside the Tunnel of Love ride at an amusement park.\n\n Sara Sidle Review## \n\nSara and Catherine work the case of a kid found dead in the Tunnel of Love at a traveling carnival. The victim is a six year old girl, and Sara shows concern for Catherine, asking her if she's okay with it; Catherine replies by asking Sara to interview the mother. In checking the background of the carnival, Sara discovers that it has numerous safety violations, more than half of its employees have criminal records and the ride operator is a convicted sex offender out on parole.\n\nSara takes Catherine to task for being aggressive in questioning the suspect, something that Catherine has done (and will do with her). When Catherine gets aggressive, no one questions it, but when Sara gets aggressive, they yell at her.

Curiously, his injury starts to heal the fractured relationship between him and his daughter, Morgan.\n\nNick, drunk and belligerent, is beat up and arrested, and thrown in the drunk tank, before he returns to work. While he works the case, he doesn't decide if he wants to come back to work or not by the end of the episode.\n\nOutside the Russell house, Sara finds an LVPD flashlight, as well as trace that links the kidnappers to an older building. Not being able to trust the majority of the police now, the CSIs resort to only using personell vetted by Brass. Finn is taken by one of the corrupt cops to a club where they're holding Russell's granddaughter in the back. She attempts to sneak Katie out through the air ducts, while staying behind to fight the kidnapper's henchmen and buy her time. This nearly ends terribly for Finn, and only the timely arrival of LVPD saves her. Katie, meanwhile, is re-captured. The CSIs track down the evidence to a house in the desert, where they find Katie and her kidnappers.\n\nWhile the case concludes well, Russell is left with a lingering fear that his wife will leave him over his work, and the inherent dangers.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nAfter texting Finn to inform her about Russell's granddaughter, Sara is on hand for when Ecklie is loaded into the ambulance.

She drafts him back to work for the case. Nick helps Sara work through the evidence, including the note left at the scene, which reveals the fingerprint of Lt. Paul Kimball, McKeen's number one guy and the kidnapper.\n\nAs the episode ends, Nick, Sara, and Greg are sitting in the break room again, just as they did in the season twelve finale.

While she does not appear to be missing anything, she is found dead on the side of the road by the airport, seemingly having been thrown from a fast moving vehicle.

When he takes her phone, she decks him and runs off.\n\nJanet Riggins' ID turns out to be fake, and her phone a throw-away burner. After landing, she called Jefferson Nalley, a local janitorial serviceman, who IDs her as Heather Morrison. Hank Gardener, an elderly man on the flight, turns out to be the thief, who says Heather had a bag full of Benjamins, and was the victim of abuse (a fact that the autopsy confirms). Her abusive husband comes to the morgue to see his wife's body, and is abusive towards Doc Robbins, saying that Nalley was to blame. Of course Nalley blames Mr. Morrison and explains he connected Heather with 'the Wolf' who was going to help her disappear. Heather had not yet paid 'the Wolf' and when she'd been robbed by Hank, had reason to worry.\n\nThe ID was made at a company that Nalley's janitorial service cleaned for on Fridays, which allows the CSIs to track down all the purchases to Jefferson Nalley. The stoner kids ID Nalley's van, placing him at the body dump site. Nalley confesses there was no 'wolf.' It was all him, and when he told Heather, she freaked out.

Karl shoots and kills Clayton in retribution, after Nash contacts him as a part of the 12-step process to cure one's self of dependency. As Karl makes his escape, meticulous enough to not even leave a stray cigarette butt, he is broadsided by a drunk young woman named Ally Sullivan. Hoping to avoid the police, Karl tries to talk Ally out of calling them, but she does so anyway. Or at least she starts to, when Karl breaks her neck, leaving her for dead.\n\nBack at home, Karl shaves his beard and tries to keep it secret from his wife, Janice, who knows of his bank robber past and the reason he served time. Karl follows the case of Ally via the television and feels some measure of guilt for the death of an innocent. He goes so far as to leave cash for Ally's father, by way of apology. When he feels the CSIs are getting close, Karl asks his lawyer (who is a lawyer for many former and current criminals) for supplies from which Karl can forge a new identity. Janice finds these and confronts Karl, who admits to killing Nash. While Janice understands the killing of Nash, she is horrified that Karl killed Ally and kicks him out. The next day, the CSIs come to Janice's home and threaten to take away their daughter. Upon finding this out, Karl turns himself in.\n\nAs for the CSIs, they appear to play catch-up for much of the case. They have little evidence, and it's not until they find matching fibers on Ally and Nash that they're able to link the cases and determine the killer. The car leads them to a used car lot where a blurry photocopy of Karl is their only lead. Checking the bus routes, they find the bus driver who recognizes Karl, and gives the stop he boarded the bus from. That stop turns out to be on an ATV route, where the CSIs find a burnt pile of clothes, including the gloves which left fibers at Ally and Nash's crime scene. The ATV tracks are particular enough to lead the CSIs to Janice. Also, the palm print Karl left on Ally's car links them to him, and the same last name between Janice and Karl is enough for a warrant, especially since Karl's record lists Janice, under her maiden name, as a visitor in prison.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nThere is very little character development in this episode, as the majority of the story is told from Karl's perspective. Sara's best work comes when she tracks the bus routes that may have taken Karl to where he bought the car, which turns up a very attentive bus driver.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nN/A\n\n Quotes## ",

Dancing with handsome men and dolling out advice to the younger set. So it's surprising when one of her waiters, Tim Duke, is found dead by her assistant later that night and Lois is nowhere to be seen. When the assistant, Eve Girard, is asked to open the closet/safe, Lois is found cowering within, and evidence points to her being shot at as she went to hide.\n\nLois admits she often comes up to change during parties (one dress for greeting, one for diner and dancing, and one for desert). She'd offered Tim the job because he needed the money. When she came up to change, someone shot him and tried to shoot her, so she locked herself in the closet. Lois claims she's a suspect because of the tell-all book she wrote. Greg is smitten and asks for her autograph. Lois' driver, Bob Jensen, used to drive for her boyfriend, Tony C. (who vanished ala Jimmy Hoffa), refuses to talk about anything.\n\nSara and David Phillips check out the body. Two shots and a lot of money in his pocket, as well as an empty crack vial. Sara goes to tell Catherine, who explains that her mother was a back-up dancer for Lois. Nick collects the security cameras and information about all the people at the party, which includes the Sheriff and Sam Braun, Catherine's father.\n\nIn attendance also is pop star Li'l Cherry, who left the room when the killing happened. The Sheriff orders Grissom to let everyone who didn't leave the room to be let go. Cherry makes a scene and tries to run off before grissom can search her bag. Of course they do and find a crack pipe. At the interrogation, the point out that the victim had a crack pipe, and so did Cherry. Cherry denies involvement with the shooting.\n\nSara and Greg find millions in cash under the floor. Lois says she didn't know it was there, but Eve says she knew about it. The coroner determines that Tim was shot and killed by a bullet through the heart, dying instantly, and then shot again ten minutes later in the head, contrary to what Lois said.\n\nSara, Greg and Warrick discuss possibilities for the murder of ex boxer and petty thief, Tim Duke. Greg speculates the money is stolen from a 'famous' Pan-Am heist in 1965, and that Tony C. left the money for Lois. One possibility for the murder is that he was a hit man, hired to kill Lois. Another is that Tony hired Tim to protect Lois because of the book. A third is that Lois herself was the killer. Catherine and Sara go to check her dinner dress for GSR but the dress is missing. Sara finds the ring instead and it is, indeed, positive for GSR, and the gun used to kill Tim matches the one from the Pan-Am flight.\n\nWhen Brass and Grissom go to check on Lois about the mater, they find her dead, shot in her own bed. Lois was already dying of tumors, and Bob confesses the rest. Lois had tried to cover up Tim's death. She'd hired him to plan this last bash and then kill her, so she could die pretty at the party, instead of a dried up old bag in the hospital. But Tim had tried to steal from her, and she shot him with Tony's gun, the same gun he'd used to steal from Pan-Am years ago. With Tim dead, Lois asked Bob to kill her so she could die with a little dignity.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara is highly amused by Greg's obsession with Lois and her history. She's only spot on the mark, picking out the ring after she and Catherine find the dress is missing.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara likes men with a little grey hair.\n\n Quotes\n\nSanders: The Benjamins took the bullet!  \nSidle: In God We Trust.  \n\n- -\n\nHodges: I like my grey hairs.

The only problem? He was in the elevator alone. His friend (and virtual neice) Eva Rendell, the only woman left in the PPC, was at the hotel with Coe, but left before he got on the elevator. David Hodges solves the locked room mystery by determining the killer threw a playing card (the Ace of Spades) to slice Coe's throat as the doors closed. The card was part of a special set of cards made by the Palemro for the 1997 Classic that Coe won. \n\nTrent Aldridge is found dead in a hotel, tied up spread eagle, and died by asphyxiation, choking on some food. While Aldridge checked in alone, he had clearly been up to some sexual shenanigans, and one the hotel staff was tipped by his partner with a poker chip. Seven raw chicken hearts (seven of hearts) were forced fed to Aldridge while tied up. In addition, Aldridge held a high-stakes poker game every week and played against Coe in 1997.\n\nChicken blood was also found on the playing card used to kill Coe. The conicidences send the CSIs to look at old cases, where they find Ed Ficelli, a pit boss of the Palermo, who OD'd two months prior. The herion in his system had been poisioned, and the pattern of injections form a perfect match for a Four of Clubs. The prints on the poker chip that Aldridge's dominatrix gave as a tip match Eva Rendell. When they go to find Rendell, she's been beheaded in her hotel room by a mideval war hammer aka a poleaxe (King of Diamonds).\n\nBo Madison was the third player in 1997, when they were dealt the 'death' hand: Ace of Spades, seven of hearts, four of clubs, King of Diamonds, and King of Spades. Madison has been dead for years, of suicide, so Greg watches the tape of the final match over and over until he determines that Aldrige and Coe were colluding with the dealer to beat Madison. The dealer was Eva Rendell's father, and also died years prior. Ficelli was the ringleader of the scam.\n\nAll of this ties back to magician, Dr. Jimmy, who loaned Coe $4000 to get into the PPC, is an expert at throwing cards, had a poleaxe, and skipped town shortly after being held on obstruction of justice. Jimmy had funded the scammers, and was in turn nearly killed by Bo Madison's daughter: His lovely assistant, Kathy Hill.

The former course record holder (now held by his son, Danny Nagano), Russell was an antagonistic drunk who was angry towards his son Danny, his ex-wife and many other people.\n\nRussell's ex-wife's sister, Erin, left her prints on a ball found in his golf cart. She buys the balls every time Danny, her step-nephew, plays a tournament. Danny's caddy's prints were also found on the balls, and John Dudek was a former professional golfer, kicked out of the sport for being caught using performance enhancing drugs by none other than Russell Huntley.\n\nRussell dropped a $5000 bet against his son, the day Danny broke the course record, and Russell suspected him of cheating. The CSIs determine that the density of Danny's balls had been altered by his step-aunt, Erin, who works with lasers at UNLV, at the behest of John Dudek, the caddy. Danny had never known about the tampering. When they find Russell's golf bag, they determine he was testing the balls on an unused portion of the golf course, and find evidence that his murderer attacked him there.\n\nDanny admits that he met his father there, to demonstrate that he was capable, but Russell proved to him about the juiced balls. Russell urged Danny to turn himself in, but Danny just walked away as his step-mother, Michelle, drove up and then away. In the end, the death was determined to be accidental. Russell had been banging the golf club on the ground, and the head snapped, bouncing and stabbing him in the neck, severing an artery.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works with recovering evidence from the golf cart with Ray and Nick, and is somewhat disparaging about golf in general. Later, she and Greg go to investigate the primary crime scene, and Greg questions, friendly-like, the validity of Sara's marriage to Grissom. In turn, Sara momentarily pretends that it was a joke.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara isn't a fan of golf.  \nSara and Greg are still sibling-comfortable around each other.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: Each [golf ball] is unique.  \nSidle: Awww. Just like a snowflake!\n\n* *:\n\nSanders: Sometimes I wonder if you two are really married.  \nSidle: Well ... Now that you mention it ...

Ronny's head was sawn off by hand and transported in a bag used by Kevin X, one of the players in the tournament, who had also lost to Ronny in a pick-up game. Blood spatter and the rest of Ronny's body, indicates that Ronny was shot at the employment of his homeless friend, Vitas.\n\nWhile the CSIs suspect Vitas, when they review camera footage they determine Ronny's girlfriend, Shea Lammet, is a suspect as they can place her at the pinsetter, where the head was inserted into the ball feed.\n\nShea was cheating on Ronny with Chevy Cigs, the other bowler in the tournament, and he accuses her of the killing. When Ronny's blood is found in the finger holes of Chevy's ball, the CSIs are certain he's involved. The game picks up two days later, and Chevy is arrested at the game, but not before he defeats Kevin X.\n\nThe original plan was for Shea to lure Chevy to the supplier where Vitas worked, and for Ronny to scare him. Instead, Chevy shot Ronny and coerced Shea into helping him cover up the crime. Shea put the head in the ball feed to give Chevy something he'd never forget, as payback for dumping her.\n\nRay works a case of a suicide in jail of a woman, Carla York, who claims she was innocent of killing her husband, James.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nFourteen year-old Will Sutter is found dead in the field, his body dumped, with snacks, a pocket knife, and a compass. The case takes an off turn when the blood under Will's nails was that of Simon Rose, a man Sara put in jail two and a half years ago.\n\nSimon was accused and convicted him of murdering his wife. He choked her to death on the kitchen floor, while he claimed to be asleep upstairs. Simon's nose was broken, and there were scratches on his face, belying his claims. His lawyer uses the blood as reason to argue for an appeal, claiming that the blood proves someone else was guilty of the crime.\n\nSara goes to the evidence locker to see if the blood was taken from there, while Ray goes to visit Simon in jail to see if he has any cuts where blood was drawn. George, the head custodian of central evidence, knows non-public details about the case, and his car has proof that Will was transported inside it.\n\nGeorge claims that Will was snooping around in evidence, including the Simon/Samantha Rose case's box, when he fell and accidentally died. Afraid that Will compromised evidence, he transported the body. The CSIs find blood at the crime scene, backing up George's story, but also finding that Will was looking for the Rose case file.\n\nWhen his self-professed 'former' best friend, Mason, is determined to be an accomplice in Will's break-in of central evidence, Brass investigates only to find Mason with his head bashed in on the floor of his own bedroom. In addition, the card of Simon Rose's lawyer is found in Mason's room. The lawyer claims Mason tried to extort her for information, as he knew that Will broke in on a dare.\n\nMason had asked Will to break in because he and Steve, Will's other former best friend, had been partying and drinking underage in an abandoned house. They'd accidentally started a fire, and when the CSIs had collected the evidence, they asked Will, smart Will, to help them. But Mason wrote down the wrong evidence box and Will died. When Mason didn't seem to care about Will's death, Steve bashed him in the head with a bat.\n\nAnd Simon Rose remained in jail.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nPerceptively noticing that he looks ill, Sara admits to Steve, Will's former best friend, that she drank when she was younger, to try and be cool. When Steve vomits, Sara correctly deduces he'd been drinking tequila.\n\nSara commiserates with the man working at central evidence that this sort of case, where the rich man goes free, is one of the cases that caused her to quit CSI and go to Costa Rica. They review the evidence together to ensure it wasn't tampered with. While leaving, Sara notices George's car matches the description of the one that dumped Will and investigates it, only to find evidence that Will was in the trunk.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara mentions she used to drink. \n\n Quotes## \n\n",

Later, Catherine learns that being the boss isn't all it's cracked up to be when she has to reprimand Warrick for what she deems unprofessional behavior.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara consoles Greg at the scene, wondering if he's okay. She gets confrontational with the child's aunt, who was supposed to be looking after them. When Sara is talking to the foster kids, we learn that she was in the foster system herself, 'for a while'.

The results of this tactic prove deadly. Catherine learned last year that he's her dad after comparing her DNA with his blood when he was a murder suspect, and unwittingly helped him beat that charge. He later gave her a hefty check, which she cashed. Now Sam is again wanted for homicide when a man caught cheating at one of his casinos ends up dead. Grissom immediately dismisses Catherine from the case, but she finds it hard to stay away. Also, Nick gets the promotion that Sara coveted, but the position is recinded due to budget cuts.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara is stunned when she learns that Grissom recommended Nick for the promotion instead of her. When she confronts Grissom about it, he says that he doesn't have a problem with her, but that he recommended Nick because he didn't want the position; Sara is unhappy and more than a little disappointed about that.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nIn the garage when they're discussing the promotion, Sara lets the tape measure snap back -- an interesting Freudian response.  \nSara is quite comfortable working with Warrick, which is in sharp contrast to her attitude towards him when she first arrived in Vegas.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: (waves letter in his hand) This is about the key CSI position.

Meanwhile, Sara reopens a cold case in which a colleague's husband was murdered, but the killer was never caught. Sara is troubled with personal ties, as her colleague has a potentially fatal affliction. Grissom's hearing further deteriorates.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara stops by court to visit a wheelchair-bound prosecutor friend of hers, Melissa Winters -- who tells Sara that she'll be dead soon. Winters was crippled when someone broke into her home, killed her husband and shot her. Sara talks with Doc Robbins about the upcoming operation, and doesn't like what she hears -- however, the operation is a success, and Sara gets the bullet recovered from Winters. Ballistics finds a match (Dawson doesn't quite believe her when she says that she has Grissom's permission to reopen the case), and Sara tracks it to a convict serving time. He claims he found the gun in Winter's house when he broke in to trash it. Sara is upset by the lack of evidence in the old case file, and is shocked when she discovers that Winters lied... she shot her husband, and he managed to shoot her before he died. Sara confronts Winters, and is almost in tears as she leaves the hospital room. Later in the CSI locker room, she tells Grissom about her older brother, and disappointments.\n\n_Note: this is the only time that Sara's older brother is mentioned during the series.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara feels a close kinship with Winters, a tough prosecutor who has overcome adversity.  \nSara mentions her older brother smoked pot.  \nSara feels betrayed by her friend; to quote Jorja Fox, Sara is \"so sure she knows everything about someone\" that it's an emotional shock when she finds out different. \nThis is Sara's first (but not last big emotional shock of the season.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Melissa, we've been building this case together for six months.

Zoe is emaciated, branded with the number 19, her hair has been shaved off and her right hand chewed off.\n\nAt the autopsy, they determine one of her eyes was severed at the optic nerve, and Zoe had necrotizing faciitis, which had been injected into her blood stream causing her to rot from the inside out. Zoe had also been injected with a variety of drugs normally given to mental patients, and her severed eye belonged to a convited sex offender named Jack Londers. When found, Captain Jack appears to be less than sane, though he agrees to come to the ER, where the doctor says he was lobotomized via his empty eye socket.\n\nOnly after seeing her daughter's picture on the news does Lady Heather herself come and ID the body. She request anonymity from Brass, who keeps the information from the press, but tells Grissom. They go check out Zoe's apartment and find that she's still interested in psychology. Zoe had also been to the Betz Clinic, who said she was there for chronic insomnia. Both Zoe and Capt. Jack were in the same test group, and both left the study part way through the night.\n\nLady Heather confirms the body is Zoe's, and even though she is torn up, Gil questions her about Zoe. About a year ago, Zoe had dropped out of Harvard and stopped talking to her mother, though Lady Heather didn't want to elaborate.\n\nResults show that Zoe had eaten her own hand off, and the CSIs sweep the desert for her hand. Instead they found the house of Jacob Wolfwitz (from the Clinic), who happens to have a variety of genetically modified plants, including ones that smell like decomposing bodies. When they go to the door, however, it's Lady Heather who enters, having broken in. She explains to Grissom that she was hoping Wolfwitz would invite the cops in and they would find something probative. Instead, he dismisses the charges (never knowing it's Lady Heather or Zoe's mother), and Lady Heather whips out a manuscript she stole from his house, saying it was too expensive and must have been stolen.\n\nAs it turns out, the manuscript was stolen from the UNLV library, which is enough to get a warrent. Before they can act on it, Wolfwitz is found dead in his car, having been frozen solid at least two days before.\n\nThis sets everyone on edge, as the day before Catherine had interviewed Wolfwitz, and the evening before, Lady heather had slept with him. As she explains to Grissom, she needed a sample of his DNA for the CSIs. She also explains that Zoe had left Harvard because she'd gotten pregnant with her therapist's child. As he was married and a doctor, Lady Heather had his license revoked, which was when Lady Heather and Zoe stopped speaking.\n\nThe dirt/mulch at Wolfwitz's house had the DNA of almost 20 different people, including Zoe, and the DNA from the condom (from Lady Heather) matched DNA on the UNLV book. His car, however, had the fingerprints of a Leon Sneller: Wolfwitz's twin. The boys had been adopted by a Jewish couple and Jacob had inherited the house. Leon, on the other hand, had rejected this and become a Nazi. The CSI's find a WWII era laboratory under the house, where Sneller performed his Mengele-esque experiments (including a siamese twins experiment, currently going on in one room, though neither twin lived after the CSIs rescued them). Zoe had been selected for her eyes: one was blue, the other brown.\n\nThe CSIs are unable to find Sneller until Grissom notices Lady heather's necklace under a couch. He drives out to where Zoe's body was found, and comes across Lady Heather and Sneller. She tied him to the front of his car and whipped him over and over again. Grissom stops her and Lady Heather breaks down sobbing.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nAnother low end episode from Sara, she all but vanishes at the half-way mark.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nIn perhaps a reference to the situation in \"Committed\", Sara doesn't go and see Capt. Jack without someone else from the CSIs with her.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: Where are you at now?  \nSidle: On a train to Crazyville.",

At the scene of the crime, Catherine runs into one of her father's old friends Earnest Boozell (played by Elliot Gould), and she has to forcibly remove him from the scene. He harasses Catherine about running casinos through much of the episode. At the autopsy, Ray and Doc Robbins find an injection site on the dead woman's back, and that she was dead before the shark attacked her body. The tox screen comes back and indicates she was injected with heroin, and it was a first time use.\n\nWhen they determine the shark doesn't come from Boozell's tank, the prime suspect for the shark is the hotel down the block, Macklin's hotel, that also has a shark pool. Meanwhile, Anya Sanchez's prints are found on a hypodermic needle found in the pool. She confesses, and is stunned to find out her felony robbery has become a murder. At the shark autopsy, they determine the shark is Macklin's, due to the tag on it. Macklin admits that it was his, but the shark was an over-eater, and his 'shark guy' took care of it. The shark-guy happens to be the same vet that Boozell uses, Dr. Holloway.\n\nConveniently, Holloway is found dead in the shark tank at Boozell's, his oxygen tank tampered with and filled with car exhaust. The chemical ratios found in the tank matches those spewed from Boozell's car. The surveillance cameras show that a valet parker at Macklin's restaurant, Carne, used the exhaust from Boozell's car, while the two were making peace.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWhen Boozell pesters Catherine, Sara steps in to support Catherine and their work as CSIs.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara's hand is still bandaged from her fight recently. \n\n Quotes\n\nDr. Holloway Now they're [the sharks] in Show Business  \nSidle: Well that's one way to make a living.\n\n* *:\n\nStokes: [He's] awfully fired up about taking a picture with fish.  \nSidle: Well, you know, fish are beautiful.  \n:(Nick and Sara see the fish tank, and inside is the aquavet, floating dead in his scuba gear)  \nStokes: Not when you're sleeping with them.  \nSidle: It's Dr. Halloway.

The nephew is a recovering drug addict, and finds a miniature of the crime scene on his stoop the next day and brings it into Headquarters, which clears both him and the neighbor, the drug trafficker, who had been buying drugs from Penny.\n\nThe miniature scene is as exact as the first one, with the same photograph of a doll with a bloody forehead. They find evidence that Penny had been intended to die in her chair, but the overdose of nicotine she'd been poisoned with caused a seizure, and the miniature's creator had taken the miniature back to correct it. The CSIs manage to capture some blurry video of the miniature being delivered, giving the them their first look at the killer.\n\nGreg is called to court, in an inquest from his accidental killing of a young man. After the CSIs demonstrate the situation to the jury, via Greg's perspective, the inquest finds the death excusable, but not justifiable. Greg is unconvinced, and the family serves him with papers for a civil case.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nCatherine is sent to assist Sara on this case.

They initially assume that whomever stole the car also killed Diane, however it was really the bridesmaids, acting in cahoots, who accidently killed Diane and covered it up. By the time Internal Affairs arrives to take their statements, the case has been solved, and the criminals confessed.\n\nMuch of the episode is told via flashbacks, and everyone's version of the event has a different feel. Sara's seems to be anti-wedding, while Nick embraces the sappier side of marriage. Grissom and Brass are very cut and dried, but Greg is a nearly over-the-top film noir. The name of the episode is a play on the movie, Rashomon, which revolves around the issue that, due to differeing witness accounts, it can be impossible to discern the truth.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Grissom states that it doesn't matter which one of them Internal Affairs speaks with first, as their stories will all be the same.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nThere is a duality to Sara in this episode -- she goes from pessimistic and negative (voicing her opposition to tradition, her commentary on marriage) to humorous and cheerful (the guy flirting with her, comments to Nick). She doesn't like people who blindly follow traditions -- demonstrating some 'Grissom-esque' recall on the subject of marriage -- but she also says that she's not anti-wedding. While waiting for IAB, she takes a nap in the locker room (face down on the bench), and is enthusiastic when Catherine wakes her to process the car. Despite the situation -- stolen evidence and an IAB investigation -- she doesn't let herself get frustrated.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara (and Greg) maxed out on overtime.  \nSara is not anti-wedding, but anti-stupid. She dislikes people following traditions merely for the sake of tradition.  \nSara actually knows about the history of weddings, including the fact that bridesmaids dressed like the bride to confuse evil spirits.  \nAs has been noted before, Sara doesn't mind when guys flirt with her, even if it is a drunken guy at the reception; she takes it all in stride and may appreciate the attention.  \nSara is familiar with author Raymond Chandler's work.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: (holding up lingerie against herself for size) Just in time.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nIt's a relatively slow night for the CSIs, until a plane crashes at Tresser Park, a mile away from the Strip. NTSB Investigator Doug Wilson is brought in to help work the case. The plane took off from Las Vegas airport, headed to Chicago, but cited an unspecified emergency. Then there was radio silence, and the plane just missed running into a tower at the Mediterranean Hotel before crashing.\n\nThe pilot, Keith Mannheim, didn't submit a passenger manifest (not required for a plan his size), so the three additional bodies found in the crash are unknown. The pilots business partner (Dalton Burke, also his life partner of 15 years), is distraught, and had no idea there was anyone else on the plane. One of the bodies on the plane belonged to Charles Harrigan, who had a vendetta against the Mediterranean, which makes the CSIs suspect a revenge attack.\n\nA gun found on the plane initially hints that there was a shooting and encourages the initial theory, but when the flight recorder is found, they determine there was catastrophic pressure loss in the cabin. Investigations on the door shows the seal was tampered with from the outside by someone intimately familiar with planes. Now the hijacking looks like a murder, and since the pilot was the only person expected to be on the plane, either he or the plane itself is the likely target.\n\nTool marks and paint transfers on the cabin door match the tools used by Hal, the regular mechanic for the company. The charter owed him around $6000, however. Hal was out of town, and could not have tampered with the plane, so someone took his tools.\n\nMeanwhile, the gun's owner is identified as Jeffery Forsythe, alive, and explains he loaned the gun to a colleague, Grant Abbot, a criminal lawyer who specializes in cases with violent offenders. Said colleague was headed home to Chicago for some time off, following threats to his life. The Jane Doe on the plane is also identified as Jordan Lowell, a woman with a potential paternity DNA test. Of course, things get even more confused when the pilot is found floating in a pool, leaving the CSI's wondering just who they found in the cockpit of the plane.\n\nThe body is identified as a stripper named Thor, who claimed he was moving in with his boyfriend Keith, the pilot. This is news to Dalton, who protests his innocence, having lost everything in that crash, including the man he loved. Video of the sabotage is blocked by a fuel truck, but they're able to make out the coveralls, which belong to Hal, the mechanic. DNA from the coveralls exonerate Hal and Dalton.\n\nJordan's DNA test cannot be recovered, but the fact that she only has two swabs leads the CSIs to determine she was looking for her own father. Jordan's father was dead, but she had a half-sister, Helen, who is in semi-comatose state, where she is no longer aware of her surroundings, following a car accident over 40 years ago. The home, Tranquil Hours, received millions of dollars from Jordan and Helen's father. Surprisingly, DNA shows Helen and Jordan aren't sisters, but DB suspects that the real surprise is that someone is posing as Helen.\n\nBack at Tranquil Hours, Helen has been moved to critical care, her room cleaned with bleach, and her doctor, Dr. O'Keefe, has called in sick. They find a fingerprint, naming fake-Helen as Marsha Forsythe, and the DNA comes back and connects the fake Helen with whomever sabotaged the plane; Jeffery Forsythe, the lawyer who loaned his gun to his coworker who was on the plane. Forsythe was also a pilot.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWhile Sara is public about having worked with Doug before, she does not disclose to her coworkers exactly how close they once were. Doug is tangentially aware Sara married her boss (and manages to make that a teasing dig at her), while Sara is seemingly unaware Doug split with his wife (also making that a dig at him). While they work together, their old camaraderie appears.\n\nOnly when Grissom calls, and Sara lets it go to voicemail in front of Finn, does some of the truth come out. Sara is feeling a bit of a strain with the long distance relationship, and having her ex, Doug, in town is weird. Finn asks if it will remain weird, to which Sara says it has to.\n\nWhen Doug asks Sara and Grissom out to dinner, and then just Sara, she asks him to not do 'this.' He backs off, but tells her she deserves to be happy.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara worked with Doug Wilson on an NTSB investigation when she was at the San Francisco crime lab.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: to phone Hey, Gil.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nTwo cases are well tied together in this episode, aptly showing how, in the end, we all end up in the same place. The episode is filmed with a lot of split screen, allowing one case to mirror the other and to hi-light the class differences between the dead men. It's interesting to note that the CSI's seem to treat each case as equally important.\n\nOne case is of Julian Harper, and up and coming actor who was found dead in his hotel room by his best friend, Blinky. Through the night preceding his death, Julian's manager (and ex-wife) found a teenaged girl for Julian to have sex with (and the manager paid the girl off to claim Julian was a gentleman), Julian had his room broken into (the thief spent two hours listening to Julian and the girl), he left another girl to Blinky for sloppy seconds, and finally died of auto-erotic asphyxiation. Blinky found him and cut him down, trying to afford Julian a little dignity in death to pay him back for being a great friend.\n\nThe other case is a complicated and convolution relationship of three men from Laos who all work together, hate each other and two are dead. Noy Vipraxy is found dead of a car accident. Later that same night, Samay Thao and his taxi driver are found shot by a shotgun, wielded by Noy's brother, Keo. Samay also has trace from Noy's car on his person (a bit of a broken CD in his eye). Keo insists he shot a burglar, but as the CSI's determine, he was possibly waiting to kill his own brother. With a red herring of the slightly unscrupulous laundry boss, who gently alters Keo's interview to exclude hints that the boss is shady (he's working multiple jobs on the sly, presumably without paying taxes, and is on the insurance plan as a beneficiary for many of his workers), Keo confesses that his brother's dead wasn't a bad thing. Keo brought Noy to America to raise money for the rest of their family. Instead, Noy blew their earnings. So Keo bought a shotgun, and Noy went and got killed in a car. It's possible that either Samay killed Noy as a favor for Keo, and Keo shot Samay to keep the money himself or Keo was waiting for Noy to come home and 'accidently' shoot him, but got Samay instead, when Samay came to tell Keo about what happened to Noy.\n\nIn the end, rich man and poor man are in the morgue together, their lives ending the same way.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara didn't do a whole lot this episode.

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nTwo cases, both surrounded by secrets and lies. Or at least flies.\n\nCatherine runs with the main case, of a woman, Christina Adalian, found dead in front of her baby, Joey, by her sister. While the scene appears to be a suicide, there's no blood spatter on Christina's hand. Another catch is that she's still a virgin and had the baby via Cesarean. Doc Robbins initially suspects frottage, but Sara digs up news that Christina was affiliated with Project Sunflower. Project Sunflower rescued leftover, or 'abandoned', embryos from in-vitro fertilization and match them up with willing parents, working on the belief that life begins at conception. Catherine disagrees with this, and the 'Doctor' of the Project complains about her.\n\nThe gun is a lost cause, as if belonged to a lawyer who gave it to his paralegal, who became an EMT and lost it in a poker game to a guy with a mole between his eyes. The suicide note is analyzed and determined to be written under duress, confirming the evidence. Christina's will mandates that Joey be given to Dan and Kenli Johnson, who just happened to be the bio-parents of Joey. Dan is dead, and Kenli lives with her mother, Mrs. Walkey. GSR is found in their laundry, but it's on a size 12 shirt that belongs to Mrs. Walkey. Under questioning, and after her purse produces a picture of her husband with a mole between his eyes, she confesses. She killed Christina so that Kenli could have 'her' child back.\n\nGrissom, who is late with evaluations again, is pulled off the main case by Conrad Ecklie and the sheriff to help with a case gone to trial. It was the recent murder of the sheriff's god-daughter, and the defense has brought in expert etymologist, Mark Thayer, to prove she died when the suspected killer was out of town. Perhaps more to spike Thayer than help Ecklie, Grissom agrees to work on the case. Thayer presents documentation and a surprise video of an experiment proving his point. Grissom is stymied for a long time, but manages to determine Thayer doctored his pig in the experiment, forcing the flies to grow at a slower rate. Thayer's work is worthless and he is arrested.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nPerhaps unexpectedly, Sara doesn't have a lot of emotional investment in this cast, offering no opinion on in vitro fertilization or conception. She seems content to go with the status quo, even when Catherine flies off the handle a bit, sitting quietly while Catherine vents at the head of Project Sunflower. Sara also displays her research skills, digging up both information on Project Sunflower and the Johnsons. At the initial scene, Sara and Catherine quickly realize that it is not a suicide, but rather a murder. She compliments the tech in QD (Questionable Documents), an older, bearded man. Sara informs Catherine of the biological parents and the victim's will, and together they visit the biological mother and her mother. Sara later finds blood on the biological grandmother's blouse.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara does not express her opinions on abortion or in-vitro fertilization, and doesn't comment on Catherine's zealous questioning of the clinic manager.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Ducks.

Grissom investigates the shooting death of a young woman when her bloodied and bug-infested body is found on a nearby mountain. Most of the circumstantial evidence points to the woman's abusive husband as the likely killer. But Grissom's not so sure, since his analysis of the bugs indicates that the victim was killed three days prior--when the hubby was out of town. Elsewhere, a man claims that a thief stole a valuable painting from his house, and a missing woman is feared dead when blood is found in her abandoned car.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nA woman's body is found dumped on a hillside, swarming with bugs. 'I hate bees' is Sara's reaction, then shows herself to be a little squeamish when dealing with a bug-infested corpse. Sara carries beef jerky, which Grissom 'borrows' to feed the beetles he recovers from the corpse. In the break room, Sara is joking around with Nick.\n\nSara and Grissom examine the corpse in the morgue, and realize that she's a battered wife with multiple old injuries. Grissom teaches Sara about insect chronology. Sara, Grissom and Brass interview the husband -- Sara is a little antagonistic. At the suspect's house, Sara comments on the lack of photos of the wife. She discovers bleach and blood in the back hall, and when she confronts the husband she goes just a bit too far, yelling at him and shoving him until he becomes aggressive towards her. As Grissom pulls her away, Sara points out how the husband treaded her (Sara), given that she has a gun.\n\nSara matches fibers found in the hall to the blanket the victim was wrapped in, which also matches fibers Grissom found on the couch in the victim's residence. Sara tells Grissom she sent the bullet (the husband owns a gun) to Trace, and he informs her that the bugs tell him the victim was only dead for 3 days, not 5 -- so the husband couldn't have killed his wife, which doesn't please Sara at all.\n\nLater on, Sara is asleep in the break room -- Grissom asks her to investigate Warrick. Sara talks to Grissom about hearing the victim's screams in her head all the time. When Grissom says she has empathy, that's all, she asks him if he wants to sleep with her so he can see her wake up in a cold sweat, hearing the victim's screams, and say it's just empathy.\n\nThis prompts Grissom to re-investigate the bugs, and Sara keeps Grissom company while he checks the decomposition rate (and bug arrival rate) with a dead pig, bringing him coffee and a blanket, which she wraps around his shoulders. Sara confronts Grissom about moving on from the case -- then discovers that he's called for a second autopsy of Kaye Shelton. Blue powder around the gunshot wound, which Sara matches with the husband's ammo. Sara says goodbye to the victim in the morgue, then tells Grissom she tracked Warrick to a casino.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is a little squeamish around decomposing bodies, or possibly just insect-infested bodies.  \nSara carries around beef jerky to snack on.  \nSara doesn't like husbands who abuse their wives.  \nSara feels empathy for victims, especially battered wives.  \nSara pays close attention to Grissom, remembering almost everything he's said; she also feels companionable towards him.  \nSara is unafraid to confront a supervisor when she thinks he's wrong, but she's not much on apologies.  \nThis is the case that turns Sara vegetarian. \n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: I hate bees.  \nGrissom: Just paper wasps.

In the car, at the store.  \nGrissom: You have empathy for her Sara. You want someone to pay for what was done to her, that's normal.  \nSidle: (nods long pause) You wanna sleep with me?  \nGrissom: (confused pause, removes glasses) Did you just say what I think you said?  \nSidle: That way, when I wake up in a cold sweat under the blanket, hearing Kaye's screams, you can tell me it's nothing. It's just empathy.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I checked out Warrick. His story about missing court was, uh &#8230; lame. I got this surveillance tape from the Monaco. He was in the casino.

His leg had also been ripped apart by a bear trap. Carl was fond of camping around the mines near where the Doomsday Preppers lived.\n\nThe CSIs find a hidden bunker out by the mines with the help of Nick's dog, Sam, where traces of Carl's blood laces the stairs. A Prepper, Tommy, is found when they investigate, and while his room in the bunker is utilitarian, he has a second bedroom for a girl, or a women. The CSIs find a girl, Miranda, hiding in the air vents. Trace evidence on the dresses lead them to an unsolved murder of Rebecca Barnes, 11 years ago, in Carson City.

After dumping they body of Ty Bently in someone's yard, a dozen of unwashed cult members retreat to their compound and eleven of the twelve die by ritual suicide (spiked vodka) to ascend via the mother ship during the [http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html Orionid meteor shower].\n\nThe cult members broke into the house by slashing the screen door, and proceeded to raid the fridge for junk food. They dumped Ty in the hard, who had numerous broken bones, and killed the dog with the same Ketamine they took later during the peak of the meteor shower. The cult was run by Joseph Diamond, who made a habit of luring impressionable young college students to his side, using sex with the woman (and possibly the men). The FBI had been keeping mild tabs on him for years, but generally he'd drug the kids and steal their money (which they'd written home for) and they'd wake up broke with a hangover.\n\nThis time, the base was at an abandoned military observation bunker in the desert. Ty's ex, Emma, was a cult member, and he had recently argued with Diamond about Emma. Diamond was planning a one person, one way trip to Australia, presumably to take the act someplace new. One of the cult members, Abigail Spencer, catches on to Diamonds cut and run plan. Even though he invites her along, she sees it as a test and kills him.\n\nAbigail then uses her knowledge from her former job to steal enough Ketamine to spike everyone's vodka and kill them. When Ty shows up to get Emma back (and call the cops on the mess), it's Abigail who shoves him the 80 feet down the bunker to his death, and convinces the cult to dump the body where he'll be found. Then she spikes the drinks and watches everyone die. Even though she wanted to join the others in rapture, she seems to realize that there is no Mother Ship, and runs away home without drinking.\n\nWhen the cops come, however, Abigail gets scared and runs off, taking the leftover Ketamine in a last ditch attempt to kill herself. She's saved by Brass and LVPD, and confesses all to Grissom. After Abigail asks if Grissom believes in life 'out there,' he tells her that if there is, they're smart enough to stay away from humans.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nYet another low-key Sara episode; she plays assist and little more.

Catherine is called in by a pornographic-film developer to view graphic footage from a snuff movie in which a woman is brutally slain. But the clues are scant: The murderer isn't clearly seen, the cheap-looking hotel room could be almost anywhere and the film was sent to the developer anonymously. Outside of town, Grissom investigates another killing when a body, smothered with fire ants, is found stuffed inside a large toolbox. The initial findings indicate that the person died well over a year earlier.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Catherine investigate the snuff film. Sara checks the film for prints, can't find any, and Catherine tells her about 'short ends'; Catherine also tells her the facts about snuff films. Sara, Catherine and Warrick check out the hotel where the killing occured, and discover the (freshly painted) room where the killing took place. When she's going over the film with Warrick to try and determine who the killer is, Sara repeats what Catherine told her about short ends as if she had known it all along. Sara and Catherine find the end of the film in the trash, and Catherine tells her about the porno quarantine list; later they find the victim's name on that list. Warrick gets frustrated with the case and throws a phone book out into the hall, barely missing Sara -- he apologizes to her, and she lets him know that they got a warrant based on his findings... then suggests that he apologize to the phone book. At the end, Sara gets a little vindictive when she and Catherine confront the suspect.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara repeats facts told to her by other people (in this case, Catherine as if she had known them all along.  \nSara offers support to Warrick, letting him know that his findings helped the case.  \nThis is the first of several instances where Sara gets a bit vindictive when confronting a suspect.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Biology determining pathology.  \nBrown: Yeah.

Also, a shoot-out at a coffee shop, which may have been a professional hit, leaves five people dead, including a local high roller.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nA dead kid is in the street, apparently run over by a car, but Sara notes that the differences in tread marks shows that the victim was hit twice. At the post-mortem, it's noted that the victim is deaf, which leads Sara and Warrick to a local deaf school, where they manage to upset the school president by bringing in an interpreter (when one isn't needed) and then talking to the interpreter rather than directly to the president\n\nThey report back to Grissom, who gets them back in, and reminds them that this isn't a case of 'us vs. them' (hearing vs. deaf). Despite what he told Sara earlier, Grissom gets personal with the case. During the interrogation of a suspect, both Sara and Warrick realize that they know very little about Grissom. When Warrick finds lice on the victim's shirt (while Sara's checking out the tread marks in a database), she moves back and tucks her hair behind her ears protectively. At one point, when Greg interrupts to grab Grissom, he waves at Sara and she smiles back at him -- no problems with her colleagues there.\n\nWhen Grissom mentions that the busted tail light can't be traced because the serial number is incomplete, Sara tells him that she matched it by comparing it to the tread pattern -- later when they're checking out the suspect's car, Sara and Warrick find the final piece of evidence stuck to the muffler.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is just like anyone else, making generalized assumptions about someone different (in this case, the deaf school president before she finds out differently -- at which point she drops her assumptions.  \nSara still flirting with her colleagues, or at least allowing them to flirt with her.  \nSara' feelings about Grissom are known by her coworkers (or at least by Warrick.  \nSara drives yet again.  \nSara's mechanical talents show again as she goes over the car with Warrick.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: You can tell he's deaf just by his fingerprints?  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I don't like her.  \nBrown: You just don't like other women in Grissom's life.  \nSidle: I'm going to ignore that.  \n\n- -\n\nBrown: Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?  \nSidle: He goes out?  \nBrown: Exactly.

When she is later found dead in her occult shop, it is up to the CSI team to determine her true cause of death. Greg, who reveals to Grissom that an expertise in the 'occult' runs in his family, suspects greater forces may be responsible for the woman's demise.\n\nMeanwhile, a retired cop who used the psychic for help on a 15 year old case of Claire Wallace, believes the suspect in his cold case is the killer. Brass and Grissom agree to reopen the case, and discover the psychic used extortion with other people. Following the psychic's advice, they uncover the body of the long dead wife from the cold case, and subsequently determine that Claire's husband, Gordon, did in deed kill Sedona, believing that she had psychically uncovered that he had killed his wife.\n\nGrissom, who has steadfastly maintained that science will always crack the case in the end, shows Greg Sedona's 'death' book, in which she has written generic phrases to use when speaking of the dead.

Once he escapes into the stairwell, the CSIs are forced to do a room to room search. Going by the name X-Man, the man killed Mr. Kiel, who had brought his son to see Kanye. During the search, they find a woman who had a one night stand with him.\n\nThe finally find a man who matches the killer named Jordan, hiding in the closet of a room he rented with a friend. He adamantly claims he's not the killer. The video time stamps of the night prove that Jordan was in two places at once: having a drink with the one-night-stand, and going out with his friend to a baseball game.\n\nJordan Brentson's DNA matches, but his fingerprints do not. He has no twin, and after following the video trail, they find Xavier Marks, a doppelgÃ¤nger to Jordan. The only thing the two men have in common is they both won free trips to Las Vegas, with mild criminal records. Even their birthdays and places are different.\n\nWhen the lab performs antibody profiling, to determine which 'twin' pulled the trigger, they find the DNA matches both men, but the antibodies match neither. There's a third man! The most likely solution is the triplets were from the same zygote, frozen in vitro, fertilized, and implanted in different mothers. Jordan's mother had used Dr. Keil's services to have one son, and she had asked for the other embryos to be destroyed. They were not.\n\nBrass thinks the mother, Mrs. Brentson, orchestrated the murder as payback for Kiel not destroying the embryos. Kevin Chance, the third brother, also won a free trip to Vegas, but died of an overdose before he could be arrested. Kevin left a suicide video, claiming he killed Kiel as payback for playing god and creating him. The only problem is the evidence implies Kevin was murdered by his brothers. All three of his brothers. Oh yes, there's a fourth brother.\n\nWeirder still, the brothers all won their trips from Dr. Kiel. He'd been keeping tabs on the triplets. Sara talks to Kiel's son, who says his father met with two of the brothers. While she's out with Avery, they determine who the fourth brother is. Avery is the fourth brother, and arranged for his father's murder and brother's faux suicide.\n\nAvery didn't kill his father over money, but becuase he found the truth about his birth. While he managed to create a perfect crime, the evidence only damns him and the deceased Kevin. His other brothers will get off Scott free.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara and Brass talk to the dead man's son, Avery, with Sara promising to come check on him later. She comes back later to explain that Avery will have to go live with family in Wisconson. When he reacts badly, Sara takes him out for ice cream, clearly sympathizing.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara sympathizes with Avery when he seems fearful of going into foster care.  \nInstead of allowing herself to be played, like she was with Hannah, Sara is able to keep perspective.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Are you into twins?  \nMarks Isn't everybody?  \n\n* *\n\nSidle: It must be hard, wanting a child so much.

Marla asked Dennis to steal the house for her so her family would stop fighting after their mother, Lois, died in the house (termite riddled beams dropped a flowerpot on her head).\n\nMeanwhile, the dead body was run of Fred Blanchard, ex-boyfriend of the deceased Hicks mother, and he was stabbed and killed in the stolen house. When the house was driven to the hills, Fred slid out the door and was run over multiple times. The knife was left in his chest and fell out while on the road.\n\nWhen the house is searched for Fred's murder weapon, a skeleton is found in the walls with papers.

Other parents at the park report they saw a boy looking like Jesse being watched by a white male with a 51's baseball cap, as does a necropheliac who saw the boy in the restroom.\n\nWhen Jesse is found in the company of the man and his wife, his DNA matches theirs and he refers to them as his parents. Jesse is actually Adam Esposito. Karen had taken photos from the Esposito family website and photoshopped Adam into pictures with her, essentially stalking the family. However, DNA taken from Karen's house shows that there is a Jesse, and he is missing. Karen herself is more than a little crazy, claiming that Catherine saw Jesse at Karen's house.\n\nThe CSIs determine no one has actually seen Jesse in four years, not since the funeral of Karen's husband, Dwight. Now working a 4 year-old cold case, the CSIs assume the worst: that Jesse is dead. Investigating Karen's house, they find heavy duty anti-psychotics with a four year-old prescription. Opposing Karen's claim that Jesse was home schooled, Grissom determines it was Karen who did the finger-painting and other messes caused by 'Jesse.'\n\nThe CSIs find traces of a body, but not the body itself, in the backyard, and conclude that Karen must have moved the body. Based on testimony from her neighbor, they suspect that the neighbor's dog smelled the body and tried to dig it up, for which Karen killed it (or so claimed the dog's owner). Then she moved Jesse's body to protect it. On the basis of the drugs found in the soil where Jesse had been buried, they infer that Karen gave Jesse her drugs after the funeral, killing him.\n\nRegardless of this, Karen is undeniably insane.

Grissom, Catherine, Sara and Nick investigate when the body of a leggy brunette is discovered floating in the mansion's pool. Their suspicions soon focus on the brash couple, Patrick and Amanda Haynes, who hosted the party and are house-sitting for the absent owner. They claim the former entertainer, now a wealthy older woman, is vacationing in Europe and can't be reached, but the CSI team isn't so sure. Also, Warrick combs for clues when a man is gunned down, possibly by a hit man, in a glass hotel elevator.\n\n Sara Sidle Review## \n\nSara gets woken up on her day off (her first in three weeks) and gets called in. Sara's just a bit cranky and tired, evidencing this with a large yawn. Sara and Nick give instructions to Greg (she 'hates' him because he's awake).\n\nSara perks up at Nick's offer of a steak and egg breakfast, but then Greg comes in and informs them that the DNA they submitted matches a cold case from Texas. Sara discovers that the suspect's Social Security number is actually that of a dead infant -- and then glares at Nick when he asks her if she's sure.\n\nSara, Nick and Catherine are discussing the case (and dating in general), Nick explains the pinholed check to Sara.\n\nSara, Nick, Catherine and Brass have lunch in a restaurant as they discuss the case. Sara and Nick 'go Dutch' on their part of the check (referencing their earlier conversation about dating).\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is not a happy camper when she's woken on her day off.  \nSara has a 'chickenscratch' signature.  \nSara eating fish despite having gone vegetarian in the earlier episode -- however, it's not mentioned that Grissom's pig experiment was what made her go vegetarian until the episode \"Face Lift\". Some vegetarians do eat fish.  \nAdditional note: in a later interview, Jorja Fox was told that the Chilean sea bass is a rare species; she said that she wished she had known that for this episode.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: Someone's bitter.  \nSidle: (growls) I'm tired.  \nStokes: You?

Nash is dead in his dressing room on opening night with alcohol and oxycodine in his system, and evidence of sexual activity scratched into his back. Nash's death looks to be natural (an accidental overdose) until Doc Robbins determines he drowned in his own dressing room, 12 feet from a toilet.\n\nFingernail polish matching that of Knuckles' wife, Terpsie Pratt, is found in Nash's back. She claims to never have slept with him, even though Nash has been hitting on her for years, until he caught her fooling around with a stage manager. Terpsie gave Nash the old college try, but he couldn't keep it up, and was alive when she left. Bingo, as it happens, has a prescription for oxy.\n\nThe CSIs trace the water in Nash's lungs to the ice machine, and the red hair to Knuckles' toupee. Knuckles admits to killing Nash, because he could no longer keep at the routine. He was no longer funny.\n\nKurtis Torse's body with over a hundred bullet holes in his body is found, with head, feet and hands severed (and missing) from the bullets, dumped in an alley, with a gun, and a fingertip shoved into his body. Torse happens to be on the FBI top ten most wanted list, after blowing up an abortion clinic in Seattle, and has been on the run for years, leaving behind a wife and two children. The bullets in his body are traced back to an indoor firing range that only permits the bullets to be used on-site, but there's no evidence in the range of blood.\n\nTrace points the body to a magnasite river wash in Koral, Nevada, downstream from the biggest magnasite mine in the US. The CSIs arrive to find an immense open air shootout, complete with the same bullets found in Torse's body. After an all night search of the property, they finally find body parts, leading them back to the fence behind a van that the shootout participants used for target practice. An accidental murder.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works with Catherine and Ray on the body found in the alley. She finds the fingertip that IDs Torse and goes with Ray to the firing range. Later, at the shootout site, Sara finds Torse's foot and finger.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara had no idea there was a huge indoor firing range phenomenon in Las Vegas.  \nSara only goes to PD firing ranges.\n\n Quotes## \n\n",

He doesn't make out alive, however, as a security guard shoots at him causing him to crash on Fremont street. The shots don't kill him, or even hit him, but the thief collapses anyway, dead. When the CSIs arrive, they learn the money and chips are fake, and the thief's face is grotesquely swollen.\n\nClint, a stunt rider for the Four Kings, died of an allergic reaction, however it was caused by an injection that punctured him through his motorcycle leathers. Back at the casino, none of the witnesses are sure what happened, being confused from the power outage and flash-bang grenades. The CSIs suspect Robert Gentry, the loser in the poker game, who bumped into Clint during the heist, and subsequently vanished before the cops arrived. While looking for Genty, they question Ryan Archer as to how the lights were turned off, and he reveals there's an app for that, but the user would need a code.\n\nGentry is found at another casino, betting with the chips stolen from the Four Kings. He cops to stealing the chips, but claims innocence to the major theft and murder. Also he claims to have seen Clint running the opposite way from where he was killed. This gives the CSIs a lead, and they realize Clint was part of a pair, and played the decoy. Someone else has the money, and probably is the same person who poisoned Clint with snake venom.\n\nJulian Reese, a valet parker for the Four Kings, happens to have a license for the venomous Russell snake. Of course, Julian skipped work, but he's quickly found ... shot in the head in his car, with his snake in the back seat. A set of motorcycle leathers, and the syringe used to kill Clint, are found in the trunk of Julian's car, and trace of mechanic's soap on his shirt. The same soap used by the Ryan Archer. And it was Chad's code that turned the lights off.\n\nWhen he's hauled in, Ryan looses it, shouting that he can't be there, but he won't tell them why. At his house, the CSIs learn his wife died recently of cancer, but also that his 10 month old son was kidnapped by the people behind the heist. Ryan divulges that Julian approached him about a plan, but Ryan declined, only to have his son kidnapped.\n\nEvidence at Ryan's house points the CSIs back to Paul Branston, the guard, who had served four turns in Afghanistan and been discharged with for bad conduct after trying to smuggle out artifacts. Paul also wasn't due to work that day in that room, he traded for the shift. Evidence also shows that Paul kidnapped Ryan's son.\n\nAs the CSI's interrogate Paul's wife, Ryan manages to ditch his cop bodyguard and makes a break to the employee parking lot, where the kidnappers ask to meet him. The CSIs are close behind, but too late. Ryan, scared out of his mind, accidentally shoots the dealer from the poker game. Audrey was also in on the crime, and had Ryan's son in her car. It was also her gun used to kill Julian in his car the day before.\n\nTrace on the baby's clothes comes back positive for Rifampin, a drug used to treat meningitis, and also one that Ryan was taking. Ryan was the mastermind, killing the other four in order to get the money to take care of his son. \n\nSara Sidle Review\n\nSara arrives on the scene with Nick and David Phillips, just as surprised as they are to learn about the fake loot and the thief's condition.\n\nShe and Morgan Brody go to the maintenance room to meet with Ryan, and learn about the app for the lights, as well as the soap Ryan uses. This is beneficial later when David Hodges and Henry both try to one-up each other, explaining the trace found on Julian's shirt. It's Sara who puts it together as mechanic's soap, and she and Jim Brass interrogate Ryan.\n\nLater, Sara and Finn go over Paul's history, learning about his less than honorable service, when Hodges brings them news about the baby-trace in Paul's car.\n\n Character Notes\n\nSara's sympathy is overridden by her hatred of social injustice. Murder is never okay.\n\nQuotes\n\nArcher I didn't do it for me.  \nSidle: Oh let me guess. This is the part where you argue for father of the year?\n\n",

Inside the house is a quadruple homicide that has, literally, painted the Chambliss house red. Due to the water recycling system (grey water is reused to water the lawn), the blood that went down the drain came out the sprinklers. The youngest child in the house, a small girl, Fiona, was cleaned up in fresh clothes after she was killed. Finally, a young man, John Lee, stained in blood, is found holding the girl's bloody nightgown, crying that he loved her. John Lee's house is that of a man-child. He seemed to have never grown up, and for some reason, stalked the youngest girl. When pressured, John confesses to have killing the Chambliss family.\n\nShortly after they announce they have the killer, a woman comes to the station complaining that she is the killer. Leslie Gitig claims she was having an affair with the father, Calvin, and she killed them all. Traffic cameras, phone records and gas receipts all back up her story. In addition, she knows information not released to the press. When the evidence tells the CSIs that John Lee didn't kill the family, they look back at Leslie Gitig, who tells a solid story, but it seems too rehearsed. John Lee recognizes her, and her car, however, allowing for some credibility. Still, it's far more likely she used her law enforcement contacts from her job (legal secretary) to gather inside information.\n\nThe Chambliss family was also selling drugs, and prints on the money lead them to Lonny Gallows, a drug addict. However it's Lonny's boss, and father, who confesses to the crime, after blood stained boots and gloves are found in Lonny's truck. Maurice Gallows claims he tried to protect his son by killing the family who hooked Lonny back on drugs after Maurice put him through rehab.\n\nAll three confessors, however, use the same verbiage: I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family. The three, Lee, Gitig and Gallows, met up at a auto shop after Gitig hit Gallows' truck. Lee worked at the auto-shop. The three conspired to create reasonable doubt as to who actually killed the Chambliss family. It was Leslie Gitig's plan, and John Lee, upset over his part, shot Leslie Gitig and then confessed the true story and killed himself. Maurice Gallows shot Cal, while Leslie Gitig killed the rest.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara comes to help process John Lee's house. When D.B. expresses doubts that John Lee killed the Chambliss', Sara is surprised.\n\nShe works with Morgan and Greg, looking for drugs in the house, teasing Morgan for her driving escapades earlier. Sara finds drugs in the house hidden behind a false electrical panel, behind a unicorn painting.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara still prefers to drive.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: I'll drive.

The entire lab takes the case personally, with even David Hodges complaining that Morgan was undercover (not a role for a CSI). The SUV that kidnapped Morgan is found, sans Morgan, who is actually being held with Ellie in the outskirts of Vegas near an airport. \n\nBoth Larson and Tate blame each other, while still claiming their innocence. When Tate is killed in a car explosion, and the girls are still being held by the killer, it does absolve him (as does DNA). Since Larson is in custody, the CSIs are officially out of suspects until Sara and Greg decrypt the ternary DNA, filled with porn, showing that Tate was a pedophile, and Jake (the driver of the SUV that kidnapped Morgan) and his brother Matthew were two of his victims.\n\nBefore the CSIs find the girls, Morgan and Ellie are able to break free of their shackles, stabbing Matthew, tying him up, and making a run for it. Just outside, Ellie claims she thinks another girl is in the house. When Morgan goes back in, Matthew is missing, as Ellie did not actually tie him up. Realizing there is more danger staying in the house, Morgan runs back out only to face an armed Matthew. She manages to overpower him momentarily, disarming him in the process, and Ellie grabs the gun and shoots Matthew. While Morgan thanks her, Ellie shoots Morgan in the back.\n\nMorgan survives, but claims to the CSIs that Matthew shot Morgan and Ellie killed him in self defense. The evidence does not support this, and further goes to show that Ellie knew Matthew: he was her fiance. They find out too late, however, as Ellie has stabbed her mother to death because Nancy knew that Ellie and Matthew were a couple. She had been helping the boys all along. While Brass talks her out of killing him, he's still brokenhearted over Nancy's death.\n\nIn the present, the CSIs are at the funeral of Jim Brass' ex wife, and Ellie's mother, Nancy.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nInitially Sara is still in San Francisco when Morgan initial goes missing, however she had returned around the time the SUV was discovered. When Ecklie called her in, Sara checked up on and verified Father Larson's claims about Oliver Tate's ties to some of the missing girls.\n\nIn the lab, Sara works on processing and decrypting the dowels found in a boat in a storage room, with a dead girl. When Greg determines the dowels are in ternary, he likens it to the synthetic DNA found in the same scene, as well as in Tate's condo, which can be used to store data. Sara gets a court order for computers from Tate's old biotech company to decrypt the data, where she finds porn.\n\nAfter the girls are rescued, Sara processes the gun and finds inconstancies between Ellie's story and the GSR evidence. It's Sara who makes the connection between Ellie and Matthew, finding photographs proving the two had prior knowledge.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara returns from San Francisco  \nSara believes the evidence more than Ellie, which is abnormal for her (perhaps because she's met Ellie before).\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: We've got a situation here.\n\n",

When Winthrop spots them, he kills his father and Shaw, who jumps between Finn and a bullet.\n\nBrother Larson also talked to Collin Winthrop shortly before he died, contrary to what he claimed when questioned by Finn. Larson was also the father of the brothers. Mae was Collin's daughter and mother of the killers. She was also Sister Alice, the woman at the convent where the boys where born. Alice is on the run, however, and Winthrop attacks Finn, locking her in the trunk of a car with plans to dump her in the desert. D.B. Russell interrupts him, coming to pick up Finn and take her to Seattle to find Alice.\n\nWinthrop is shot when the police burst in and Finn is left in critical condition. Finn remains in a coma as the episode ends while Winthrop will recover and pay for his crimes. Nick takes the job in San Diego.\n\nSara Sidle Review\n\nNick asks Sara if he should take the job in San Diego. \n\nWhile Nick is in San Diego, Sara is left in charge of the lab as DB and Finn are headed to Seattle. She proves herself more than capable, reading the situation and sending out the CSIs to the right places at the right time.\n\n Quotes\n\nStokes: You know, Sara, after all these years, I've finally learned what's important to me, and it's not a promotion.  \nSidle: Well. You know what Grissom would say. You gotta go where you can do the most good.\n\n",

Fifteen years ago, Catherine helped put John Mathers on death row for the rape and murder of a coed at a nearby college. Her body was dumped in a trash bag, and two other girls found the same way were also linked to the suspect. As the episode opens, Mathers is about to be executed when he's granted a stay based on new DNA evidence. But while Catherine awaits the results of tests on hair samples found on the first victim, another girl at the same school is murdered...and discarded just like the first three--meaning the wrong man could be behind bars. Meanwhile, Brass, Sara and Grissom investigate a missing person's report on a teenage girl.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara doesn't have much in this. When a guy is found with a bloody shirt and his teenage daughter is missing, Sara gets to process him. She's fairly blasÃ© at first about the missing girl, figuring that she ran away from her drunken father. Later she discovers that her case is the same as Catherine's case, and that their missing girl is another victim of the WLVU 'Blue Paint' killer. She goes over the campus crime scene with Warrick, Catherine and Grissom, and takes the railing back to the lab.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nOnce again Sara shows her mechanical strengths, going over Debbie Restons' car with Warrick.  \nSara seems to understand ugly family situations.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Great. We're looking for a guy with 20/80 vision who drives a Chevy with a black interior.\n\n",

Very recently, she had been fired from her bank teller job and was accused of stealing $10,000. She had also been to a hypnotist recently, to help her lose weight. They hypnotist had planted a post-hypnotic impression in the mind of the suicide and another bank teller, to have them give her $100s instead of $1s, as change for a $20, robbing the bank. After the suicide caught on, the hypnotist had to have her die.\n\nMeanwhile, Grissom works a case of a woman savagely killed in an alley with her two-year-old nearby. The woman was a gambling addict who often took her 18-year-old son's paychecks to feed her addiction. The missing child was found, having been taken by her loan shark, who she owed $12,000. She was killed by her son, who turned out not to be her son, but her lover and the father of the baby. They had met when they were Guidance Counselor and 15-year-old student, but when she tired of him and lost their baby, he was so angry he killed her.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWith the lab shorthanded, Grissom delays going in to work to lie in bed with Sara, fully clothed, processing recent events. She suggests they go away on a trip, but Grissom feels obligated to keep the lab staffed. After he leaves for a case, Greg calls Sara in to revisit the Adlers . Tom had removed Pamela's breathing tube because he was being harassed by Tony Thorpe, the kid who had raped his wife and put her in a coma. Tom is arrested and charged because assisted euthanasia is a felony offense in Las Vegas. Sara sides with Tom, however the law is clear, and Sara can no longer support order without justice, which is why she can't be a CSI anymore.\n\nGrissom helps Sara to investigate, but there's no evidence to support Tom's accusations. They argue about the Adler's relationship, Grissom suggesting that a relationship in stasis dies, until they get so meta, Sara has to ask if they're discussing the Adlers or their own relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, Greg learns the law has changed. In 2000, when the crime occurred, Pamela would have to die within a year and a day from the crime for Tony to be convicted of murder. Now, so long as her death could be attributed to the rape and assault, Tony would go down for murder. When Tony comes to the station, he's been in a wheelchair since last Christmas, which means Tom lied. Sara confronts Tom, who says that he was angry Tony got away with it, and he couldn't move on with Pamela still alive. Both keeping her alive and killing her were selfish actions, however, and he couldn't win for losing.\n\nSara leaves Vegas shortly thereafter.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara wants to visit the Galapagos Islands, following Darwin's footsteps.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Maybe we should go away for a while.  \nGrissom: Can't.

She's also first on the scene when his car is exploded and then shoved down a hill, on fire. Sara has to drag her away before the car burns up entirely. The CSIs find that there was a bomb in the car, and he was dead before the fire started. When they determine Julia is lying to them about feeling the explosion, Sara and Nick investigate her office and find enough evidence to bring Julia in for questioning. In interrogation, Julia professes her innocence, but offers no explanations. She derails the questioning by revealing that she and Grissom were once intimate, and accuses Sara of allowing that relationship to color the case.\n\nThe bomb used to blow of Dr. Lambert was made with a Shake Alert device found on Gilbert College. The CSIs search all the dorm rooms and finds that Michael, Julia's TA, has a Shake Alert device that is totally different. They talk to him, but he wasn't at the party. He tips the CSIs off to Sean Wyatt, who had a fight with Dr. Lambert, and a favorite of Julia, and they find trace in his room. He is innocent, but he was sleeping with Julia. In fact, his alibi is that he and Julia were together after they left the party.\n\nWhen Sara and Ray go to bring Julia in for further questioning, a bomb explodes in her office. The CSIs are okay, and investigate Michael, the TA, further, as he delivered the package with the bomb. Michael claims its a setup, and continues to blame Sean. When Sara notices him signing something neither she, nor her interpreter, know, she asks Betty, who says it's LSQ -- Quebecois sign language. But Sean is British. Once the CSI's determine that the bomb was set off via an audio clue, they secretly test Sean's ability to hear.

Gil was supposed to come, but got stuck in Peru when 'another' mass grave was found. The phone call cuts out and Sara catches Julia (then unknown to her) coming out of a room where a man remains, looking like she was having sex with him moments before. Sara then finds her mother-in-law, Betty Grissom, who introduces her to Julia Holden, who is 'like a daughter' to Betty. Sara is comfortable with Betty's apparent preference to Julia, and later tells Catherine that she and Betty don't get along well.\n\nAfter the murder, the CSIs are surprised to see Sara there, and more so to see her in a dress. They had never seen her in a dress before (skirts yes , but not a dress). Ray and Nick tease her, but bring her coveralls and boots so she can help.\n\nOnce Julia reveals that she and Grissom were once intimate, Brass wants Sara off the case. The news doesn't seem to bother Sara all that much. Betty comes to talk to Sara about the case, upset that Julia was interrogated. Sara is annoyed at Betty for not telling her about Julia and Grissom's relationship before she interrogated Julia, and Betty lays the blame on the fact that Grissom and Sara don't live in the same city. She doesn't understand how Grissom and Sara can live so far apart.\n\nAfter solving the case, Sara and Betty share a Skype conversation with Grissom, who is in Peru on 'government business.'

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\n17 year-old Stacy was found wrapped in a shower curtain, in her school's flower bed, having last been seen alone at tennis practice. Marlon West, her classmate, is accused of her murder, based on the evidence of Stacy's hair in his shower and sink drains. However, on the stand it is his 12 year-old sister, Hannah, who confesses to the crime.\n\nWhat is known is that there were fake 'out of order' signs in the girls' locker room, and the only non-labeled showerhead was packed with sodium, so that it exploded when Stacy used it. The explosion was big enough to cut Stacy, and she grabbed the shower curtain and ran off. In her panic, she fell down a flight of stairs and cracked her head open. The body was dragged to the flower bed, and Stacy's car was left outside her boyfriend house, Scott Baird.\n\nIn an earlier confessional, Marlon explained that he hated Stacy, though everyone else at the school adored her. Hannah also disliked Stacy, mostly because Stacy harassed Hannah, who threw off the grading curve. Stacy pranked Hannah a couple times, before enlisting Scott to encourage Hannah to come to the Spring Formal and give her a dress from Stacy. At the dance, wearing the dress, the words 'FLAT' and 'Rainbow Party!' were written in ink that only showed up under the black light of the dance. Pictures were taken and Hannah was embarrassed on [http://www.myspace.com MySpace].\n\nThe blood found on Hannah's shirt was her own, but the soil matched the flower garden. Nick and Sara explore the house while Sofia talks to the parents. The parents obviously prefer Hannah, to the point they ignore her brother. The siblings share the bathroom where Stacy's hair was found, and while Marlon's room has no evidence, Hannah's has her award winning science fair project on elemental sodium.\n\nWhile Hannah's prints are on the shower curtain, Scott's bloody prints are found on the car. The bloody prints were left over from Scott and Stacy's first sexual experience; he'd wiped his hands under the seat.\n\nUsing Warrick's wife's niece, he Nick and Sara test the crime and determine it's most likely the siblings committed it together, as Stacy would be too heavy for Hannah to drag. But Hannah claims to have used a cart to move the body, while Marlon sticks to his story. A pizza order to the West house at 9 P.M. (Stacy's time of death), exonerates one of the two, but the delivery boy can't remember which one answered the door.\n\nThe DA goes ahead with prosecuting Marlon, as Nick and Ecklie think he did it, and only Sara thinks it was Hannah. Marlon is found not guilty, and when he's checked out of jail, Hannah and Sara talk. Sara's worried about what will happen to Hannah, and Hannah says that no one cares about Marlon and how she can write a book about all this. Then she marvels at how people can see things that were never there, and confides to Sara: 'I didn't kill Stacy, Marlon did.'\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara, a smart girl and the odd one out at her school, sympathizes with Hannah, and in the end, is played by the child genius.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nWhile Sara is the only one of the team who believes that Hannah is the killer, she still lets the little girl 'play' her.\n\n Quotes\n\nSara: (reading what was written on Hannah's dress) Rainbow party?  \nNick: Yeah, it's a party game where the boys get the girls to wear different colored lip sticks while they have oral sex. The boy with the most colors wins. It's supposed to be trendy.  \nSara: So much for spin the bottle.",

        "content": "\nSynopsis\n\nA well-to-do man is found dead, far from his hotel, in fancy, party clothes. He was on a scripted night of fantasy and entertainment, which included hustling people at pool, being chased in a high speed car race, and getting the beautiful girl. What was not a part of the script is his death.\n\nThe team follows the victim via hotel surveillance, discovering who he was with and where he went; a banged-up Ferarri gives them more clues. As part of his vacation, his boss set him up with a 'fantasy fulfillment' service, one which checks a client's background to reveal their secret desires, then crafts a fantasy based on those desires. Normally the service is used by marketers and advertisers, to create a climate in which people will be more relaxed and more inclined to buy their products or services.\n\nIn the end, the high-roller dies because he can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and gets a fatal beating from the bodyguards of a rich Korean gambler.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara is her usual investigative self in this, trading barbs with Greg as they strip a car, and tracing cell phones via computer. There are, however, unspoken vibes in the air. At the end, when the team is putting together the final clues of the puzzle, the talk turns to fantasies -- several times during this she and Grissom exchange glances, leaving us to wonder what their fantasies might be like.\n\nSpoilers made much of the scene between Grissom, Sara and Caprice (the man running the fantasy fulfillment service), and how his insight would reveal an aspect of Grissom and Sara's 'relationship.' In truth, the scene was tame and while both Grissom and Sara stole looks at each other, nothing overt was brought up. It was obvious Sara still has feelings for Grissom, and it appears Grissom may still harbor affection, but nothing is definitive.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nAs has been noted before, Sara seems most comfortable working with Greg, trading quips and jokes with him.  \nSara obviously has her fantasies, but we will probably never know what they are -- other than the fact that they likely involve Grissom.\n\n Quotes\n\nSara Please tell me there are something more to this guys and cars thing, besides the obvious penis extension metaphors.  \nGreg: So you want me to lie?  \n\n- -\n\nGrissom: Some guys are intimidated by beauty. Or fear rejection. _  \nSidle: (narrows her eyes in reaction to this_",

The room has been the scene of a party, as well as a possible struggle, as Sara notes from the broken lamp on the floor before she dusts for prints. They track down Lynn Henry, who rented the room for a bachelorette party, but the women claim the victim (a male dancer) was alive when they left at 3 am. Sara notices bruises on Lynn's wrists.\n\nAfter determining the victim died long before the women said he did, Sara and Warrick bring them in for questioning; the victim had sex before he died, and Sara asks about the bruises on Lynn's wrists again. Lynn claims she was raped and hit the man over the head with the lamp, so while the other two women are released, Lynn is taken to the hospital for a SART (Sexual Assault / Rape Trauma) exam.\n\nBecuase there was no trace of the lamp debris on the victim, Sara and Warrick return to the hotel room. Warrick finds a tiny diamond (actually, cubic zirconia) on the bed. When the SART exam reveals that Lynn hadn't had sex for a while, the women are brought back in during the wedding itself. Detective Riley leaves the room in embarrassment when Sara explains the vaginal clock to the women, to Sara's amusement.\n\nMeg (the bride-to-be) confesses to having consensual sex with the victim and then changing her mind partway through it, hitting him with the lamp. However Meg's ring is a real diamond, and her fiancee's is zirconia. Indeed, his ring is missing a stone, and the fiancee admits to having killed the victim after discovering him having sex with Meg.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara drives to the scene.  \nSara is amused by Riley's embarrassment during the vaginal clock explanation.\n\n Quotes\n\nGrissom: Sara, Warrick -- dead body in the Lucky Seven Motel.  \nSidle: Is that the place with that weird pool?  \n\n- -\n\nBrown: (reading the call sheet) Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.  \nSidle: Any chance it's old age?  \n\n- -\n\nBrown: Who's the room registered to?  \nSidle: Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion.  \n\n- -\n\nBrown: She lied to us.  \nSidle: At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: This is the vagina, and it does tell a monologue.\n\n",

Sara takes samples and evidence from 'Jane Doe' at the hospital; after collecting everything, she discovers a St. Catherine's medal in the victim's belongings, and sits down to explain to the unconscious victim who St. Catherine was and why she admires her. Sara promises the victim that she'll find who did this; Grissom arrives and tries to dissuade Sara from getting too involved with the victim.\n\nSara, Grissom and Nick go through the evidence collected -- it's apparently a gang shooting; Sara takes the ball cap to DNA.\n\nLater, Sara goes through missing persons reports on the computer, hoping to identify the victim. Grissom asks her if she has any diversions, anything outside of work because she maxes out on overtime every month, sits at home and listens to her police scanner, and reads forensics textbooks; if she doesn't find something to do outside of work, she'll burn out. Sara promises that she's almost finished with the computer, but instead stays all night going through reports until she identifies the victim.\n\nA suspect is brought in, and Sara discovers that Grissom told Nick to keep her out of the interrogation room.\n\nSara and Nick are back in the lab, and Sara begins to sing to herself again (Blondie's 'One Way Or Another') -- when Nick tells her she has a nice singing voice, she denies it.\n\nSara goes to the hospital to tell the unconscious victim that they found the assailant, and meets the victim's husband. Sara is barely able to control her emotions. She talks to Grissom about the victim and loses control, crying. She says that she wishes she was like Grissom, without feelings.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara admires brave women such as St. Catherine.  \nSara gets obsessive with some cases -- in this instance, staying up all night going through computer reports.  \nSara's only activities outside of work are reading forensics textbooks and listening to her police scanner.  \nSara puts in the maximum allowable amount of overtime every month.  \nSara gets quite emotional and involved with certain cases, mainly rape and domestic abuse.  \nSara sings to herself, but claims she doesn't even know she's doing it.  \nSara admires -- in a backhanded manner -- Grissom's lack of feelings.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: I don't like anything [...] and I read crime books and I listen to my scanner.  \n\n- -\n\nStokes: Did anyone ever tell you that you have a nice singing voice?  \nSidle: Yeah, if you like chalk on boards.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: I wish I was like you, Grissom.

Among the dead include two band members (front man and bass player), a white 18-year old Kevin, and a young Latino man named Timo Pedia. The kicker? The band is a white supremacist hate core band: White Rising.\n\nTimo was killed in the storeroom at the club before being dumped in the dance floor.\n\nThe fire was set intentionally, initially thought to be via a cardboard box doused in gasoline with a candle as a timer. Hodges traces the cardboard back to Lee Wong Automotive, which surprises Nick, as Brass recently worked a case where Lee Wong Jr. was beaten into a coma when 'White Rising' played at the club before. Nora Wong explains that she and her friends had made Sky Lanterns for Lee, and the evidence is from months ago.\n\nPart of the reason the fire was so bad was that a car was blocking the door. This car was used by Caleb Voight (borrowed from a minion in his skinhead community) after he killed Timo. While Caleb didn't start the fire, he saw who did, and describes the shirt worn by the John Doe who survived the fire, but is now on life support: Ian Baxton, a serial arsonist for hire.\n\nBaxton had been hired by the club owner, who hasn't able to keep the club afloat.\n\nSara Sidle Review \n\nWhile Nick and Finn work the arson, Morgan and Sara work the deaths. \n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara has a strong aversion to death caused by trampling.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: However the physics worked, this kid went through hell.\n\n",

But hair cutting turns to murder when a previous victim is found dead in her home, with her eyes cut out. She was killed by an overdose of morphine, and then bleached her hair and styled her in retro clothes, shoving a small braid of hair down her throat. A second woman is killed after her makeup is applied, and instead of her eyes being gouged out, she's been blinded.\n\nTheir clothes are vintage '70s, not remakes, and show signs as having been in storage. When combined with some hair found on the scene, the CSIs find Mrs. Kemp, who appears to be the inspiration for the killer. She had lost her hair to chemo, however her wig was made of her own hair, made by a wigmaker who took some of her dresses as ... inspiration.\n\nJeffery Fitzgerald is brought in, his studio searched, and evidence is found: hair samples, wigs and morphine. Before they can find enough for a conviction, a third woman is killed, this one managing to contact D.B. before being killed. Since Jeffery is in custody at the time, and the hairs at the studio don't match the women, he's let go.\n\nHairs at the scene and a photo of a young Mrs. Kemp lead the CSIs to look at her son, Adam, however it's Lucinda Kemp's doctor, whose mother looked much like Mrs. Kemp, who was the killer. His mother also had cancer.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara works the case with D.B., cracking morbid jokes with Morgan while processing the apartment of the dead girl. She is also friendly with Hodges, ribbing him in the lab. Working closely with D.B., she hypothesizes on what the killer's motives may be. Sara also convinces a doctor to break doctor/patient confidentiality and get the CSI's information on the killer's 'inspiration.'\n\nWhen arrested, Jeffery stares at Sara's hair, creeping her out.

Sara seems to enjoy working in close proximity with Grissom under the coaster loading platform, where she finds a greasy substance on the support frame; they requisition the maintenance guy's pipe wrench, and later Sara finds another pipe wrench in the park employee's car. Sara and Nick go through the coaster photos, and discover that the dead employee had sex on the coaster the night before; she and Grissom go and question 'Cleopatra', who confirms it -- Sara nods when Cleo explains that the employee was a hot guy who didn't notice her. Hodges identifies the greasy substance Sara found, and she discovers who had a prescription for that particular ointment, showing off to Grissom with a trivia question about the real Cleopatra. Sara and Brass talk to the suspect, and Sara grabs prints from his broom -- later she and Grissom question the suspect, and she realizes why he killed the park employee.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara thinks of the novel A Turn of the Screw as a mystery rather than a ghost story; the first of several comments over the seasons marking her interest in horror stories.\n\n Quotes\n\nSanders: So, when he asks if anybody has any questions, he's not really asking?  \nSidle: (smiles) Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt.

Back at the lab, Sara and Morgan look into the bomber's possible targets, and come up with three casinos. When the bomber comes too, he's speaking Armenian. Doc Robbins suspects it's because of the head injury, and is a type of amnesia.\n\nThe bomber is recognized on the news by the manager of the motel where he rented a room. However before the CSIs get there, the room is tossed, presumably by his associates. They are able to find his passport, however, naming him Arman Agakian. Alas, while Sara is learning that Agakian likely removed the bomb and did not plant it, Mr. Agakian dies mysteriously, and David Phillips is barred from picking him up by the FBI.\n\nThe USB drive Sara and Morgan Brody found in the hotel room, which is filled with information about the bomb placement, but curiously David Hodges and Henry determine the bomb was never actually meant to go off. This comes to a head when Sara runs into the FBI in D.B. Russell's office. Agakian was an undercover FBI agent, working to infiltrate the Armenian mob. He was planting dud bombs, which the FBI would then find and publicly announce were very well made. Oh, and he wasn't dead at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Greg is served regarding a case from 2006, for which new evidence came to light, exonerating the convicted. However Greg is accused of planting evidence. Finn works with the defense criminalist to clear his name.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWhile Greg is on his way back from his case, Sara calls and asks him to pick up a veggie burger from AJs for herself and Morgan Brody. Sadly, before Greg arrives, she heads off on her case.\n\nWhile holding the bomb, Sara is clearly terrified and shaking, but she holds as still as possible. Once the bomb is wheeled out, her legs give way and she falls into a seat on the nearby gurney. She does not loose her cool, and remembers to tell the bomb tech she'll need the pieces for evidence.\n\nWhen Sara finds out Greg is under review, she comes to talk to him and see how he's doing. While Grissom was Greg's teacher, Sara was very much his mentor. While she has to return to her case, Sara makes the time to drive to Parumph and pick up Greg's favorite pastries to try and cheer him up.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara is still a vegetarian.  \nSara looses her appetite when facing death.  \nWhen Morgan is stumped as to the USB's password, Sara comes up with the solution.  \nSara still hates having to hand over cases. \n\n Quotes\n\nBomb Tech How ya holding up?  \nSidle: Just willed myself not to sneeze. Almost blew us both up.  \nBomb Tech Keep up the sense of humor.  \nSidle: I wasn't kidding.\n\n* *\n\nBrass: How you doing, Sara?  \nSidle: A little shaky. Nothing like staring into the abyss for twenty minutes to decide what's important in life.  \nBrass: It's sad how it takes something so intense to make us stop and smell the coffee, huh?\n\n",

Iona had been shot with a stun gun before being dumped, which causes more trace than normal to cling to her.\n\nAfter breaking up with her boyfriend, Iona quit the shelter. Her datebook last says she was seeing Dr. Heather Kessler (aka Lady Heather). Heather is pleased to see Sara, and discusses Iona's intimacy issues due to her lack of childhood (having to raise her siblings). Via gestalt role-play, Iona acted as a cat, and seemed to be improving until, in her last session, she refused to break out of character at the end of the session and bit her boyfriend. The boyfriend admits that he snooped in Iona's stuff and found she was into bondage.\n\nA fake tooth left by Iona leads them to Dr. Tyrell Neth, who specializes in making feline-teeth. He also runs a rather large cat house for people who, like Iona, like to play at being cats. Iona had moved into his palace and was living in his pine tree. Since other pets at Neth's have stun-gun marks, they were made by her own stun-gun. A latent print leads them to her coworker at the shelter, who tried to bring Iona 'back' to sanity by stunning her and kidnapping her. But, as in her therapy session, Iona refused to break out of her persona, left the car and fled into the woods where she died.\n\nHeather has also been following the news about Haskell and his relationship with Langston. When he goes to talk to Heather about the current case, she brings up Haskell and the reciprocity of the dom/sub relationship -- like that of Haskell and Langston.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick and Dr. Robbins are accidentally called to a fresh suicide of a teenage girl, Maria Diorio. Dr. Robbins, noticing she's pregnant and the fetus is moving, performs an emergency cesarian and saves the baby. The autopsy implies that she'd been in a fight two hours before she died. Maria's mother had no idea she was pregnant, and is stunned to find out about the granddaughter she now has. Her boyfriend, an honor student, knew she was pregnant, but also that she was very much despised by her schoolmates to the point that they made a website mariaisabitch.com. The bullying led her to suicide and they follow up on the kids who created the website.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nAs in the past, Sara takes any issues with women being abused to heart. She brings Iona's datebook back from the shelter and sees appointments with 'Dr. K.' Sara and Heather don't exactly get along, but they do manage to respect each other as professionals.\n\nSara seems uncomfortable with the idea of gestalt roleplaying to work through issues, but keeps her personal views out of the case and remains non-judgemental.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nGrissom is still in Peru (and Heather knows about his work).  \nSara drinks chamomile tea.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: Maybe she escaped one animal, only to fall prey to another.",

The vic was dressed after being struck in the head. The body turns out to be former deputy directory of operations, Vance Colton, who was dying of cancer and writing a tell-all book.

Catherine and Warrick, who worked on Caroline's case, join Sara and Nick on the Sidley case, with the intent to found evidence in their old case. The blood found (which is Caroline's), leads them to investigate the chimney further, and Caroline's body is found. Martin's son, Tad, is also found alive, having skipped school for a few weeks to party. Before Martin learns of this, he tries to pin the body on Tad, who confronts his father. The John Doe body was, in turn, placed in the chimney by Caroline's father, Don, who took it from the hospital where he works, knowing that the CSIs would investigate.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara again shows her type-A personality (wanting to do everything herself) when she practically searches the entire home by herself and with her love of power tools. While she strongly dislikes cases where women (or girls) are killed or abused, she remains calm and collected as she has all season.

Sara is sitting in the locker room, rehearsing her speech to Grissom -- a supervisory review is mandatory after the PEAP visits -- but is interrupted by Greg, who introduces her to the new DNA tech. Sara and Nick investigate the case of an 'alien' buried in the desert near the infamous Area 51. Their search leads them to various quickie marriage chapels in Vegas, where the victim -- dressed as an alien -- was an marriage official, and a feud between two different chapels. Both Sara and Nick seem a little amused -- and a little flustered -- when the preacher at the first chapel assumes they are there to get married.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nSara flashes the Star Trek 'Live Long and Prosper' at the preacher in the quickie chapel.  \nDuring the summer Sara saw a PEAP counselor, as a result of her drunk driving arrest at the end of the 4th season.  \nSara is supposed to have a talk with her supervisor after finishing her PEAP sessions, but doesn't until much later in the season.\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle:: (to a mirror) So I had some time to think while I was away -- enough time to figure out why I made such a stupid mistake.

His blood pressure is dangerously low and Brass flatlines on the table. The doctors bring him back, and Brass hallucinates, remembering when he asked Grissom to be his emergency contact and to have power of attorney in case something happens, because there's no one he trusts more with his life or death. Grissom is informed he may have to make a choice soon about what to do.\n\nBefore that can happen, Grissom is called away for a dead body on the train tracks near Henderson. The body is an apparent decapitaion by the train. Grissom finds a bad toupee, and David (the coroner) opens the body's shirt to find that the waist has been shaped into a perfect hourglass.\n\nCatherine and Warrick find a man dead in his apartment after a long night of partying. There was a cake, drugs and alcohol all over the apartment, but the body is only a few hours dead. Catherine finds a mirror with blood on it.\n\nNick finds the head to the decapitated body in a stream a ways from where the body was found. Doc Robbins explains that the body shape was done intentionally over a long period of time. The cause of death was a very large caliber bullet shot, not decapitation. Hodges says that white cream on the decapitated body was cortizone cream, for an itch, and the fibers indicated the clothes were vintage.\n\nMeanwhile, Brass' condition is still critical. He may need surgery to remove the bullet, but either way it's not good for Brass' long term odds. Grissom weighs the risks and approves the surgery and contacts Ellie, Brass' daughter to come to Vegas.\n\nThe party-boy was filled with drugs and booze to the gills. It if was illegal, he was into it. The mirror's blood matches a hooker who'd been arrested after a trick roll. The hooker's DNA also matches the pubic hairs found all over the dead body.\n\nGreg has taken over watching Brass, and asks Grissom about Brass and Grissom's relationship. Grissom attests to the fact that they don't hang out, but is distracted when Ellie arrives and is her usuall abrasive self.\n\nSara stops by Grissom's office asks if he's okay. Grissom is looking at a magazine about the use of a corset for men. Sara takes the photo of man to a corset shop, who identifies the body as Caleb Carson, a real mans man. Sara and Sofia go to Caleb's house, where he's shown to be an intense Civil War buff. His ancestor, Colonel Caleb C.C. Carson, is prominent in the collection, as are large caliber, old style pistols.\n\nGrissom comes and inspects Caleb's diorama, while Warrick waits with Brass. The surgery was just completed and they removed the bullet, but Brass was still unconscious. Sofia reveals her father was a Civil War buff. Sara prints the corset Carson wore, because it laces in the back and he'd have to have had someone to help him. Corset wearing also ran in the family, as Colonel Carson also wore one.\n\nWarrick and Ellie talk. Brass never talks much about her.\n\nThe hooker from the party-boy, aka Manny Rupert, says that she earned the $10,000 and that Manny had wanted more sex after six go-arounds, and shot at her when she bailed. Catherine points out the hooker isn't a $10-G a night girl. Manny's official cause of death is diabetic shock.\n\nCaleb Carson's driver and dresser is brought in, his prints matching those found on the corset. He is stunned to learn about Caleb's death. Caleb was last seen at a duel at Gettysburg: a reenactment site outside of Las Vegas. Caleb and a Northern soldier got into a tiff at the reenactment (over the Northern soldier using his cell phone during a reenactment). They dueled, but Caleb used real bullets.\n\nGrissom and Sara reenact the duel with cameras. The blood matches the Northerners story, but they also find what may be the location of Caleb's decapitation. The Northerners gun is found to be unable to have killed Caleb, because it was configured to only shoot black smoke.\n\nManny's sister says he was just diagnosed as a pre diabetic. He'd just turned 40 and had acted like it was a death sentence. Warrick is less than sympathetic.\n\nCaleb's blood is that of the second pool by the train. The hair fibers are a toupee, however. The toupee matches his driver/dresser, who confesses that after Caleb shot the Northerner, he and Caleb wrestled for the pistol, accidentally killing Caleb. The driver staged the body on the tracks, to pay homage to how Colonel Carson died, standing on the tracks, shooting at a Yankee train until it ran him over.\n\nNick keeps an eye on Ellie, which may be good, because she calls the payroll asking about Brass' pension. Ellie is brought to Brass's office, where she sits and sees pictures of her as a child. But she says it's easier to love a child than an adult. At the hospital, Catherine stands vigil over Brass. Lindsey, her daughter, calls, upset about Catherine not being home. As Catherine hangs up, Brass has small emergency where he's not getting enough oxygen. After he's helped, he wakes up and reaches for Ellie, who runs off.\n\nWhen Brass finally wakes up completely, he sees all the CSI's outside the room, happy to find him alive.\n\nGrissom, in a bedroom, talks about how he'd like to know before he dies. He'd like the time to say goodbye and do the things he'd never been able to do before. As he talks, Sara comes out of the bathroom, with damp hair, in a bathrobe and says she's not ready to say goodbye yet. Grissom smiles.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara spends most of her time working on the corset angle of the Carson case. When Brass wakes up, Sara cries and hugs Warrick and Nick, who are standing beside her. As the episode ends, Grissom and Sara are shown togeather, in a bedroom, both wearing bathrobes and quite obviously in a relationship.\n\nCharacter Notes\n\nGrissom and Sara are in a relationship\n\n Quotes\n\nSidle: I guess I should feel comforted that sadistic ideas of beauty aren't restricted to women.  \n\n- -\n\nDavid This must be some kind of birth defect.  \nGrissom: What do you think?  \nSidle: I think I feel fat.  \n\n- -\n\nSidle: Go in for sex and get stung. Pretty much every man's fear.\n  \n- -\n\nGrissom: I don't know. Most people want to die in their sleep, I suppose. Never know that it's happening, like a crime scene. Surprise, you're dead. I'd prefer to know in advance that I was going to die. I'd like to be diagnosed with cancer actually, have some time to prepare. Go back to the rain forest one more time, re-read 'Moby Dick.' Possibly enter an international chess tournament. At least have enough time to say 'goodbye' to the ones that I love.  \nSidle: I'm not ready to say 'Goodbye.'",

When the CSIs arrive, they find a dead Hayden Bradford, who puts new meaning to the term hirsute. Hayden had Hypertrichosis, and was killed via a silver bullet through the heart.\n\nWarrick and Sara explore the inside of the house and find that a woman named Michelle (who had called Hayden 6 times that night) was in pictures and appeared to be his girlfriend. Also, casinodan@gmail.com had sent threatening emails to Dan about a debt. Outside, Catherine and Nick find a broken window, a rock with a print, and a buried gun.\n\nAt the lab, Archie traces down Casino Dan, and when Warrick and Greg interview him, he claims that Hayden had lost $10,000 on Dan's poker site. Hayden claimed credit card fraud when he started loosing and stuck Dan with the bill. After Dan leaves, Warrick notices the trace from his shoes seems to resemble that from the crime scene.\n\nThe print from the rock belongs to a man named Brent, who claims to be Hayden's best friend and Michelle's brother. When Michelle is eventually tracked down, she was brokenhearted.\n\nSofia and Sara check out the phone booth where the 911 call was made from, though Sofia arrives first and prints the booth without Sara. Sofia also points out the large quantity of hair that seems to have been 'shedded' on the ground. Sara takes this to the lab, where the hair is determined to be that of Hayden's twin sister, Allison. That said, there is no paper trail at all for Alison.\n\nBack at the house, Catherine finds a secret room in the house where the sister lives. Allison has been hiding in her room for years, never coming out and never talking to people. Her father ran off years ago and the mother was dead. When Hayden was shot, she'd been hiding in her room, and only came out at midnight to call the police, in the hopes they wouldn't find her.\n\nGrissom feels bad for Allison, sympathizing with her desire not to be seen as a freak. Nick agrees, and says that Hayden was looking for their mom, who wasn't dead but left them when the twins were teenagers. The mother comes to the station and tells Grissom that she realized she had to leave so that Allison wouldn't always depend on her, and so she faked her death. Now it was too late to go back.\n\nMeanwhile, Casino Dan's trace connects him to the crime scene. He admits he came by to hassle Hayden about the money, but only looked in the window. When Dan saw Hayden (and Hayden saw Dan), he freaked out and ran off because Hayden was a freak.\n\nThe autopsy (which takes a long time, becuase all of Hayden's hair had to be shaved off first) suggests Hayden was killed in Allison's room. A check of her room finds blood stains under the bed. Allison confesses that Hayden had actually been shot in her room: he'd come in, asked for her gun (which she'd buried outside) and then been shot. Allison saw the face of Hayden's killer reflected in her TV: Brent.\n\nBrent confesses to the murder, saying that his family blamed him for Hayden and Michelle being engaged, and he did it all to protect Michelle. Michelle admits she suspected Brent had killed Hayden, but he'd threatened her to keep her quiet.\n\nIn the end, Allison has enough money to take care of herself, but tells Catherine her greatest secret. Allison knew her mother was never dead.\n\nThe episode ends with Mrs. Bradford knocking on the door to Allison's house.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nSara's most interesting scene is when she meets Sofia by the phone booth. Sofia is irritable and pushy and angry, while Sara is mild and calm. The disparity between the characters shows a depth of calm that Sara didn't always have. Sara doesn't comment about Sofia tampering with evidence at the scene (processing when she shouldn't have been).\n\nCharacter Notes \n\nQuotes\n\nCurtis: I've been waiting for you.  \nSidle: Sorry.

The CSIs notice the previous injury patterns, and begin looking for the other girl, however most of the witnesses were drugged out of their minds. Doc Robbins quickly verifies their fears, the deceased was involved in human trafficking and was likely a sex slave.\n\nThe second girl was rescued by Kitty, a med student at the rave, who tried to calm her down enough to turn in, but not before Morgan determined Kitty had more to hide. The trauma inflicted on the girl, who understands English, brings Morgan to tears: her tongue had been removed around six months prior. The girls escaped from their kidnappers after their transport (a cattle hauler) was in an accident with a car. Drivers of haulers were matched with registered owners of the gun used, to match up with Oliver Ruiz.\n\nWhile the younger girl had no sexual trauma, she still refused to write down any information until after Morgan wrote her own down. Then she drew flowers and refused to explain. The DNA results came back to show they were sisters, which they track down to Jacinta and Rosa Flores, kidnapped a decade ago by their own mother. The father is found and brought to Las Vegas.\n\nWhen Ruiz is found and brought in, they find another girl, hiding in his hauler. This girl does not have her tongue removed, and explains Ruiz is her cousin and brought her to America. She hadn't even known the other girls were in the truck, and explains that the car that hit the hauler had run them off the road as he was chasing the girls. The Flores sisters had snuck on Ruiz's trailer to escape their circumstances. The driver had stolen Ruiz's gun and run off after the Floreses.\n\nTrace evidence left on Ruiz's shirt points to the father being the shooter. By the time they determine that, he had already removed Jacinta from the hospital. Still, they're able to track them down and arrest the father as he lights his trailer on fire with Jacinta still inside. Morgan rushes in to save her. Jacinta confirms that her mother was dead, and their father faked the kidnapping to abuse them, but Rosa tried to save her sister.\n\n Sara Sidle Review\n\nWorking a sex crime case while celebrating her anniversary long distance does not a happy Sara make. She disagrees with Doc Robbins as if the dead girl is better off dead. He feels she is, because the girl would never be whole.

Carter gets on Anspaugh's bad side when he exaggerates a patient's condition to book an operating room. Jeanie tries to keep her HIV status a secret in the face of Weaver's queries.

She's assigned to tag along with Doug, but clashes with Carol after parking her car in Carol's favored spot. The two continue to disagree, even though they went to the same Catholic school.

Mark goes to bat for Pickman when she inadvertently leaves a severely injured man at an accident scene.\n\n Character Review  \n  \nInitially Corday is asked, by Kerry, if she wants to file a complaint against Romano, since it's been mentioned he's a bit much with her. Corday brushes it off and says that some people have thin skin. Well as it turns out, the person who complained was Doyle. After being harassed by Romano, Doyle told him (off camera) to knock it off and in return, Romano threatened to 'blast her on her eval.' So Doyle went to Kerry to file a complaint and mentioned Corday. While Corday doesn't want to file a complaint, Doyle's unwillingness to back down, even at the cost of her job, seems to win Corday over, and at the end of the episode, she talks to Kerry again.\n\nCharacter Notes  \n  \nDoyle's integrity and her stubbornness of doing the right thing is not lip service, as we see her willing to risk her career to take on Romano.\n\n Quotes  \n  \nDoyle: Guess he thought anything goes with the gay chick.  \n\nhr\n\nDoyle : Self-respect is a bitch.",

Johnny Sandowski searches for a four year-old Polish girl who vanished after being separated from her mother on an &8220;El&#8221; train. Det. Bobby Davison is assigned a missing University of Chicago co-ed. Det. Sgt. Carlos Marrone tracks a patient who has possibly wandered off from the convalescence home where she lived. Carlos' wife goes into labor, so Lt. Ray McCauliffe takes over this case himself. When the wife of a National Guardsman comes in to report that her husband did not, Det. Dan Manaher sends her to Det. Connie Karadzic for help.\n\nConnie Karadzic Review\n\nDetective Connie Karadzic is met when she answers the phone for her unit. She's trying hard to get field work, but Lieutenant Ray McAuliffe claims he needs her in the office, organizing reports and gathering information for the various cases. She offers to take one of Carlos' cases, but the Lieutenant won't allow it, frustrating Connie. Ray does rely on Connie to help him research cases, but she wants more.\n\nConnie's break comes when the wife of a National Guardsman comes in to report her missing husband. With the staff already deployed, Connie takes the initial information and asks Dan Manaher if she can take the case. Ray's out, and Connie takes the case, but not after spending a few moments perfecting her greeting in the mirror. When the Lieutenant finds out, he's upset, but admits that Connie is a qualified detective, and not a secretary. Connie goes to the National Guards and determines the missing man hooked up with a girl at a jazz bar near the base, easily tracking the cheater down, though she finds it difficult to not inform the wife of her spouse's infidelity. In the end, she sets the husband up to be caught by his wife, and while Ray can't approve of it, he doesn't admonish her.\n\nBack at the station, Ray approves of her work in the field, allowing Connie to continue the work she wants to do, even taking her along to help Johnny in his armed hostage crisis.

        "content": "\nOriginally titled Pets on Your Plate, Skin Trade is a documentary.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAll of the dead animals in California -- including out pets -- along with their diseases, chemicals and drugs, toxins and bacteria, are cooked in a stew pot and rendered into protein meal and fat, and then fed to animals in the human food chain.\n\n Review\n\n The documentary film “Skin Trade”, an exposé of the fur industry, recently premiered in Los Angeles. It seems absurd that in 2010, there is a need for a documentary film about fur. Fur is one of the most obvious cruelties perpetuated against animals. It’s shocking that people still wear fur, but unfortunately they do.\n \n “Skin Trade” covers the fur industry like no other film has ever done – from the history of the fur trade to consumer fraud to the environmental toll of tanneries to truth-in-labeling legislation – and features several activists and celebrities who explain why fur sucks, such as Rory Freedman, John Feldmann, Alexandra Paul, James Cromwell, Jorja Fox, Peter Young, Matt Rossell, Ingrid Newkirk and Dennis Kucinich. An extremely well made film, “Skin Trade” is comprehensive, thought provoking, entertaining and enraging.\n \n Producer Shannon Keith, an animal rights attorney who defends activists and pursues justice for abused animals, spoke with me about the concept behind “Skin Trade,” her second documentary (her first, “Behind the Mask”, covered the animal liberation movement in the U.S. and U.K).\n \n “I wanted to make a film about an issue that is winnable for us. If we can end the fur trade, it will be one big step towards ending animal cruelty. No one can argue there’s any good reason for fur.”\n \n “Skin Trade” systematically debunks the most common myths around fur, such as warmth, fashion, and the Canadian Fur Council’s laughable “Fur is Green” campaign. The film features designer Donna Salyers, whose luxurious faux furs have the same heat retention value as animal furs. Lab tests compare the “R value” of different pile lengths, and show that animal fur and faux fur retain heat at same value.\n \n Other interviews with designer Todd Oldham, former fashion journalist Julia Szabo, and Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, reveal the economic pressures placed on designers and retailers by the fashion industry’s lust for animal fur. Oldham in particular speaks frankly about the financial consequences and the fashion magazine “media blackout” he endured when he opted to forgo fur. Another fashion scandal, well detailed in the film, erupted when clothing made in China and labeled “faux” was proven to be cat, dog, raccoon or wolf fur. Fortunately ethical style maven Joshua Katcher is on hand to provide hilarious ‘person on the street’ interviews with New Yorkers on why they wear, or don’t wear, animal fur.\n \n The claim that fur is “green” is one of the latest marketing tricks perpetuated by the fur industry. In truth processing fur uses vast amounts of water, chemicals, metals, dyes, solvents and acids. Jan Schlichtmann, an attorney whose high-profile case against corporate polluters was dramatized in the feature film “A Civil Action”, explains that leather and fur tanneries use hundreds of toxic chemicals that end up in the soil and water. Chemicals are necessary so the skin and hair does not smell, rot and decompose. (After all, it is the skin of a dead animal.) Also debunked by several experts is the fur industry’s marketing claim that they support the preservation of Native American culture and provide aid to North American tribes. Aside from rock-solid evidence from these and other authoritative sources, “Skin Trade” includes archival and new undercover footage exposing the cruelty, fraud and deceptions of fur farmers, trappers, and retailers. The film took close to three years to complete, in part because the producers insisted on presenting the most accurate and updated information on the practices used in obtaining and raising animals for fur. No film on the subject would be complete without some heartbreaking scenes of the cruel and unhealthy conditions that animals endure, and the brutal ways they are killed. Perhaps the most enraging scenes in the film are hidden-camera footage from fur salons, where people posing as customers are repeatedly told by salespeople that the animals are well cared for and that they are humanely euthanized just like a dog or cat at a veterinarian’s office. Sadly, that is nowhere near how the animals are actually killed.\n \n As difficult as it can be to watch some scenes, for Shannon Keith, making the film was itself an ordeal. “I definitely had my ups and downs. Some of the footage really got to me. We had undercover footage, shot in China, of a worker killing a dog for fur. I couldn’t function for a little while. But no matter how hard it is to watch, I owe it to each and every one of these animals that are no longer with us. I have to tell their story. I had to do it. I had no other choice. I just had to keep on going.”\n \n The most powerful documentaries alI inspire the viewer to challenge their beliefs and take action. I asked Shannon if she had any advice for people who have seen “Skin Trade.”\n \n “In the film I interviewed Representative Jim Moran, who is sponsoring a bill called The Truth in Fur Labeling Act, H.R. 2480. Currently items of clothing that cost under $150 do not have to be labeled if they are animal fur, which is how real fur was sold to consumers who thought it was faux. This bill will require every product to be accurately labeled. I suggest that people hop on this legislation right now and get on your reps to cosponsor it.”\n \n “Also, there is an anti-fur protest in practically every city all over the country every weekend. If you see someone wearing a fur coat, don’t just walk by. Ask them if they know how their fur was killed. Get the message out. There are people who just don’t know. They don’t. If they knew, they’d probably stop supporting the industry. Fur is ridiculous, cruel, not fashionable, and if you buy it, you’re being defrauded.”\n\n-- Credit: Elephant Journal",

She also talked about her roles on \"The West Wing\" and \"E/R.\" Jorja says her dream job would be appearing on TV on Animal Planet. Were the bosses listening that day?\n\n Animal Planet Radio - (10 min)\n\nSteve Dale We'll be right back with Jorja Fox on Animal Planet Radio!\n\nTheme to CSI: Who Are You?\n\nSteve Dale You've seen her on the West Wing and ER. Oh, remember that episode of Ellen? It was called the &#8216;Puppy' Episode. We'll talk about that in a second. Her name is Jorja Fox, and right now she's the hottest thing on TV. Well no, I don't mean it quite that way. Well, you know, maybe I do. You see her on CSI and she's giggling. Hey, Jorja.\n\nJorja Fox Hello, Steve. How's everything?\n\nSteve Dale Everything is great. You know, the reason why we wanted to have you on Animal Planet Radio was because I've got, right in my hand here, your bio. And it says your name, you know, and then the date of birth, which is interesting cause the year is actually on this. I don't know any other actress that does that.\n\nJorja Fox See, I'm not quite sure how that all slipped out. But it's all out in the open.\n\nSteve Dale The place of birth, and then your pets.\n\nJorja Fox No, it doesn't!\n\nSteve Dale It does! Ali the dog, a boxer, Rumplestiltskin your cat, and Sidney Potier, your cat.\n\nJorja Fox Yes.\n\nSteve Dale Well, we need to talk about this.\n\nJorja Fox Okay.\n\nSteve Dale I mean, you are a HUGE pet lover.\n\nJorja Fox Um .. I'm, I'm an extreme animal lover now. And I love you know all animals. Domestic largely, but I'm kind of an animal freak, I guess you could say.\n\nSteve Dale Well, I don't think it's a freaky thing, I think that's a great thing. Lets, you know I understand that between takes, I don't know many, you know, television scenes, exciting, and it kind of is, but you know, a lot of these shows especially those that are not sitcoms, they take a while. Yours is done in film style, movie style, and that means there's time between these takes.\n\nJorja Fox Yes.\n\nSteve Dale Things have to be set up and especially with you show, because things are so specifically detailed.\n\nJorja Fox Very visually oriented.\n\nSteve Dale Mm hm. What do you do with all that time?\n\nJorja Fox laughs That's a very good question. Well, we have all kinds of games on the set. Like chess and checkers and things like that. Match games like soccer and basketball break out. I have a big music collection in my trailer. And we're actually really lucky because we shoot a little outside of LA and we're allowed to bring our dogs to work.\n\nSteve Dale Now \"'that's\"' where I'm going.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah. Yes, exactly, so.\n\nSteve Dale So the really big game isn't chess or checkers, it's fetch.\n\nJorja Fox Mm hm. Yeah, Marg has a dog she brings sometimes. And George Eads brings his dog to work \"'every\"' day.\n\nSteve Dale Ah, you're talking about Marg Helgenberger.\n\nJorja Fox Yes, Marg Helgenberger is on the show.\n\nSteve Dale And?\n\nJorja Fox And George Eads. And his dog, Maverick, is there every day. If he's there, Maverick's there. And I bring my dog, I'd say, you know about once every couple of weeks. I- I bring her if I have a shorter day. Because I have two cats, she has company at home. So unless- If I'm there for a couple of hours or less, I have the time. If it gets to be a long day then laughs she's ready to come home, you know, before I am. That's a lot of fun, and it's a big gift too. That's not often, I mean you see that on some sets sometimes, but it's rare on a show that people are allowed to bring their pets.\n\nSteve Dale Well, and those names of your pets intrigue me. Ali, named after the boxer?\n\nJorja Fox Mm hm.\n\nSteve Dale Really?\n\nJorja Fox All three of them, of my animals, came with their names. Sid Potier, actually was originally named Sid Vicious. And I quit calling him that, sort of altered that name, because he was inheriting his namesake a little bit, and I thought that maybe. And kind of the funny thing about that after he became Sid Potier, he did sort of relax. He's very debonair now.\n\nSteve Dale He's a much better actor.\n\nJorja Fox He's a perfect gentleman.\n\nSteve Dale Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox And, ah, Ali was named after the great Muhammad Ali.\n\nSteve Dale Mm hm.\n\nJorja Fox Who, who was I to change their names? And I actually love all of their names.\n\nSteve Dale Where did you get your dog, Ali, the Boxer, from?\n\nJorja Fox Ah, um. Ali was a personal rescue, actually. I had a friend who couldn't keep her, and she was about ten months old. He had heard that I just moved out to LA and had a small yard and he called me and I said sure, that I would take her. She sort of came with an expiration date. That after six months, if I wasn't completely satisfied, that he was moving out to LA, and he would take her. And, ah, you know, of course, I fell madly in love. I think it took all of about a week. Ali was one of the best decisions I ever made.\n\nSteve Dale You know, they say that. And I used to do a lot of celebrity interviews, and I would talk, eventually, because I'm me, with the celebrities, about their pets.\n\nJorja Fox Right.\n\nSteve Dale And one of my favorite questions was-\n\nJorja Fox Even before Animal Planet?\n\nSteve Dale Yeah! Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox Which I'm a huge fan of, by the way.\n\nSteve Dale Well, thank you! Thank you very much. Well I wanna know if your dog's personality, in any way, reflects yours?\n\nJorja Fox Um laughs Well. People say that.\n\nSteve Dale Really?\n\nJorja Fox Definitely say that. And that's the thing I've been intrigued with for a long time too, cause I notice dogs, I think in particular, that are with owners or human companions, or whatever you want to call them, you know, the two personalities definitely seem to blend. The question to me has always been &#8216;has it been the dog the takes on the human personality, or the human takes on the dog personality.' laughs And it's kind of a brilliant thing. But yeah, so I've heard. I've heard that we look alike, I've heard that we have definitely similar personality traits.\n\nSteve Dale Mm hm. Have you always been this huge animal lover?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, I mean, matter of fact, even as a kid, I grew up in a small, beach town in Florida, and there was more wildlife there than there probably were humans. At that time, things have changed, sort of a bit. My grandmother, who's 98, is a huge environmentalist, and has always been very, ah, very sort of tuned in to the natural world.\n\nSteve Dale Hmm.\n\nJorja Fox And I think, as a young kid, I, um I really wanted to be like a marine biologist, or work with wildlife, more than I wanted to do anything else. And as I got older, you know, my science skills are really weak, which is also sort of iran- ironic cause I'm playing a scientist laughs right now on television!\n\nSteve Dale Yeah, now you weren't supposed to tell me that.\n\nJorja Fox laughs Science and math. It sort of became clear to me, probably around Jr. High or High School, that I might not make it! You know? Like I would love to do it as a career, work with wildlife, but the actual mechanics of getting a degree might not really be in my future.\n\nSteve Dale You know what would really be cool? And you never know who's listening to this show, wouldn't it be great if you hosted a show on Animal Planet? Where you didn't have to really know the science?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah!\n\nSteve Dale But you did have to use your ability, well you know, talk into that camera or that camera. And read off cue cards and do all the things that you can do. And- And and I don't mean that in a bad way! And still be able to go out and do things, like, with dolphin show trainers. And go to, maybe, a rain forest somewhere. Wouldn't that be great?\n\nJorja Fox Steve, you know, if that could be in my future, I would be absolutely thrilled. That would be amazing.\n\nSteve Dale Okay! Let's say, alright, this is your- remember &#8216;I Dream of Jeanie'?\n\nJorja Fox Mm hm.\n\nSteve Dale Okay.\n\nJorja Fox Actually, I grew up ten minutes from the town where &#8216;I Dream of Jeanie' took place, Coco Beach, Florida.\n\nSteve Dale Alright, so you are now Jeanie. And you can cross your arms like Barbara Eden used to do, and close your eyes and, and all and make a wish for a TV Show. I mean, after CSI runs its very long and healthy course. Which we want.\n\nJorja Fox laughs Thank you.\n\nSteve Dale What would that show be? Would it be a sitcom, would it be really a nature show?\n\nJorja Fox Um yeah, I mean I would love to go out into the world, and sort of, you know, meet animals where they live and where they are naturally. I think that would be the all time greatest job. That was my hope, you know, even if it was being a wildlife photographer or that, where I could go to the places where animals are. That would be good.\n\nSteve Dale You know, one thing I learned about this business: You say it, and it can happen. You do, you never know who's listening. But the first job, or one of the first times that we became familiar with you, Jorja Fox, was on &#8216;Ellen.' They call that last show, and you'll have to explain something to me, and if it's filthy, don't explain it. Why is that last show refereed to, like on all the websites? As-\n\nJorja Fox As &#8216;The Puppy Episode.'\n\nSteve Dale Yeah!\n\nJorja Fox I wish that I had a great answer to that question, and that's something I've always wanted to personally ask Ellen myself.\n\nSteve Dale Is it something you can say on the radio, do you think?\n\nJorja Fox I, well, I don't even know the answer.\n\nSteve Dale You have no idea.\n\nJorja Fox And I know that it is absolutely a term of endearment. That it's an inside joke, that there's an inside story to why it was called &#8216;The Puppy Episode.' Obviously there's no puppies in that episode. And there's really, I don't think there's any reference to any type of animals at all. But, ah, it's quite possibly, when Ellen was writing the show with the writers, you know, something that came, that was very personal to them, which you know at least that has in common with that episode. It was a show that was extremely personal to Ellen.\n\nSteve Dale I want to talk about CSI for a second. I mean, you are now probably being heard all over the nation, all over America, but I'm from Chicago and there's a Chicago connection: William Petersen's on the show.\n\nJorja Fox Yes, he is.\n\nSteve Dale And he has something in common with you, because you have roots in the theater and so does he, I know.\n\nJorja Fox Yes. Absolutely. William Petersen is maybe one of my all time heroes. And, ah, he is from Chicago, he spent most of his break in Chicago. We've just come off break. So we had six weeks to sort of go away and do whatever we wanted to do.\n\nSteve Dale You know, I've referred to him as, ah, er, others have referred to him as an actor's actor. I don't know quite ever what that means. Maybe you can explain it to me.\n\nJorja Fox loud laughter Oh, I think that's very specific right now, because he's producing [[CSI]] as well. So he's wearing two hats and, ah, as a producer, um, probably his number one concern, I think, that he looks after, is the actors on the show. And, um, he kind of once said to me that he wouldn't know how to work if it wasn't a collaborative process. Which is something that is extremely common, coming out of theater. If you work, you know, working on plays, two months of rehearsing, it becomes very much this collective of what people want to do. So that's how he works, and it's kind of unique to television, and um, everybody supported that. I think that they knew when they got William Petersen and he would be involved, that that's how the show would go. It's a very, very special thing.\n\nSteve Dale Well, CSI's become a very special thing, a very successful show. Wouldn't be that without you, Jorja Fox, thanks for sharing some time and talking about your best friends with four legs.\n\nJorja Fox laughs Thank you so much!\n\nTheme to CSI: Who Are You?\n\nSteve Dale Jorja Fox promoting the Pounce Purr-fections, that's a new cat treat, and Jorja was involved in a promotion to benefit the ASPCA.

        "content": "\nActor/executive producer William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and executive producer Carol Mendelsohn point out the reasons they brought Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) onto the show.\n\nWhy Jorja Fox?\n\nWilliam Petersen: It was very interesting. Here was this young girl who was basically a rookie. And she comes out and we basically ignore her through out the night because we were too busy doing our stuff. And to have her get shot at the end of a pilot was somewhat profound. And then to have her die in the first episode was even more profound. And consequently that's how we got Jorja to come in from San Francisco. Called up Sara Sidle to come in and investigate it. And I think it ended up being- putting right off the bat- a sort of like profundity to something that- you know- to guys collecting evidence. They are in harms way a lot, these guys, which is why they're allowed to wear [guns]. And they're civilians. They're not cops. They work for the police and they're in harms way a lot. And this was one way to show that they were.\n\nCarol Mendelsohn: And speaking to that question from the perspective of the writers, Anthony and Ann, jump in, it's interesting the response of the audience to that character in the pilot. We created a character that could come in, like the audience, and see everything new and learn along with the CSIs. And in the end, there was an audience reaction that she was not up to the job. That she didn't know enough, and we realized we needed to bring in a young woman that was really smart and knew what she was doing, and was eager and said \"Cool\" every time there was a case. And that's Sara Sidle.\n\nAnthony Zuiker: It was a very gut wrenching to make- to do. It was a very risky decision to make. And it was very unexpected.\n\nPetersen Et Al On The Science Of The Scripts##\n\n[...]\n\nWilliam Peteresen: It's not like dialogue we're used to doing as actors, you know. I mean, it's very complex, scientific stuff. Half the time, we don't even know what we're saying. We don't even know how to pronounce the words. But I'll tell you, it's fascinating, keeps you - I mean, Jorja, we had that whole thing with the last one.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\n[...]\n\nCarol Mendelsohn: Once in a while an actor will call from the set because they don't know how to pronounce a word, or they ask where a certain body part is. And we pretend that we actually know. [...] We have a - One of our co-producers, Josh Berman, his father is a doctor and occasionally with Latin phrases, Josh gets on the phone with his father while I'm on the phone with the set.\n\nJorja Fox: I've called with French words before.\n\n[...]",

I think I uh, I think I dozed off for a little while.\n\nInterviewer: What was it like working with Chris Nolan [director of \"Memento\"]?\n\nJorja Fox: Amazing. He's very generous, really intelligent, whip smart... I read the script like three times and I still didn't know what the movie was about, and he very simply sat down and sort of explained to me, and it did \"change\", there were several incarnations of what the movie might be, and that's one of the most exciting things I think about working with him, because it's like a &#8216;lightning mind' syndrome, and um, yet very communcative at the same time. So it's kinda rare in a movie.\n\nInterviewer: What was it like working with Guy Pearce?\n\nJorja Fox: \"(smiling)\" I \"love\" Guy Pearce, yeah. Um... he's... incredibly handsome, an incredible actor, so very kind and sweet, and uh, grounded, he has a very grounded presence. Because so much of the movie is so dark, and yet here he had this sort of light, ethereal energy that he brought with him to the whole cast. Cause you can start to get a little, you know, after a long day you can start to drag down and you're like &#8216;why am I depressed?', you know, and he brought that energy and enthusiasm with him all the time.\n\nInterviewer: What other projects are you working on, what are you working on next?\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, currently I'm working on a show called \"CSI:\", uh, and that's really, there's no &#8216;next' at the moment, we finish in May and we've been working since last July, so next might be a slow trip somewhere, far away, from you know, once we make hiatus, I might just do that.\n\nInterviewer: What's the show about?\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, it's about crime scene investigators, actually, so I feel like I have made a complete circle; I played a victim in this movie and on \"CSI:\" I'm a forensic scientist and a criminalist who investigates what happened to people like me in \"Memento\".\n\nInterviewer: Well thank you so much.

No.\n\nCraig: Just about.\n\nJorja: Can I touch you? I had a really, really great couple of years. \"(laughter)\"\n\nCraig: Tell them where you filmed \"C.S.I.\"\n\nJorja: We shoot in the glamorous city of Valencia, California and occasionally we go to Las Vegas.\n\nCraig: You spend a lot of the time in Vegas.\n\nJorja: Yeah.\n\nCraig: Where do they put you up?\n\nJorja: We have a choice. We have condos or a couple of hotels.\n\nCraig: What do you choose?\n\nJorja: The fancy hotels as much as possibly.\n\nCraig: Do you gamble?\n\nJorja: I might a little bit. The great thing about going to work is you have the excuse you can only do in Vegas because you're working so I have to go to the slot machine. You get a free drink.\n\nCraig: They bring the drinks around all the time. There free hoping that you'll gamble all night. You'll catch that little buzz. I think you can say buzz on TV.\n\nJorja: Is that why they bring the drinks?\n\nCraig: They don't have a clock so you don't know it's 6:00 a.m.\n\nJorja: There's oxygen everywhere.\n\nCraig: There's oxygen and the whole thing.\n\nJorja: I didn't know they brought you free drinks so that they keep you gambling.\n\nCraig: I'm just guessing. Why do you think because you're a pretty girl they bring you free drinks?\n\nJorja: I love Vegas.\n\nCraig: Speaking of being a pretty girl, years ago you use to hang out in Italy.\n\nJorja: Yeah, how did you know about that?\n\nCraig: Because they told me years ago you were the modeling type. You use to model in Italy.\n\nJorja: I was an imposter model in Italy when I was a teenager. Yes, for a short period of time.\n\nCraig: How did you find Italy? Did you like it?\n\nJorja: I loved Italy. It's an amazing, beautiful, incredible, everything is beautiful in it.\n\nCraig: Right, its beautiful. The men are-\n\nJorja: The dogs are beautiful, yeah the man are pretty beautiful.\n\nCraig: The men are very aggressive but I heard the food is amazing.\n\nJorja: Yes, Can you tell? I'm just back from Italy actually. I weigh seven pounds heavier than when I left, which is great, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nCraig: You're bulked up. Look at that. whoa! Surprised you fit that skirt there.\n\nJorja: You have to wear baggy clothes that's the trick.\n\nCraig: So you went years ago and meet some gentlemen when you were there.\n\nJorja: \"(stammering)\" Ah, Ah, Maybe! Yeah, one or two guys, I mean I was there for along time it wasn't like I was there for a couple of weeks.\n\nCraig: And were they romantic? How were they?\n\nJorja: Oh yeah, everything's romance, passion and beauty and-\n\nCraig: What was it? What would they do? What were some of the things?\n\nJorja: Well, they would take me to a bar.\n\nCraig: Oooh. There, right.\n\nJorja: We'd have some peanuts and you know it's great, very high class.\n\nCraig: You went recently. You just got back from a trip.\n\nJorja: I went vacation this year. I was in Italy for two weeks with two days in Croatia and a day in Greece.\n\nCraig: Did you meet any interesting people? Did you go by yourself?\n\nJorja: No, I went with my friend Suzanne [Mara]. The two of us went together.\n\nCraig: There you have it, right there, that's all you need to know.\n\nJorja: And we meet no one. No I did, I met an old lady on the train. \"(laughter)\"\n\nCraig: There, there, there, that's her!\n\nJorja: There she is and her dog. \"(applause)\"\n\nCraig: How did that go?\n\nJorja: We didn't know what to say because my Italian is fairly limited. Just Caio.\n\nCraig: You do a lot of this then? A lot of Petting? \"(hand movements)\"\n\nJorja: Yes, the funny thing is you don't know the language so you start using your hands all the time for everything which is embarrassing. Talk loud and do things like this thinking people will know what your saying. \"(more hand movements)\"\n\nCraig: Why would she talk to you then. If you couldn't talk? Why would she spend so much time with you?\n\nJorja: We didn't talk that long actually. I would have talked longer with her but-\n\nCraig: So when you say you meet her, you just took her picture to show people, so that in case you went on a talk show, to prove that you went to Italy.\n\nJorja: Actually I internetted that. I was home late last night and pulled it off.\n\nCraig: They also tell me, this is interesting. What did you do this weekend? I didn't get the story, they said just ask her about it.\n\nJorja: My friend John and I decided to walk the mountaintops from town, from Hollywood, all the way to the ocean. We heard it could be done.\n\nCraig: This is from the mountaintops up in the Hollywood hills?\n\nJorja: Yes, So if you're from Los Angeles you would start at the top of Runyun and then go to the Tree People, there's sort of all these trails that connect but they don't really connect all the way. So that's Hitch #1.\n\nCraig: How do you get across the 405?\n\nJorja: \"(laughing)\" That was Hitch #2. Then we thought we'll just walk Mulholland, we could do that, then we decided not to do that because we're gonna do this big hike and it would be a way, basically we were going to do a 13 mile hike on Friday and we did 7 miles \"(looks embarrassed)\". It was 97 degrees on Friday.\n\nCraig: It was very hot. How many hours was it then?\n\nJorja: Uh. 4 hours.\n\nCraig: 4 hours of walking.\n\nJorja: So the 13 miles, we could have done in 8 hours but the Gatorade ran out, the water ran out.\n\nCraig: But it was an adventure and you went for it and it was a waste of time.\n\nJorja: Well yeah, I'm into wildlife. I like to see wildlife which is one of the reason I'm here tonight. \"(laughter, cheering, applause)\"\n\nCraig: Finally, finally at the end she got me. I was waiting for that.\n\nJorja: And I'm bad at it too.\n\nCraig: Yeah, I know. Did I give you that line?\n\nJorja: No, no, backstage they gave it to me, they gave me this card.\n\nCraig: Ok, we're out of time surprisingly. Good luck with C.S.I. It's a huge, huge show.\n\nJorja: Thank you. We had a good year, a really good year and we will be back. More dead people.\n\nCraig: Lets hear it for Jorja Fox!  ",

But you know, the last few years couldn't have sucked... In the 99-00 season, she portrayed Secret Service Special Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing, protecting President Bartlet's youngest daughter.

Thanks for joining our chat today with Jorja Fox. Prior to her casting on CSI, Jorja had a recurring role of Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on The West Wing and prior to that she was Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER. She's also got a role in the cool new flick \"Memento.\"\n\ny_chat_diva: Hello everyone, thanks for joining us. Jorja Fox is our guest. She is here and we're almost ready to start, remember, she can only get the questions you type in the \"ask a question\" box. So be sure you use that box to talk to Jorja.\n\ny_chat_diva: Okay, let's go. Please welcome Jorja Fox to Yahoo! Chat. Hello and welcome.\n\njorja_fox_chat: Thanks for hanging out! And I'm excited to talk to everybody...\n\nSEZARIN: tell me how did you started in this business\n\njorja_fox_chat: Oh boy! I knew when I was like five that I wanted to be an actress, and I was one of those kids that would put on shows for anyone in the neighborhood or my family that would watch them! I grew up in a really small town and when I was 16 I moved to New YOrk City. I took classes in New York, and I was really lucky because the first agency I went to had a sign on the door that said &8216;Do Not Enter, Just Leave Your Package,' and I pretended that I didn't see it, and I walked in and they let me in. I was 20 when that happened, and I had been there for about four years distracted.... And they sent me out on auditions. The first movie I got was called The Kill-Off, and then I didn't work again for about a year after that. And that's how I got started I guess...\n\nipstenu: You said that you wish you were a vegan (in the Venice Magazine article from April 2001), why?\n\njorja_fox_chat: LOL! I think ultimately because it's an even better way to practice pacifism, but it's really hard on sets to be a strict vegan. So even though I don't eat a lot of dairy, I'll eat things that have dairy products in them like bread, cake, pasta, stuff like that.\n\ndogcat_8: Hello Jorja! I love the show and I was wondering...Have you taken an interest in the work of a CSI being exposed to all the technical terms and tools that go with the job?\n\njorja_fox_chat: Yes. I've always been interested in real crime, and the psychology of criminal behavior, and sci fi. And the horror genre. So it's something that I've continued to be interested in, I read all the time stuff that applies to that and also watch stuff on TV that everybody watches, like The New Detectives... It's actually really good.\n\nscottyameron4life: are there going to be more seasons of csi\n\njorja_fox_chat: Not officially. But we've done a couple of publicity things that people don't usually get to do unless they've been renewed. I think it's fairly safe to say that we'll be on next year.\n\nsawas_sweetheart78:  ",

        "content": "\nLARRY KING, HOST: Tonight, unsolved mysteries, Jon Bonet Ramsey, Chandra Levy &#8212; in the news. No wonder one of TV's top drama's is \"CSI Crime Scene Investigation\". This phenomenal series is about following evidence and closing cases. Glory details, high tech twists, it got them all.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: But, how realistic are the corpses and the clues?  \nJoining us from LA, stars from the gripping show, killing the competition, and from Detroit, world renowned forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee, with insights on \"CSI's\" accuracy and high profile real life crimes, and it's all next on LARRY KING WEEKEND. \"CSI\" has been extraordinarily popular, and surprising hit on CBS every Thursday night at 9:00. What a cast, and what an idea. The concept is \"CSI\" and the cast joins us, William PETERSEN who plays Gil Grissom, the Senior Forensic Officer heading the team Criminalistics Bureau in Los Vegas. Marg Helgenberger plays Catherine Willows, she's a top member of that team, also a single mom and a former stripper &#8212; cover every angle. Jorja Fox plays Sara Sidle; Sara is an intensely focused member of the team; sometimes seems that work is her whole life. Gary Dourdan &#8212; Dourdan, rather, plays Warrick Brown on \"CSI\", Warrick's another member of the team of criminalistics, he's highly competitive, he's a talented jazz musician, and has had a gambling problem. This is covering every base known to man. And Elizabeth Devine, story editor and technical consultant for \"CSI\", veteran criminalist, worked 15 years in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, has a BA in Biology and a Master's in criminalistics, and in Detroit, a frequent guest on this program, Dr. Henry Lee, the world renowned forensic expert, the Chief emeritus for Scientific Services, and the former Commissioner of Public Safety for the state of Connecticut, his new book is \"Cracking Cases, the Science of Solving Crimes.\" Elizabeth, were you involved in this, from the get go?\n\nELIZABETH DEVINE, STORY EDITOR AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANT, CSI: Yes, not with the pilot, but I've been involved with every single show.\n\nKING: How'd they get you involved William?\n\nWILLIAM PETERSEN, ACTOR, CSI: Well, Anthony Zukier, who came up with the idea, pitched me the story and I just fell for it, big time.\n\nKING: You liked it right away.\n\nPETERSEN: Yes.\n\nKING: Marg?\n\nMARG HELGENBERGER, ACTRESS, CSI: It was a pilot script that my agent tipped me off too, a couple years ago and said, \"This is the one to go after, if you want &#8212; if you're interested\", and I, you know, read it immediately and said, \"You're right\", and I just &#8212; I had a really strong feeling about this show.\n\nKING: You did, so did William. What about you Gary?\n\nGARY DOURDAN, ACTOR, CSI: A &#8212; Billy gave me the job.\n\nKING: Billy is William.\n\nDOURDAN: Yes.\n\nKING: We &#8212; they call you Billy?\n\nDOURDAN: Les Moonev, William Petersen, Anthony Zukier, they had a lot to do with me, getting the gig, fantastic reading, fantastic script, easily to get involved with, right away.\n\nKING: You like it right away?\n\nDOURDAN: Right away.\n\nKING: Jorja?\n\nJORJA FOX, ACTRESS, CSI: Actually I joined the show, when Liz joined the show in episode one, I was, sort of, a last minute cast edition to the show, and I came mesmerized also, completely &#8212; it's like a trance, I think that a lot of us go under and &#8212; yes, so, I joined the show late, my typical standards.\n\nKING: Dr. Lee, what is a criminal list?\n\nHENRY LEE, FORENSIC EXPERT: A criminal is a person working laboratory, crime laboratory, or police department, search the crime scene, examine the physical evidence, but all the criminal goes to the crime scene. Some just work in the laboratory examine the evidence. Other does the crime scene analysis, not like their \"CSI\", they dust the crime scene, or so examine the evidence.\n\nKING: Is this called forensics?\n\nLEE: Forensic, yes, this is part of forensic. Forensic is a really major area, they have so many specialty areas, such as the forensic medicine; dealing with live patients, forensic pathology does the autopsy, forensic old um college, deal with the dental evidence ...\n\nKING: Does every big police department have criminalists.\n\nLEE: Yes, big departments, every state will have a crime laboratory.\n\nKING: What we're going to do now is just show you a scene from one of the \"CSI's\" to give you a little framework here, and then we're going to delve into lots of aspects, so watch.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: Bill Petersen, how much did you get to learn about your &#8212; about this craft from play it?\n\nPETERSEN: The great thing about the show is, we learn everyday.\n\nKING: You do.\n\nPETERSEN: Absolutely. It's really one of the reasons that I wanted to do it, quite frankly. I was always terrified that if I got on television that I did a role, that I would be doing the same thing everyday, possibly for years, and I wouldn't be able to grow, or to learn anything. This provided the opportunity to learn something everyday.\n\nKING: Your character is very intense, is he not?\n\nPETERSEN: Yes.\n\nKING: Would you describe him as?\n\nPETERSEN: Yes, I think he's in love with his work, and he puts that probably most above everything.\n\nKING: Marg, how do you see your person you play?\n\nHELGENBERGER: Unlike Billy's character who is an entomologist, in addition to being a criminalist, I came to this career through another path. And I just think that, the path that she took is, kind of, interesting, and that' the thing of the exotic dancer. But I've learned an enormous amount of &#8212; about criminalist terminology, forensic science, since starting this show, and as Billy said, every day we learn something new &#8212; and all the words are spelled out phonetically for us. And Liz is standing by to give us the definition of what we're talking about.\n\nKING: By the way Liz, is everything on the show correct, or do they take literary license.\n\nDEVINE: Well, we have to do some literary license, we do &#8212; speed things up for television, but everything scientifically we try to keep as accurate as possible and do a lot of research and try to help our actors know that what they're saying is the real thing.\n\nKING: Do criminalists solve crimes?\n\nDEVINE: I think criminalists play a huge part in solving crimes, and juries expect forensics now, and you really can't solve a crime without forensic science these days.\n\nKING: Gary, how do you approach Warrick?\n\nDOURDAN: I think I liken my character to Marg's, there's a certain street life sensibility, sort of, informedness , being out on the field.\n\nKING: What attracts him to this work?\n\nDOURDAN: Well, I think that's the two parts of the scientific part of it, and also the laymen's part of it. It almost a detective, kind of, figuring things out by a hunch and backing it up by science.\n\nKING: But you're around a lot of gory things here.\n\nDOURDAN: Yes.\n\nKING: Jorja, how do you see Sara?\n\nFOX: Sara is very intense. She might be a little excessive compulsive; she has a great amount of patience with focus and detail. I think it's funny, because Michelle , we learn so much everyday on the show, but so much of it goes into my short-term memory, because something that I'm memorizing for acting and I wish I retained more. I come to loose all the highlights. What was that thing we did two months ago, that I forgot to &#8212; I answered it out so I could learn that new thing.\n\nKING: We'll talk about why their show's a hit, other things they do, as we wend our way through \"CSI\", the end of a season of extraordinary success, don't go away.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: We're back with the cast of \"CSI\", and we want all of your opinions on this, why is it a hit William? No one forecasted it, it was supposed to be the fugitive right, the big CBS hit.\n\nPETERSEN: I believe CBS thought the &#8212; it would be the fugitive ...\n\nKING: They did not think \"CSI\" would be a hit, I mean they were happy of course.\n\nPETERSEN: I'm sure not, but &#8212; I don't know, I always thought it was going to be a hit because &#8212; I did a movie several years ago, called \"Man Hunter\", which was based on a Thomas Harris ...\n\nKING: Hannibal Lector's first introduction to us.\n\nPETERSEN: And people, for years, had been talking about &#8212; to me about that, and about that and, you know, the science that goes into finding these people and in that case it was profiling, criminal profiling, which is very different than what we're doing. But, I just knew that there was a &#8212; especially since the O.J. trial, there was this language out there, that I'm not sure that the public was versed in, but they knew what exactly was ...\n\nKING: That's correct, so wouldn't you have bet then, it would have been hard then to be a hit when you're saying a lot of words, we don't know what you're talking about.\n\nPETERSEN: Well, I think what we want to know is what are they talking about? And so I think, people watch our show on the edge of their sofa's as opposed to lounging at that .\n\nKING: Marg, why do you think it's a hit?\n\nHELGENBERGER: I think it's a hit for many reasons. I think that foremost, I think that it's a great mystery, and I think that mysteries will always be successful, because people are always intrigued by them.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nHELGENBERGER: The use of the special affects, which actually help people understand the science. I think that's why school children and teenage kids are so compelled by the show and they are inspires to become criminalists, because of the way we utilize the science.\n\nKING: You think you inspire people to ...\n\nHELGENBERGER: I know, I have. I've had teenagers come to me, or parents of teenagers come up to me and say, \"My child is changed or I'm changing what I want to do for the rest of my life\", or whatever, what does an 18 &#8212; 17 year old know for ...\n\nKING: Gary, why do you think the public has responded?\n\nDOURDAN: I would echo, just what they've said, I think that, I've said it before that this is an information age, we have a lot of shows that are going into discoveries of nature, and I think this is a great timing for it. And I think that it's never going to go anywhere, we had Sherlock Holmes that's still very available and accessible.\n\nKING: And it's still though Jorja, it has to be a good story, right? To get all the rest, you have to have who, what, where, when, why.\n\nFOX: The writers and research department, and our technical advisors, I think every weekend end it , to make a plot suspenseful. I think of our show as an actual adventure show, and even though there's not a lot of car chases or things like, there's a pacing where people, there's a suspense that people are, kind of, wondering what happened. And I think we're also really lucky that we're on the cutting edge of this technology, and things are happening everyday, stuff is coming out that will allow us to have new tricks coming out of our pockets for a long time .\n\nKING: And now a key moment in the show, Dr. Lee; what do you think of \"CSI\"?\n\nLEE: \"CSI\" is an excellent show. As a matter of fact, many detectives also watch, today I was selected to allow the detective from Detroit Michigan, even some from Hawaii, to attend a practical homicide-training seminar. I did a survey and asked them, \"How many of you watching CSI?\" It was surprising to me, almost the majority of the class. So, they did like the show, but sometime they say, little bit far from reality.\n\nKING: What do you say?\n\nLEE: One of the detective will tell, he got into a lot of troubles, and the chief went out and bought a license for him, and he went to couple crime scenes and not found any evidence, the chief started yelling at him, \"CSI\" detective want all of those evidence. We spent so much money and bought you this license . What did you do with that? Interesting show, the people liked it because after O.J. Simpson, Jon Bonet Ramsey, Vincent Foster case, the public dying for the reality show. This case, of course, it's more in reality sense, compared to many other police show, because many time, you know, by second commercial, you guys already found the clue. We have to work years, years, before we found any lead.\n\nKING: And that's as Elizabeth said, right, you have to speed the process up.\n\nLEE: Yes. I really think Bill and Jorja say something really profound, very good, say everyday learn something, and I be in this business 45 years now, everyday I'm still learning. Like every time, lectured to the detective, the day you start, feel you know everything, that's the time you should retire.\n\nKING: Those are &#8212; take real life stories, right Marg, stories that happened in real life and translate, as \"Law & Order\" does.\n\nHELGENBERGER: Yes.\n\nKING: You did the one with the homeless, right, person in there, right, and the killing by the women in the car in the windshield. So, you will take stories out of the newspaper and transform them into a fictionalized hour.\n\nFOX: Absolutely, and true things that people do to each other are much more interesting than anything we could think up, so.\n\nPETERSEN: We have real stories that have happened out there, that our writers will go, we'll never be able to do that, they'll think we made this up.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: Have all of you been to a morgue.\n\nFOX: Yes.\n\nDOURDAN: Yes.\n\nHELGENBERGER: Yes.\n\nKING: Have you looked at like, dead bodies. I mean have you had to do this?\n\nHELGENBERGER: Yes.\n\nFOX: Yes, I've looked at dead bodies.\n\nHELGENBERGER: I've only seen one dead body in a morgue, and it was not intact, in other words it was a &#8212; it was a heart attack victim.\n\nKING: I see, have you seen ...\n\nPETERSEN: I have not been through an ...\n\nKING: Autopsy. Anybody. How about some of the scenes where you have to portray like you're looking at, is that hard?\n\nPETERSEN: I think our makeup people and the actors that come to play our dead people are amazing.\n\nKING: They're a dead beat.\n\nPETERSEN: They're amazing. We'll do a scene &#8212; we will be doing a scene and the coroner's lab and the actor will be on the slab for an hour while we setup the lights and do all of that stuff, we'll forget that the person, is an actual living person.\n\nHELGENBERGER: Well, you know, we get asked that question a lot, about is it gory for you all? But &#8212; first &#8212; these actors are all made up as corpses, but then they'll like poke their head in and they'll say, \"Hey, you guys where's craft service?\", you know, so it just breaks the illusion, but when you actually see it on air, or a tape of the program, I'm sometimes, it's like too intense for me. So, it's when you in the moment, it doesn't really phase you, and I imagine it might be something when you're actually working, and you don't have time to think about it, but when you see it after the fact, it's ...\n\nKING: We'll take a break and be back with lots more about \"CSI\", don't go away.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: Dr. Lee, how realistic is the realism.\n\nLEE: Well, its pretty real, and of course, just talking, you guys talk about a morgue, autopsy &#8212; day before yesterday I was in Detroit with Dr. Wack , we went to the autopsy room to dissecting some bodies, just look at it, you know, nobody enjoy to see others misfortune. But, on the other hand, we can't stop to feel sympathize to the victim or so the smell of the morgue, the death, it's kind of relapse thing . I still remember the first homicide, when 40 some years ago, is a dismembering case, after work on that case for months, I don't like to eat meat. I almost become a vegetarian. Reality and the show, of course, is still a little bit apart, but the reality usually it's a teamwork. We need more people, we have the first police officer detective, laboratory scientist, medical examiner, district attorney, everybody have to work together, so important.\n\nKING: From what this case, wouldn't you say that the Ramsey case was a classic example of poor criminalist work at the scene?\n\nDEVINE: Yes, I'm not sure they had criminalists at the scene.\n\nLEE: Yes, they do, they did have some Sheriff Department, forensic people on border police department and detective dust the crime scene.\n\nDEVINE: Well, it's a lot different to do &#8212; what did they have no murders, a couple of murders in three years versus, you know what we say in LA county, where our criminalists do go into the crime scenes, collect the evidence, come back and analyze it, and you can only get good at that, the more you do it. So, it's skill takes repetitiveness and going out to the crime scenes a lot and I think there were some problems, definitely problems with that case.\n\nLEE: When you have to work together, but the many laboratory criminals doesn't go to the scene. Many time the detective goes to the scene, however they don't training in CSI .\n\nKING: That's what I question when I watch the show sometimes; do criminalists &#8212; are always go to the scene? Do you know?\n\nDEVINE: It depends on the jurisdiction, it depends on the department.\n\nPETERSEN: It also depends on whether they are qualified to go to the scene. They're in different stages of their development.\n\nKING: Now, how do you approach it as an actor, when you come to the scene, how do you see &#8212; your role is what there? It's a mystery to you, right?\n\nPETERSEN: Well, its &#8212; we all know the scripts in advance, we've read the whole thing. So, the goal as an actor, is to try and make sure we don't get ahead of what we know, of what the character knows. So, the character has to play the mystery. The actor knows what's happening.\n\nKING: You might shoot a last scene first, depending on what's set up that day right?\n\nFOX: You can shoot a show in the morning, and start a new show in the afternoon, and so &#8212; I think that's really keeping the scenes together, in your head, and knowing where you're coming from and where you're supposed to be going, what stage of the case are you in, and that can get a little ...\n\nKING: It can drive you nuts?\n\nHELGENBERGER: It can drive you a little crazy, especially if there's script changes on a &#8212; from a scene to scene basis, which happens from time to time.\n\nKING: When you watch the finished show then, are you often surprised?\n\nHELGENBERGER: Oh, always surprised, because there's many things that we are not at all involved with. All the special effects, that's all done in a computer graphics place called Stargate , and some of the things they come up with are ingenious, and it's so amusing sometimes. That's where a lot of the black humor comes in.\n\nKING: Are you involved in the editing Elizabeth? Are you in that room?\n\nDEVINE: Very infrequently, sometimes I'm there.\n\nKING: So therefore, you're surprised too, when you watch it.\n\nDEVINE: I sometimes am. I &#8212; often they bring me in just to look at the way they set up a special affect, for instance when you go into the body, that we're going past the right organs and it's not, we're not breaking a rib, when we're supposed to be breaking a knee cap, you know, that sort of thing. But, most of the time they do it on their own, and they're really very talented.\n\nKING: Dr. Lee, is a lot of this work, team work?\n\nLEE: Yes, there a lot of team work in real crime laboratory, also a lot of teamwork. However, many time we don't produce result in second commercial, that's one big problem. The public really enjoy the shows and got a lot of phone calls saying \"CSI\" people can do it and why don't you guys do it. That's kind of put us in a little bit difficulty, I like to invite the cast to Connecticut to see our laboratory or also University of New Haven , we have the Institute of Forensic Science. If any of you interested to come, you are welcome.\n\nHELGENBERGER: Wow, thank you.\n\nDEVINE: That's very nice.\n\nPETERSEN: We'll be there.\n\nKING: Write a script where there's a certain crime in Connecticut and you can't solve it. Dr. Lee could be in it, and he calls on the \"CSI\" team from Vegas. You've got the whole thing worked out. We'll be right back with more, we'll reintroduce our guests too, don't go away.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: It has become an extraordinary success story, in television. In fact, Mr. PETERSEN, just asked if it had been renewed, and was just informed, it has been renewed, thus of course Mr. Moones has completely lost his marbles. The guests are William PETERSEN, who plays Gil Grissom on \"CSI\", the Senior Forensic Officer, one of the show's producer's as well, Marg Helgenberger, one of the 50 most beautiful people in the &#8212; on the planet, according to \"People Magazine\", also known for her Emmy winning role on \"China Beach\", and she plays Catherine Willows, Jorja Fox plays Sara Sidle, the intensely focused member of the criminalist team, she was a murder victim in the cult hit \"Memento\", Gary Dourdan &#8212; Gary Dourdan is Warrick Brown on CSI, he was also credited with appearances on \"Swift Justices\" and \"New York Undercover\", and he is another member of the criminalist team, Elizabeth Devine, the story editor and technical consultant for \"CSI\", and a veteran criminalist herself.  \nAnd Dr. Henry Lee is the world renowned forensic expert, he's in Detroit, and he's the author of the book \"Cracking Cases, the Science of Solving Crimes.\"  \nOne of the things about the speed of it, do you think Bill , there's some danger when you have the answer on the DNA in two and a half minutes? And it might take two and a half months.\n\nPETERSEN: And in some cases, it can take up to six months because, for instance on our show, our lab work, we have everything we need.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nPETERSEN: You have all the equipment you could possibly have. There's labs across the country that don't have much of the stuff that we have. One of the problems in solving crimes today is, having the funding.\n\nKING: Well, do you think the public, Elizabeth, then wants answers right away? You see a drought &#8212; was isn't it over in two days?\n\nDEVINE: I think there is that possibility, but I also think that trained for most, which the people who do this are used to testimony, and they're used to telling &#8212; I'm used to telling jury's that, \"Hey that's television and this is real.\" But, we also have a job to do on the show, and that's to further the story and the only way to do that is not to wait six months for DNA, we're going to have to get it quickly, so that we can move on with the story. So, we do take that sheet , and it's just something that we do.\n\nKING: Jorja, what do you think drives the character? I know you've had a personal &#8212; a friend of yours lost someone very close to her, right, a mother?\n\nFOX: Yes, and I think all of us at some point have had a very personal experience with death. You know, as we were talking before, the stories that are true on the show, you always want to tell them with the most dignity that you can. You know it's a TV show, but, you know, please ...\n\nKING: So, the people you are playing, they don't make a lot of money.\n\nFOX: Pardon me?\n\nKING: They don't make a lot of money, these people.\n\nFOX: No, there ...\n\nKING: What do you think drives them?\n\nFOX: They're nuts, I think they're all typically very, very smart people, that are very good at something a lot of people can't even comprehend, and I think that, that kind of drive keeps them at what they do. I know there's a very high burn out rate actually with criminalists.\n\nKING: I would guess. What do you think Marg?\n\nHELGENBERGER: Why they like to do what they do. I think they have a knack for it, I think that they, I think most of them would tend to be ...\n\nKING: A little Sherlock Holmes-ish .\n\nHELGENBERGER: And meticulous, and they have an eye for detail, and are keen obervationists and I think ultimately, they all are detectives in their heart, they're detectives.\n\nPETERSEN: There's also a certain amount of heroism to what they do, I mean these ...\n\nKING: But, they don't get the headlines.\n\nPETERSEN: No, they don't. But, for them, to be able to &#8212; I remember being in Vegas when one of the \"CSI's\" had spent two weeks combing a car for fingerprints, and abandoned vehicle that had been stolen, and finally tape lifted a partial thumb print, and he was just &#8212; it was the most unbelievable, he was just lit up, from having finally been able to pull something that may or may not be able to get this thing done. And I mean &#8212; I think that they're, I think that they're heroes as well. I think that they also bring closure to an awful lot of people when there's seeming no closure available.\n\nKING: Well, if they get to tell the family member, here's what happened, here's why it happened.\n\nPETERSEN: Right.\n\nKING: And often solve it.\n\nPETERSEN: I think it's a good time, because it's the unsung hero, it's great to have Dr. Lee on the show, it's great to bring these criminalists out into the forefront.\n\nKING: Elizabeth, do the ever not get the bad guy on the show?\n\nDEVINE: Yes, one of the things that I try to strive for, is that we don't always figure it out, we don't always ...\n\nKING: As \"Law & Order\", you don't want to win them all.\n\nDEVINE: But, we win most of them, our audience wants us to solve the crimes, but we have a few that were unsolved. Gary did one, that basically going in, he knew he was not going to solve, and sometimes you have those, and it doesn't mean you work any less hard, but there are cases that you're not going to ever solve.\n\nPETERSEN: We had an episode early in the year that we all worked on this case, and it turned out at the end of the case, that it was an accident. And we had calls from everywhere going, \"What do you mean it was an accident. No, somebody had to do it, we want somebody to have done it.\"\n\nKING: Dr. Lee, is there the perfect crime?\n\nLEE: Well, in theory, shouldn't, and we unfortunately many times because they not found physical evidence, also no witnesses, like we often talk about solving crimes, just like a building a four legged table. You need a good crime scene. You need good physical evidence, detected through work on clue, found witnesses, the last one, little luck, we need luck. And if you don't have that, like the Jon Bonet Ramsey case, we don't have the for scenes that's why case still unsolved.\n\nKING: Might that case never be solved.\n\nLEE: Well, we still, people still working on it. If we have some new development in size or some witness come along, or maybe little lucky, a case may be solved. Of course, you know, people always talk about perfect crime, in reality, we work everyday. I can really appreciate a good comment about criminalists, because criminalists, forensic scientist, it's not a job, it's a profession. We have to devote ...\n\nKING: You never give up. You told me once, you were looking at cases from 20 years ago.\n\nLEE: Yes, as a matter of fact, this week as you know, you guys &#8212; you will cover that, Skakel case, happened 26 years ago.\n\nKING: And you testified in that case.\n\nLEE: Right.\n\nKING: And you said that the state prosecutors have no direct scientific evidence linking fingerprints or DNA to Skakel.\n\nLEE: Yes, but we have some indirect evidence, no direct evidence.\n\nKING: We'll take a break and be back with lots more about \"CSI\", don't go away.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: We're back with the cast of \"CSI\". You worked on the Menendez case?\n\nDEVINE: Very small part yes, I actually processed both defendants when they were suspected of trying to escape from their prelim, I had to look for metal shavings on them, and I looked at the evidence from the crime scene for possible reconstruction, which was not possible.\n\nKING: And it took all this time Marg, and they finally discovered in the Danielle van Dam case that she was suffocated. That was the means of death. It took all this time to find that out.\n\nHELGENBERGER: Right, I mean the little &#8212; I haven't been following the case closely, but I know the body been quite decomposed, it had decomposed quite a bit, and they said that was part of the reason of the hold up. Am I right Liz, about that?\n\nKING: How they, how they do it, is just amazing. Yes, you would think that everything's hopeless.\n\nPETERSEN: Yes, you can't, you would never be able to figure out anything from this.\n\nKING: But you can figure out things, I'm reading the book &#8212; bringing the book Michael Connelly, \"City of Bones.\" They find bones from a child, 30 years ago, and they can investigate off bones. They can find method of death off of bones.\n\nDEVINE: Yes, they can.\n\nPETERSEN: Yes, it's amazing isn't it? That's scary.\n\nLEE: Well, not every bone.\n\nKING: Dr. Lee, one wonders, why weren't you a normal doctor, Park Avenue, $700,000 a year, what are you need dead bodies?\n\nLEE: Well, I start my career as a police officer, a detective, as a matter of fact, as a captain in charge detective, 40 some years ago. Then, I become a scientist, and then of course, not have my mother want me to become a regular MD, make a lot of money, but let me tell you Larry &#8212; when I was in high school, I want to become a basketball player. When the coach looked at me 5 8&#8243; he says, you grow another two feet and come back to see me. Then I realized, I can't be a basketball player &#8212; but I'm really interesting in solving crime &#8212; I'm so happy I've become a forensic scientist.\n\nKING: Is it hard William dealing with scripts where people do terrible things to other people.\n\nPETERSEN: Yes.\n\nKING: Can we move around on this, I asked William, are you around, you see the worst.\n\nPETERSEN: Yes, and you can't believe, we're somewhat inured to all of that. I mean yes, you see it a little bit on the news, you see the newspaper, you hear about things, but when we do these case, and we &#8212; you know, this actually happened, they actually did this. It just makes you, you know, you just want are never sure what to wonder about humanity.\n\nKING: Doctor, you ever get used to coming upon a horrendous scene. You ever get used to that?\n\nLEE: Yes, everyday. Sometime we go to the crime scene, three, four, times a day. When the victim's family need help, because they usually turn to the police officer, detective, forensic scientist. We're their last hope.\n\nLike, I receive letter almost everyday, sometime 30/40 letters a day, phone calls &#8212; just other day a mother and call me and say her daughter disappear 40 some years ago, and she run out of all the resources, can I help out. Many time, they say their daughter been murdered, husband been murdered, so forensic scientist, you know sometime we hear a lot of sad story.\n\nOf course, when the case solved, when the family thank us, writing a letter, it's not really say, you can gain in financially, this a group of good people working day and night, helping society.\n\nKING: Are there any people Lee , who you run into who believe you are what you play?\n\nPETERSEN: I was in the grocery store the other day, and this gal was behind me in line, and she all of sudden recognized me and went, \"Grissom, it's you, it's Grissom.\", and I said, \"Not today, it's Saturday\", so I was off.\n\nDOURDAN: I was actually, we were shooting in Vegas, and I went up to Reno on one of my days off, an actual forensic detective came up to me and starting talking for about an hour.\n\nKING: Marg, happen to you yet?\n\nHELGENBERGER: Do I get confused with my character? Somewhat, but I have to &#8212; the other thing that &#8212; something happened to me the other day, in a airport, I was paying for a newspaper, and this gentleman said to me, \"I love your show, whoever writes it has got a sick mind, and you can tell them I said that.\" I'm going &#8212; one hand he loves it, but then he's like repulsed by it, I think part of the provocative nature of our show ...\n\nKING: Jorja, do you think people think it's sick?\n\nFOX: Sick?\n\nKING: Sick, weird.\n\nFOX: Yes, they probably do.\n\n(VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKING: Put it mildly, you have a weird job.\n\nFOX: So to speak, the black sheep.\n\nKING: We'll be back with our remaining moments with PETERSEN, Helgenberger, Fox, Dourdan, Devine, and LEE, sounds like a law firm. Don't go away.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nKING: Is it true that you get better equipment for the show, than real CSI people get?\n\nDEVINE: That's the truth, some crime labs ...\n\nKING: Did the company send it to you?\n\nDEVINE: Yes.\n\nKING: We see equipment, it's real equipment.\n\nDEVINE: Oh, yes. Everything we use is real. There are a lot of crime labs in CSI's that don't have access to it, but everything we use ...\n\nKING: That's not some set builder.\n\nDEVINE: Oh, no.\n\nDOURDAN: Sometimes it's not actually a prop.\n\nKING: If you tell me this is a macrobiotic transformer, it is.\n\nPETERSEN: I ask these guys around the country, and they'll go, \"I can't believe you have the mass spectrometer, you know, all that stuff.\"\n\nKING: Are you envious sometimes, Dr. Lee?\n\nLEE: Yes, I heard most of your comment. We're lucky, but most of time the crunch many piece of equipment you can't bring to the crime scene. Crime scene is one process, laboratory is another.\n\nKING: Laboratories are sexy and kinky though too, you know.\n\n\"(VIDEO CLIP)\"\n\nHELGENBERGER: Yes, sex does play a part.\n\nKING: As it does in our lives.\n\nDOURDAN: Plus it also does in murders a lot. You know ...\n\nHELGENBERGER: I've heard.\n\nKING: Is this show moving to Miami, or it's going to be a new show in Miami.\n\nDEVINE: This show is not moving, we're happily staying in Vegas, but there is another show, it's going to be in Miami.\n\nKING: Called \"CSI Miami\"?\n\nDEVINE: That's it.\n\nKING: Same producer, are you involved in that Bill ?\n\nPETERSEN: No, I'm not.\n\nKING: Can they take the name like that?\n\nPETERSEN: Well ...\n\nKING: Is it CBS?\n\nPETERSEN: Yes, CBS is doing it and some of our people are helping them do it, and it ...\n\nKING: So, it's not going to be a rival show.\n\nPETERSEN: I really don't &#8212; no &#8212; well, no, it's not.\n\nKING: Well you're \"CSI\", that's going to be \"CSI Miami\"?\n\nDEVINE: Yes.\n\nKING: Uh oh, this is going to be who wants to be a millionaire. We're going to have \"CSI Boston\", we're going to have \"CSI ...\n\nPETERSEN: Larry, it's always been the maxim in Hollywood, that that's work making is worth remaking. Anything that was good once, could be good twice.\n\nKING: Imitation is a serious form of flattery. Hope you all take Dr. Lee up in his offer, to come out there. Dr. Lee, thank you as always for joining us, and we thank Elizabeth, and Gary, and Georgia, and Marg, and William, the shoe is \"CSI\", it airs Thursday nights at 9:00, focuses on the team of forensic investigators working on the overnight shift of the Criminalistics Bureau in Los Vegas. Thanks very much for joining us on this special edition of LARRY KING LIVE for our whole crew, and everybody else here in Los Angeles, good night.  ",

There was a clip of Season 1 stuff with a voice over and lots of Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown) clips. Then they showed an interview of Jorja in one hotel room Paul and Robert in another, interspersed with clips form various episodes. There was mention of CSI's ratings success in the US and also for the UK's Channel 5, and a way too enthusiastic commentary from the presenters about the TMI cam for a breakfast show. Also blah blah Jorja Fox is aptly named, she was Maggie Doyle form ER.\n\nFollowing is a vague transcript of what they said, seeing as viewers only got the answers not the questions.\n\nTranscript\n\nJorja: I think everyone can sympathise with the show. There's something slightly off about it.\n\nPaul: Science can't be sexy.\n\nJorja: If people say the show is sexy that's a compliment. As there is no sex in it.\n\n\"Robert and Jorja talked about how all the actors they know want to be on the show as bodies.\"\n\n\"Paul and Jorja talked about the Bill Clinton wants to be on the show rumour. Paul debunked it, saying it was one comment that got out of control.\"\n\n\"There was this weird tribute montage where they got the actors to pretend that what was in front of them (they were all seated in front of tables) was a crime scene and comment appropriately in character.\"\n\nRobert: I would say something profound and multisyllabic.\n\n\"He also went on about how he'd slice (a non-existant body) and weigh the organs. Paul only said just don't touch the evidence.\"\n\n\"Jorja who was on her own, got really into making up a story about the objects in front of her and how imaginary clues would help her. Apparently some Colgate toothpaste was the key...\"\n\nAnd the CSI Season One special edition DVD will be released in the UK on July the first.",

        "content": "\nBryant Gumbel: Although it now may seem hard to believe, it was just two years ago the hit drama \"CSI\" barely made it on to the primetime schedule. The show has since become a hit with an unusual look at forensic investigators who solve crimes with science.\n\n[...]\n\nBryant Gumbel The stars of \"CSI\" are William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, Jorja Fox and Paul Guilfoyle. Good morning, everybody.\n\n(EVERYONE): Good morning, Bryant.\n\nBryant Gumbel Show of hands. Who thought this show was gonna be a hit? \"(Everyone but Jorja raises their hands.)\"\n\nBryant Gumbel Oh, come on!\n\nGary Dourdan It was the script. See, it was the material...\n\nMarg Helgenberger Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.\n\nBryant Gumbel Really?\n\nGary Dourdan A hit. We knew it was gonna be good, but I think that no one expected it.\n\nWilliam Petersen We didn't know it was gonna be, you know, 25, 28 million people watching.\n\nMarg Helgenberger We didn't think...\n\nPaul Guilfoyle \"(jokingly)\" And I think everything I do is gonna be a hit.\n\nBryant Gumbel Well, it's the one next to you \"(pointing to Jorja)\" that seems to be the good luck charm. I mean, regular on \"[[ER]],\" regular on \"[[The West Wing|West Wing]],\" regular on \"CSI.\" Sign you up in the making!\n\nJorja Fox Thank you. I didn't think the show was gonna be a hit. I think I was the only one that didn't. I had so much hope and faith and so much belief in \"CSI,\" but I really wasn't quite sure we were gonna stay on the air, but I was really happy...\n\nBryant Gumbel Why not?\n\nJorja Fox Well, I think it was a hard pitch at first for a lot of people. We were last to go at everything. Last to get picked up, like you said. And talking about death and science.\n\nWilliam Petersen Hair fibers are a major element of the thing, and fingerprints. It was a question of how well we were gonna be able to translate that to the screen.\n\nBryant Gumbel Well, usually audiences are turned off by things that are about death, that are bloody, that are macabre. What are they responding to in this case?\n\nPaul Guilfoyle Well, I think that the professionalism of the people. I think all drama is about people and interaction and I think they're really responding to all of us as a group. However we all cemented together is, I think, what people are responding to.\n\nWilliam Petersen We're all just working people, I mean, on the show and we operate in our jobs the way people go to work and operate in their jobs. We're very technical, very proficient, and I think it's interesting to watch the process. I think people enjoy watching the process of us put the science to the crime and solve the puzzle.\n\nBryant Gumbel But most of the time, people view people who are engaged with science as nerds. How are nerds turned into heroes?\n\nJorja Fox We're nerds.\n\nWilliam Petersen We're nerds. We just have better clothes.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle I think also that the plot, that crime is the antagonist of our show. So, you watch this group of dedicated professionals try to come up against or conflict with the crime itself. So I think that's what takes it away from the nerd thing is because of what we're dealing with.\n\nBryant Gumbel How much do you really know, any of you, about forensics?\n\nMarg Helgenberger We're getting to know more and more everyday. I mean, I knew very little when we began.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle And I don't leave my fingerprints on anything.\n\nMarg Helgenberger No, I do. I think about that all the time, whether or not I need to put on a pair of gloves or not.\n\nBryant Gumbel Come on!\n\nMarg Helgenberger I do!\n\nWilliam Petersen Every couple of months, we get better and better, at least, at being able to use the tools and being able to know what the tools are used for. I'm certain now if we came across a crime scene, we would at least know how to secure it.\n\nMarg Helgenberger Well, for instance, sometimes they'll do shots that don't include us, like tape-lifting prints from something and it would have been an added shot. And I saw this on an episode recently and my character was supposed to be doing it and I actually did it on the master. And then I saw the close-up and it was not my print. And it was so sloppy. And I felt like I wanna be doing my own inserts now because it was done...\n\nBryant Gumbel I'm gonna ask you, look, the show is fiction, but is the science [exact]? I mean, is that the one thing you never tamper with?\n\nWilliam Petersen The science is all real. The stuff we use is real, and the way we use it is all real.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle And I think some of the crimes are all real. They're based on real crimes. There's a lot of crime out there, unfortunately.\n\nMarg Helgenberger The process is sped up.\n\nBryant Gumbel You're never hurting for story lines.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle No.\n\nJorja Fox Unfortunately.\n\nBryant Gumbel Yeah, it is unfortunate. Talk to me about the collaborative effort of this. I mean, as I look at all of you, you've all had individual achievements and have been primary players in something else. Is it something where you have to check your ego at the door of a show like this?\n\nWilliam Petersen I think that's the wise thing to do with all work. Otherwise, it's a long day. It's a long day if you don't. And the great thing about this show, and I think in this case we're different than a lot of \"hit\" television shows in that our writers, our producers, our actors, our crew, even all the way to the network, we are very collaborative. It's not just one person's decision, as many hit television shows are. They come from one voice. We have a whole lot of people that work very hard all day long with each other to try and make this stuff work.\n\nBryant Gumbel Do you get involved in the plot lines, the story lines? You're making a face there, Jorja. Yeah?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah. We do.\n\nGary Dourdan Somewhat, yeah.\n\nJorja Fox &#8216;Cause we're dedicated. So, I don't know. Sometimes even for better for worse, I don't know if everybody always wants to hear from us, but they always act like they do. And they let us talk and they listen to us a lot, which is very kind of them.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle And acting is kind of the detailed work, almost like the way forensics is and in the course of the process of creating a television show, the acting is kind of the final touchstone of reality, and so I think that's where we all have our own unique experiences.\n\nBryant Gumbel In the final moments we've got left the show is now going to have a spin-off. How uncomfortable are all of you with that?\n\nWilliam Petersen As actors, I think anytime something else comes along to try and compare to your stuff, you get a little queasy about it.\n\nBryant Gumbel But you have the same people and they now have their attention split.\n\nWilliam Petersen Here's the deal. It's a very successful show and the network is ... and what \"Law and Order\" has done to television is a remarkable thing and I think that CBS is interested in some of that.\n\nPaul Guilfoyle That's a very provocative question, by the way, Bryant.\n\nBryant Gumbel We'll have to pursue it during the commercial. Guys, thanks very much and congratulations.\n\nWilliam Petersen Congratulations to you. Great job all these years.\n\nBryant Gumbel Thanks, Bill. The season finale of \"CSI\" airs tomorrow night at 9, of course, here on CBS. We're back in a moment, right after this. ",

Ding dong, you son of a bitch. Ding dong.\n\nCraig Kilborn That was good, right?\n\nJorja Fox It was great!\n\nCraig Kilborn That's exciting, seeing Buddy Hackett.\n\nJorja Fox It was, and I just met him outside.\n\nCraig Kilborn Did he talk your ear off? Did he tell you a dirty joke? What did he do?\n\nJorja Fox He told me that he's a police officer. And I got nervous.\n\nCraig Kilborn Oh really. Why would you get nervous? Meeting a cop?\n\nJorja Fox I don't know, I just, I don't meet a lot of police officers on the Craig Kilborn show. I didn't know if it was a set up, something's happening.\n\nCraig Kilborn There's nothing in your dressing room, is there?\n\nJorja Fox No. No, no.\n\nCraig Kilborn Okay, last time you were on here was one year ago.\n\nJorja Fox Yes! As a matter of fact.\n\nCraig Kilborn To the day, or something to that effect.\n\nJorja Fox Yes, it's maybe quite possible our anniversary.\n\nCraig Kilborn Of you being on the show.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah.\n\nCraig Kilborn That's exciting.\n\nJorja Fox Actually, I brought you a little something.\n\nCraig Kilborn You brought me a gift? You didn't have to do that.\n\nJorja Fox It's an anniversary present. And um, you know the 1-year anniversary I was just told is paper, so I brought you a paper.\n\nCraig Kilborn The L.A. Times.\n\nJorja Fox Because it's an L.A. story.\n\nCraig Kilborn This is the second one I got today. This is very nice.\n\nJorja Fox Do you read that?\n\nCraig Kilborn Yeah, I get it at my door. Um, your name - your name is Jorja Fox. Is in fact -\n\nJorja Fox My name.\n\nCraig Kilborn No, no, is your nickname though Foxy? Do people call you Foxy? Tell me they don't.\n\nJorja Fox No, they don't really. No, they do. I mean, usually when they do ... I mean, it's a nickname I had when I was a kid and -\n\nCraig Kilborn That's understandable.\n\nJorja Fox Because there was the whole thing about the Foxy Girl thing. And they were making t-shirts about Foxy Girl and stickers and bumper stickers and stuff like that.\n\nCraig Kilborn About what Foxy Girl? Just in general?\n\nJorja Fox Just Foxy Girl as a thing, you know. Like, you know, \"Have a good day.\" You know, it was just kind of a thing that happened. I don't know, maybe where I'm from.\n\nCraig Kilborn Where was this?\n\nJorja Fox A small coastal town in Florida. It was a small town.\n\nCraig Kilborn There was a whole thing about Foxy Girls there?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah.\n\nCraig Kilborn Okay.\n\nJorja Fox Does anybody remember that? The Foxy Girl thing with the t-shirts? [Audience cheers, applause] But I wasn't foxy at all.\n\nCraig Kilborn You were not foxy?\n\nJorja Fox No I wasn't. And my mother bought me a t-shirt for every day of the week. Because my last name was Fox and she thought that was really funny. And she would send me out into the world and I would get, you know, attacked and beaten.\n\nCraig Kilborn So, mom's funny ... or not funny.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah mom's very funny, she's very funny. And usually they call me Foxy at work when I bend over in a parking garage, you know, with latex gloves on, looking for blood spatter. Something like that. That's usually when I get, \"Hey, Foxy.\"\n\nCraig Kilborn Oh, you mean when you're taping CSI?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, at work.\n\nCraig Kilborn They call you Foxy?\n\nJorja Fox It's a teasing thing.\n\nCraig Kilborn What did they say about you in Stuff magazine?\n\nJorja Fox Oh, that's not me.\n\nCraig Kilborn Not on the cover.\n\nJorja Fox No, no, I mean in the magazine.\n\nCraig Kilborn This is, this is ... What do you think? Was it hard to say yes to do this or was it fun? Did you wanna do it or?\n\nJorja Fox You know, I was really surprised and shocked that I was invited to do it, actually. And I was interested in it. I went to work and I said to the guys, I was like, \"You know, what do you think about Stuff magazine? Do you think that would be something that would be good to do?\" And their lips started to move and they got these really strange looks on their faces and I was like, no, I don't know if I can really do this. They got too excited about it. I was like, \"Oh?\"\n\nCraig Kilborn Well, yours are different than the other photos because you are, like, wearing wigs and outfits.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah. It was, I had an amazing time and for someone like myself, because, like I said, I couldn't believe I was invited to do it. I was really happy to do it. I don't think somebody like me would normally get to do it.\n\nCraig Kilborn Oh, what do you mean someone like you? You're tall and lovely. What are you talking about?\n\nJorja Fox Well, thank you. I don't, you know, I just don't think of myself as like that kind, that girl that gets in magazines for men.\n\nCraig Kilborn Well, that's even more, the reason that's appealing. You know, you're just an innocent girl, and you're beautiful. Now look at this quote - I wanted to say you're innocent. If you can read this. Come in tight on this quote. It says something to the effect, \"I don't use handcuffs on the show, but I probably have some in my house.\" What is that?\n\nJorja Fox That was a question, you know, a specific question that was asked.\n\nCraig Kilborn Oh, they always trick and they ...\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, about household items. You know, which I think, you know, if people really went through a list of household items, of things they have in their house, I think most people, if they were being honest, would say that maybe they have a pair of handcuffs.\n\nCraig Kilborn Do you have a pair of handcuffs in your house?\n\nJorja Fox I probably, quite possibly do.\n\nCraig Kilborn That's the same answer. I don't. I do not. And I know I don't. There's no probably.\n\nJorja Fox Well, maybe you just don't know they're there. Because ...\n\nCraig Kilborn Did you purchase handcuffs in your past?\n\nJorja Fox Oh, maybe I was detained or maybe it was a birthday present.\n\nCraig Kilborn No wonder you got so scared when Buddy Hackett said he was a cop. That's the reason right there! You've been arrested before.\n\nJorja Fox It was, you know, for me it was like I was in Boogie Nights. And it was fantastic. It was like the one day of my life you know, and I felt like that. You know, I got into the Hollywood house and it was kind of very 70's, a beautiful house, and I could hear the music, like the Boogie Nights music and I had a great time.\n\nCraig Kilborn Okay. Wow. I'm gonna move off that just for a second.\n\nJorja Fox Okay.\n\nCraig Kilborn Actually no, I'm gonna move off it and not come back. [Jorja laughs] You were over in Europe recently, and was this for CSI promotion? I didn't know CSI was on over there, is it?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, it is, actually, which is interesting. It's playing in a lot of countries. I think, the last I heard we're playing in 41 countries -\n\nCraig Kilborn That's amazing.\n\nJorja Fox &8212; other than United States.\n\nCraig Kilborn How was uh, where'd you go in Europe?\n\nJorja Fox Oh, we started in New York for the show, and then Gary and Eric and I -\n\nCraig Kilborn Gary Dourdan.\n\nJorja Fox Gary Dourdan, Eric Szmanda, found ourselves in Paris together and then I went on to the south of France. Just got back.\n\nCraig Kilborn We have pictures of you now, and you slept a lot while you were in Europe?\n\nJorja Fox You know, Craig, I was very tired.\n\nCraig Kilborn Uh-huh.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah.\n\nCraig Kilborn So this is you. This is you in London ...\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, that's London.\n\nCraig Kilborn &#8212; sleeping. Beginning of the trip. No handcuffs in sight, thank goodness.\n\nJorja Fox There were no handcuffs!\n\nCraig Kilborn No handcuffs. And this is you, um, this time you have company in bed. I don't know if we can ...\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, that's Paris actually.\n\nCraig Kilborn That's Paris, and that's the dog, also called Paris. And then this is you in Paris.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, that's a different hotel in Paris.\n\nCraig Kilborn That's a man. That's Gary.\n\nJorja Fox It is Gary, isn't it?\n\nCraig Kilborn You don't even know who that is?\n\nJorja Fox No, yeah, it's Gary.\n\nCraig Kilborn And you guys are getting along swimmingly, obviously.\n\nJorja Fox We haven't talked. We haven't talked since Paris.\n\nCraig Kilborn We don't have much time left but are you still a vegetarian? How's that going?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah.

        "title": "Women Of ... Primetime Crime",
        "content": " \nIntro\n\nJorja Fox I never knew that I wasn't equal to everyone else out there.\n\n\"Who was your favorite female crime fighter?\"\n\nJorja Fox There were the pioneers out there, you know, like Angie Dickinson [...] I grew up on Charlie's Angels. Those women seemed, they were just incredible. They were so fierce. You know? 'Cause they were doing karate chops and solving crimes and had the guns and yet they were still young and smart.\n\n\"'Narrator** CSI's crime scene investigator is Jorja Fox.\n\nJorja Fox I think we feel like we get to play such smart, kinda cool women.\n\n\"What did you want to be when you grew up?\"\n\nJorja Fox I wanted to be an actor or a rock star. A marine biologist or president. [...] You know, my specialty, here at CSI ... laughter Is right here taps her head I always solve the cases. camera nods Most of the time. Don't tell any of the other actors that, though, they'd get upset. camera shakes it's head\n\n\"Who were your role models growing up?\"\n\nJorja Fox Reverend Dr. King, John Lennon. Later Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"'Narrator** The world of crime is dark and disturbing, but the women of Primetime Crime roll with the punches.\n\nJorja Fox It's an opportunity in a way to sort of go somewhere ... and see a really primal, vital, important part to life, you know? There's three sides to life: there's birth, there's life and there's death.\n\n\"Were you a tomboy or a girly-girl?\"\n\nJorja Fox My mom wanted a little girl so bad and she got a tomboy! laughter And she loves me!\n\n\"'Narrator** The women of Prime Time Crime recreate situations that police officers, detectives, forensic scientists and coroners face every day. For these leading ladies, taking on this challenge is an honor.\n\nJorja Fox I have so much respect for the people who do this job, you know and admiration. It's not a job I could do. [...] Hi, E! I'm Jorja Fox! I play Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. I'm a forensic scientist, I'm also a criminalist. This is Ali, my dog, like Muhammad Ali, the boxer. She's visiting with me here today, she comes with me a lot because I'm here a lot.\n\nNarrator CSI is set in Las Vegas, but the show is actually shot in Santa Clarita, CA.\n\nJorja Fox This is the set of CSI, these are our offices. I'm going to take you on a little tour. This is one of my favorite microscopes, it's a comparative microscope. So you can take, lets say, two different bullets, and put one here and one there and got back and forth and see if they look anything alike. You can put almost anything, anything that we might be wanting to compare goes through this microscope and it's kind of fun.\n\nJorja Fox If you look over to your right you'll see sort of a collection of all different sorts of weapons and guns. I've always been a pacifist, I mean it in my very heart, I'm a pacifist. But you know, I've got to admit that when I shot them a couple times, for different things I've done, that part's kinda fun.\n\n\"'Narrator** The CSI set is a long way from the small town in Florida where Jorja grew up.\n\nJorja Fox I was really goofy, I was wild. I was very fun most of the time. I had a really great, idyllic, childhood. Like always in water, always swimming. I was pretty fearless.\n\n\"'Narrator** Fearless enough to want to be an actor.\n\nJorja Fox I always wanted to be an actress. Like always, always, always wanted to be a- I either wanted to be an actress or a rock star. And I couldn't tell you why! And you think sometimes, you're like, 'Wow, I'm living my whole life on a decision that I made when I was five.'\n\n\"'Narrator** Even five year olds can make the right call.\n\nJorja Fox It's a great job, because you can be so many different people. I mean yeah, you always want to do the best job you can. I think we all are pretty much ... If you're trying to tell a story that's close to real life, then you want to pay it as much respect as you can. I've never met anybody in this business who's really not trying to tell a story with soul.\n\n\"'Narrator** Jorja Fox has been a woman of Primetime before, with recurring roles on ER and The West Wing. But it's CSI that really put her on the map.\n\nJorja Fox Honestly, what struck me was these six lines of this character description which this person had created. Here's this person, Sara Sidle, forensic scientist, criminalist, can drink people under the table kinda thing. Very smart, poor people skills, action oriented, adventure oriented. And I was like, 'Wow, I really have to go explore this!' Sara in a way, it's weird, she's kind of hero of mine. She's much gutsier than I am. She's very spontaneous. And she's a daredevil in that sense. If it's dark and dangerous, and luminous she's in it. Much more so than I am. I'm a little bit neurotic.\n\n\"'Narrator** But the actress is also motivated by the gadgets she gets to play with and the mysteries she gets to solve.\n\nJorja Fox I think that this show's kind of unique, just by the nature of what it's about. There's so much more technology, technologies that are breaking every day. Like we have tools on the show this year that people weren't using last year. So that's an edge that's very exciting. That you're moving with something that's breaking through while you're trying to tell a story. [...] This is the Layout Room. Whenever we get a case together and we've got a lot of different things from different places we'll put it all on this table and sit down and we'll hash it out. Like maybe we've got a shoestring from one thing, and we've got a hair from something else, and we've got a parking ticket from someplace. And in this room we'll sit down and fight out and really, often, find out exactly what happened [...] The story lines are challenging and insane every week and that's really exciting. Like you never know what's going to happen next. I certainly think that TV is smarter right now than it's been in a really long time, and I think that audiences are currently really enjoying it. Like people appreciate it if something's realistic, I think they appreciate something if it's truthful. [...] This may be my very favorite room. Because ... it's got a couch in it.\n\n\"'Narrator** But Jorja doesn't get a chance to lounge around very often.\n\nJorja Fox I love everybody more than I ever thought I could love people that I work with. But I'm never home, so I try to bring home with me. Keep my guitar in my trailer. My dog is my guru. My dog is obviously my best friend, that's the oldest statement in the world, but everyone knows it's true.\n\n\"Who is the one woman you admire most?\"\n\nJorja Fox Maya Angelo\n\n\"'Narrator** The women of Primetime Crime play it smart. They act fearless with their emotions in check. But just because these leading ladies act tough, doesn't mean they always are.\n\nJorja Fox I'm the wimp of the cast. I have the weakest stomach, I gross out the quickest. I don't want to see it the most. I'm a stickler for safety, I'm always worried about if everything's safe. I'm the nebbishy one.\n\n\"If you weren't doing this job, what would you be doing?\"\n\nJorja Fox I'd probably be playing a guitar in the background somewhere.\n\n\"'Narrator** Being a woman of Primetime Crime takes dedication and commitment. The hours are long, the locations are sometimes far from home, and personal time can suffer.\n\nJorja Fox I think it's hard on television. Everyone says that and it's a big stereotype, but I think it is. It's hard to juggle your work, your family, your friends and your self.\n\n\"'Narrator** Crime can be a grind, so each of these actors has found her own recipe for rest and rejuvenation.\n\nJorja Fox I have a little theater company with some friends. We put plays on. I like to go hiking, I surf a little bit.\n\n\"'Narrator** Success and hard work go together for these women, but sometimes the costs seem outweigh the rewards.\n\nJorja Fox I don't think there really is too many sacrifices or challenges. I go at this mostly with a very deep sense of gratitude. Here I am, lucky enough to get to do what I love to do. You can think to yourself 'Well this is very cool in storytelling.' It's one of the oldest forms of communication. If anything, I have just a tiny bit of guilt, that wow, this is what I do for a living.\n\n\"'Narrator** It's the era of strong women.\n\nJorja Fox I feel like I'm an empowered woman, and I feel a little naive in that sense, because I feel I've always been given the chance to be an empowered woman.\n\n Credits\n\nJorja Fox playing guitar\n\n\"'Narrator** Is that an original [song]?\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, it's an original. Just made it up, not quite sure what I'm playing. Jorja plays guitar as we fade to black ",

        "content": "\n93.7 BZZ is a top-40 station with all of today's new music.\n\nBubba: Has it hit you yet that you're on, like, the number one television show in the world?\n\nJorja Fox: No, absolutely not. I don't know if it'll ever really hit me. I don't really know, I mean it's kind of like fantastically overwhelming to think of.\n\nBubba: And it's not like you're a bit player in the show, that you like are taking credit for the whole show, you're actually are the show.\n\nJorja Fox: Well that's very nice of you to say that. There's like 140 of us that make the show.\n\nBubba: Well I know but you are- you're one of the key elements of that show.\n\nJorja Fox: I get to be there every week, you know. I always have something to do and I got to be there almost from the very, very beginning, which is something new for me. You know I was lucky enough I got to be on two other shows that did really well but I came in- They were already runaway, huge hits by the time I came on and this was the like big wildcard risk, who knew what was gonna happen kind of thing.\n\nDave: With the popularity of CSI, and your being so busy, that- I would guess that would be enough to make it so you didn't know even how popular the show was or anything. You're so busy doing...\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, you know, it's very ethereal, you know. It comes out in the newspaper and the ratings and, and everyone's very happy. And I've never really been a ratings watcher but we shoot up in this very small rural sort of area north of Los Angeles and you're sorta up there. It's almost like being on location every day. And you're just kinda doing what you do and you hear about it and you know, it's??? it's like, you know, being on a magic carpet ride. It's been just incredible.\n\nBubba: And you're great, by the way.\n\nJorja Fox: Well, thank you very much.\n\nBubba: Which- which helps.\n\nJorja Fox: It doesn't happen, you know? I mean this doesn't happen to anyone. The odds of this happening to anyone are like one in a billion.\n\nDave: Someone ??? who was it? &#8212; said you have better odds of getting colon cancer.\n\nBubba: What a horrible way to think of that.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, I know.\n\nDave: It is kind of a weird analogy.\n\nJorja Fox: There are better odds of anything almost happening to you probably than this.\n\nDave: So you film an hour and a half north of L.A.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\nDave: And you drive there every day?\n\nJorja Fox: Well we drive. It's about 45 minutes, it's about 90 minutes round trip. I mean we all usually drive there. Every once in awhile we'll stay up there if we've got a big grind or sometimes you're just beat and you know. I stayed up there just last week.\n\nBubba: Why ??? why do you tape all the way up there?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, originally, you know, there wasn't a lot of money for the show, and we really wanted to focus most of it.\n\nBubba: Well, that's changed!\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. Maybe, I don't know. That's focused a lot on the special effects. They really wanted the effects to be good. And also, it's a good master of Vegas. Like up there it's high desert country, and at least the exterior area. If you can't do the city Vegas, which we come down, we shoot in downtown L.A. for that, sometimes or we go to Vegas to get that. But we can do the deserts, and we can do the mountains and a lot of stuff.\n\nDave: They always remind me of old Barnaby Jones.\n\nJorja Fox: Nice, thanks, excellent!\n\nDave: I think it's cool. I love that area.\n\nBubba: I remember the first time I watched CSI. A friend of mine said, \"You've gotta watch this show.\" We work weird hours and we don't get a chance to watch it.\n\nJorja Fox: You guys are morning guys, right? Yeah, so that's late for you.\n\nBubba: But I remember I sat down and watched it.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you.\n\nBubba: And I was hooked. Immediately. It's one of those shows that if anybody listening knows about it, hears about it, the popularity of it, all you have to do is watch it once. And the one show that stands out in my mind is the show with the uh- the little people. You remember that show?\n\nJorja Fox: That was last year, yeah.\n\nBubba: It was the little people convention. How much research went into every single show because-\n\nJorja Fox: Phenomenal amounts done on every show.\n\nBubba: There are things in that I never thought about. It was great.\n\nJorja Fox: It was cool. It was sort of the largest assembly of little people actors since Over the Rainbow and before that The Wizard of Oz. So it was really fun and you know a lot of ??? you know a ton of those actors knew each other and it was really cool to work with all those guys. They were great people.\n\nDave: The opening song is that the thing that uh you can hear from anywhere in the house, wherever you are, and you hear that, the opening from The Who, and you know, boom!, it's begun.\n\nJorja Fox: That's still, you know, my favorite part of the show. Every week is the song with the credits.\n\nDave: Me too! Same thing! Because the way it's edited, with the ??? they do the opening of the show with whatever the scene is or whatever.\n\nJorja Fox: The teaser.\n\nDave: And then, boom!, man, right into that. And that song was just so perfect for that.\n\nJorja Fox: So compelling. It was unbelievable that we were able to get that song. And it was Billy's idea. Billy Peterson was like, \"No, this song. This song.\"\n\nDave: No way!\n\nJorja Fox: And everybody's like, \"We don't have the money for this. No way we're gonna get this song.\" And then they talked to Pete Townsend and it happened and it was a coup. I mean, it was really an amazing moment to get that song.\n\nBubba: Have you ever had a scene where there's a body and obviously it's either an actor.\n\nJorja Fox: I have a lot of scenes where there's a body.\n\nBubba: I know. But my point is, it was so realistic looking, so gross looking, that you almost got sick?\n\nJorja Fox: It happens all the time to me. It still happens. I'm going into four years of this and that still happens to me on a regular basis.\n\nBubba: And I mean even though you know it's either an actor with all kinds of makeup on or a dummy.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, a live, a real live actor.\n\nBubba: And you're like gaaak?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, it's pretty gnarly. The special effects guys...\n\nBubba: They're amazing.\n\nJorja Fox: I think we have the best special effects guys in the business. They're really fantastic between the makeup and the effects that we do and ...\n\nBubba: I think the coolest thing is like when they'll show like the scene of someone getting shot but then the bullet hits the body and then they follow the bullet into the body and threw the heart and into the lung.\n\nJorja Fox: Sick and crazy.\n\nBubba: And you're like, ugh!\n\nDave: And you'll sit here and tell us with a straight face that there's nothing erotic about that. \\laughter all around\\ We're talking to Jorja Fox.\n\nJorja Fox: Wait, I'm sorry, is that about the dead body or about the bullet that, uh ???\n\nBubba: Jorja, I don't work with him.\n\nDave: The new season of CSI starts tonight, 8 PM. Thank you, Jorja Fox.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you guys so much, and take it easy.",

        "content": "\nCrash and Burn\n\nJorja Fox You know, Sara Sidle had a very dark year in season 3; she had a tough one, she really had a tough one. It really started, uh, I would say, in January, about midway through the season. Ah, the first thing that happens is, is, a very good friend of hers betrays her very personally. And the next time we see Sara, her boyfriend, it turns out, has a girlfriend and he also betrays her.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox And I think for her, you know, the type of person that she is and what she does for a living, she's so sure that she knows the truth about everyone, and to find out that two people she was very very close to were, were lying to her all along is a pretty hard thing for her to digest. You know, just above and beyond the fact that these relationships both go sour but then &8216;wow, that somebody, she was fooled, she was tricked' by people she was close to. Then, ah, we see her again in another episode and the lab blows up and she, she walks away from the explosion, her and Greg Sanders get blown up together, and that was a very hard thing, I think for her, you know, personally, and, and the episode ends with-\n\nPlay With Fire\n\nJorja Fox -- a pretty certain refusal from Grissom that anything will ever happen between the two of them, so, that was, that season 3 for Sara was \"hard\".\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox [Director] Danny [Cannon] is fast, he's like the lightning bolt director, and everybody loves, you know, just starting out with him they know that they're gonna get, they're gonna have a shorter day with him and that things are going to move very quickly and people really like that, you know, it's, it's, when you're on show 12 and you've been working for five months the idea of having a short day is really good.

It's much simpler than surfing\n\nInterviewer: I think there's a little bit more to do than that.\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, I just- we've been so blessed, so lucky and I hope we keep doing it for a long time and don't take any single day for granted.\n\nInterviewer: Are you squemish at all when you're doing any of these scenes?\n\nJorja Fox: Mmmhmm. Yeah, continuiously squeamish. Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: Really? Why is that?\n\nJorja Fox: Well. The show's kind of violent. It's kind of dark, and horrible things happen to people and we recreate those scenes for the crime scenes. Then we go to the morgue and then we go to the lab and we chop up pieces of their liver or their heart.\n\nInterviewer: Are you looking at real life sort of ... crime scene situations, trying to figure them out? Now that you've been doing this for a long time.\n\nJorja Fox: No. No, not at all.\n\nInterviewer: You just let the- this is just work.\n\nJorja Fox: No. I watch Disney, I watch like, cartoons for kids.

You just put 'em on all the products in your bathroom, --\n\nEllen Really?\n\nJorja -- and they're French then.\n\nEllen Lotion vegetale.\n\nJorja Yeah. And it'll help, you know, with the French thing.\n\nEllen What is &#8216;vegetale'?\n\nJorja Umm...\n\nEllen You don't know.\n\nJorja I don't really speak French, no, but I, uh\n\nEllen That's a clever thing, to put stickers on things so you know what it is. I don't, it's not, the problem is the accent really. It's, it's I --\n\nJorja Ah.\n\nEllen -- That's my problem.\n\nJorja Right.\n\nEllen It's not so much that I can't read --\n\nJorja Oh, the &#8216;rrrrrrrrrr.'

Y'know I've been wanting to tell you, and I, and I, we've crossed paths several times --\n\nEllen Mmm-hmm.\n\nJorja -- not for a while, and when I first moved to Los Angeles like 8 or 9 years ago - well maybe we won't get into that exactly how long ago - but one of the first things that I ever did, and I know that you won't remember this, was I was invited to Ellen DeGeneres' birthday party. And of course we didn't know each other and you --\n\nEllen No. How were you invited?\n\nJorja Y'know, I knew the uh, y'know, the coat check guy --\n\nEllen Oh.\n\nJorja -- really well --\n\nEllen Ah.\n\nJorja -- yeah, at the Chateau Marmonde, from New York.\n\nEllen Slip him a twenty?\n\nJorja Yeah, yeah, y'know because I bartended there and --\n\nEllen Uh-huh.\n\nJorja -- Yeah. No, mutual friends invited and it was like, it was so huge and I was like fresh from New York City, very excited, here I was in Hollywood, and the first place that I, that I was invited to go to was your party and you were actually very nice to me, I mean until that thing happened in the parking lot...\n\nEllen Uh-huh.\n\nJorja And uh, and uh, I haven't been to any of your birthday parties since, but --\n\nEllen Uh-huh.\n\nJorja -- but it was great, and I remember it, y'know I cherish that.\n\nEllen Yeah, I uh, that was a great party wasn't it?\n\nJorja Yeah, Chateau Marmonde, do you, yeah...\n\nEllen Yes, oh I remember that party.\n\nJorja Like swanky soiree.\n\nEllen Yeah. You have one of these parties that you try to top every year and you just know, it was one of those magical nights that it was so, so cool and people showed up that, I had no idea who a lot of the people were.\n\nJorja Yeah, yeah.\n\nEllen People like you.\n\nJorja Yeah.\n\nEllen But it was fun.\n\nJorja Right.\n\nEllen And what did you bring me? What kind of gift?\n\nJorja A gift? Um, y'know I um, I do not --\n\nEllen Perhaps that's why you --\n\nJorja -- it really wasn't that kind of party I don't think.\n\nEllen No, well they say it's not kind but you still bring a gift.\n\nJorja I remember, I distinctly remember, yeah, &#8216;no gifts', no gifts.\n\nEllen Well I --\n\nJorja In capital letters but I'm making up for it.\n\nEllen Well when people say that you still have to bring a gift. That's, that's why you've not been invited back.\n\nJorja I, I don't think you're uh... Right. You didn't get as much for those as, as you did for the watch, but maybe, y'know --\n\nEllen And I appreciate this.\n\nJorja -- something will come of that.\n\nEllen And I'll look through 'em and maybe say some things later. Um, all right, so uh, so now you've been here for how long? Nine years?\n\nJorja Yeah, I think almost nine years.\n\nEllen And, and where are you living, what area?\n\nJorja Ah, y'know I'm living in Hollywood, I just got a new place --\n\nEllen Mmm-hmm.\n\nJorja -- new house, I'm sleeping on the kitchen, on an air mattress with my dog, and uh --\n\nEllen That's not a good house.\n\nJorja Well, it's, it's a big empty house. Y'know it's funny, I got my dog, I went out --\n\nEllen But why, why are you in the kitchen though?\n\nJorja They've been doing some work in the other, in the rest of the house, in the bedrooms and stuff.\n\nEllen On all the rest of the house? The only thing you're not doing work on is the kitchen?\n\nJorja Yeah, yeah kind of, yeah. Yeah, and I was on friend's couches for a couple of weeks, and that was really fun, and everybody was really gracious, and --\n\nEllen Uh-huh.\n\nJorja -- then I kinda ran out of places to stay so --\n\nEllen Right.\n\nJorja -- now I'm in the kitchen.\n\nEllen Okay, so and, and when is the work going to be done?\n\nJorja I think, y'know they keep saying y'know, &#8216;any day' --\n\nEllen Oh.\n\nJorja -- y'know, 'tomorrow, tomorrow'...\n\nEllen Oh... whatever they say, don't believe 'em.\n\nJorja Yeah.\n\nEllen That's uh, that's, that's, oh, work is...\n\nJorja You know of any good hotels, actually? In the L.A. area?\n\nEllen Sure - Chateau Marmonde.\n\nJorja \"(laughs)\"\n\nEllen That's a good hotel.

Death so happens in the nighttime, normally.\n\nGeorge Eads: Yeah.\n\nStar: So, any good gambling stories?\n\nJorja: turns to George Well...\n\nGeorge: Um, I won $6,000 dollars once on a video poker machine.\n\nStar: You did?\n\nJorja: I shopped well on that money.\n\nStar: You have to share it.\n\nJorja: nodding Actually...\n\nGeorge: Well video poker, it's kind of a slower game, and I was playing with my dad, and we were really just catching up and I go gesturing, look of mock surprise, 'Oh, Dad, I think I won a lot of money'.\n\nStar: Actually you're wrong, you won 600, didn't you George.\n\nGeorge: No I won 6,000 and my dad had so much anxiety about gambling, it was every time you put the money in pretending to wipe sweat from his face it's just 'Oh', I thought he was going to like pass out. So I just counted the money.\n\nStar: pushing it I heard somewhere it was just 600 dollars,\n\nGeorge: Well actually it was-\n\nStar: Because 6,000 generates a lot more taxes.\n\nGeorge: Oh I paid all the taxes on it. smirks at the crowd\n\nStar: This is why lawyers can't \"stand\" detectives 'cause they don't stiff, they don't get it off.

Does that, do you find that amazing?\n\nJorja: Thank you. gesturing I'm instantly blown away, completely blown away. But weekly I mean it's always a surprise, every week when it happens, it's always a surprise because you know, you never ever think it's going to happen again, and then...\n\nStar: Again.\n\nJorja: Sometimes it happens again.\n\nStar: And again and again and again...\n\nMeredith Viera: You learn a lot of stuff, don't you.\n\nJorja: Not much.\n\nMeredith: You don't learn anything?\n\nJorja: No, I don't.\n\nGeorge: Well, I think, I think when, a lot of times it can be a little intimidating so you just, like 'aminonapathenetrisulphonic acid'. general laughter I woke up in my sleep the night before saying that one. more laughter\n\nGeorge: But if you don't know what it, uh, what it means you kind of define it, phonetically pronounce it, and uh, there's a tech there to show you how it's applied.\n\nJorja: I just write it on my hand.\n\nMeredith: And then you fake it.\n\nGeorge: And then we fake it real good.\n\nJorja: I write it on my hand. pushes her cap back a bit, looks down at her hand as if reading something written there\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck: Well we were here for a week and we've had so much fun already I can't even imagine what it's like to have this city for your backdrop all the time. There's got to be some crazy things that happen.\n\nGeorge: Well as an actor if you have to work, uh, we kind of keep tabs on each other. Like making a phone gesture 'Are you in bed? Get in bed'.\n\nJorja: It can be a little distracting. I don't know if that's been your experience, but you know when you're working, or if-\n\nMeredith: It's very distracting. So much fun stuff to do.\n\nJorja: It's a lot of fun. We go home very tired.\n\nElisabeth: And we're losing all of our money.\n\nJorja: Yeah. Well I play the nickel slots.\n\nMeredith: Oh really, well so does- laughter, Barbara Walters reaches over, shakes Jorja Fox' hand\n\nBarbara Walters: ...I have it all worked out. You and I play the nickel slots-\n\nJorja: Yeah.\n\nWalters: I wouldn't mind having a romance with you, you're a great kid.\n\nMeredith: Hey!\n\nGeorge Eads - on the opposite side of Jorja from Barbara - gets up slowly and pretends to start to go over to hug Barbara\n\nMeredith: Barbara, Barbara, calm yourself!\n\nGeorge Eads sits back down, starts to crawl into Jorja's lap while reaching out his hand to Barbara; Jorja pushes him back\n\nJorja: Fend him off. I'm going to fight him off. George Eads sits back down\n\nBarbara: Remember that your father is benefitting. Is it true that a lot of what you- turns to Meredith I thought that was very nice of you.\n\nMeredith: Yeah, very polite.\n\nBarbara: Is it true that you based a lot of your character on your father who's a district attorney, in Texas?\n\nGeorge: Yeah, my, I think my dad carried a lot of angst as a D.A. for 28 years. Um, it was almost like Clint Eastwood at work and then he would come home-\n\nBarbara: Was it tough with your father?\n\nGeorge: -and he's... It really got to him after a while, the, it's the wake of sorrow that's left after you lose someone that I think was the hardest thing for him to handle, and, and getting to play a character that can kind of have those emotions and passions for the victims, that kind of can't speak for themselves any more, and uh, I was just so inspired by his passion for his work, it's kind of fun to play dad a little bit. Hi, Dad.\n\nJoy Behar: My dad was actually a medical examiner, a family doc, so I can relate to a lot of the scenes, in your show. But there's a lot of gore - how do you guys handle that?\n\nJorja: I'm nauseous most of the time.\n\nJoy: You are nauseous?\n\nGeorge: Try not to eat.\n\nJorja: No, we don't eat much.\n\nGeorge: Before you go to work.\n\nJorja: At work.\n\nGeorge: No, it, that, sometimes, when I don't think it can get any grosser...\n\nStar: And then it does.\n\nGeorge: We had an episode that we just shot last week where um, laughs, someone had been-\n\nJorja: That's funny. laughs You're laughing.\n\nGeorge: I don't know why it's funny.\n\nJorja: It's funny because-\n\nGeorge: Because it's make-believe.\n\nJorja: -it's so disgusting.\n\nGeorge: -where an inmate tried to escape from prison by attaching themselves to the bottom of a bus, unsuccessfully. chorus of disgust noise\n\nStar: I always hate the ones you do where there're floaters, where the people come out of the water,\n\nJorja: Yeah.\n\nStar: You all like the floating scenes.\n\nMeredith: I did that once, where I didn't have a Metro card.\n\nGeorge: No?\n\nMeredith: gesturing Sometimes you just have to get some place, you know?\n\nElisabeth: I would, I would just have a tough time, y'know, leaving and going to sleep at night, dealing with the forensic science and all the darkness and gruesome-\n\nJorja: Nightmares.\n\nElisabeth: Until, nightmares.\n\nJorja: If I read the scripts before I go to bed I still get nightmares.\n\nElisabeth: I wouldn't be able to do it.\n\nJorja: Drink a lot of beers.\n\nGeorge: Yeah, there's some - I don't really get nightmares that are full on beginning, middle, and end stories that I can remember, but, there are flashes in my mind that wake me up sometimes but...\n\nBarbara: Do you think that's what one of the reasons the show is so popular is because of the gore? she points at George Are you going to tear- George starts to gesture at Jorja with his thumb, Meredith interrupts\n\nMeredith: Why does everybody keep bringing Al Gore into this? (laughter) Leave him alone, he lost. Leave him alone. The gore, the gore, the gore. (more laughter)\n\nJorja: He didn't lose, he-\n\nBarbara: What a nice compliment you just got from your partner, that's very sweet.\n\nJorja: Yes, thank you. Very kind.\n\nStar: Well I still say-\n\nJorja: He's my man.\n\nStar: -you play one of the best casts on television, I love watching you all, I have since the beginning and we big fans of the show, so-\n\nJorja: Thank you so much.\n\nStar: Thank you very much, thank you for bringing us to Vegas also.

        "content": "\nIt's kind of a funny thing about our show, 'cause I say that the audience is almost split down the middle, where about 50% of the audience really just wants to, they want the stories. They don't wanna get into the characters personal lives all that much. And then the whole other 50% of the audience wants always to know more about the characters. It's a unique conundrum for the writers, and I think they handle it very gracefully and ... they're always disappointing someone and they're always making someone happy. So they tend to follow their hearts a lot and just write what they feel, and, ah.\n\nI think this season we're going to go back, at least in the beginning of the season, to a lot of the early CSIs. Should be very story driven, and ah, which will be fun! Cause it was kind of an emotional year. Character-wise, you know. All the characters, almost everybody on the show went through something deeply personal and sort of painful.\n\nSo we'll wipe that out for a while, and probably do a lot of blowing things up and exciting chase scenes. And then get back again to the heart of the matter.\n\nNew direction...\n\nThe episode that I did, Committed, with Richard Lewis, was one of the greatest working moments of my life. We had a lot of fun and it was dangerous. It felt kind of intense. And I'm really excited to see, you know, where Sara might go this year. She's been so heavy for just a long time. There've been all these different things sort of working against her, and I have a feeling that the hot air balloon that she's been looking for is gonna sail this season. And, uh, she'll lighten up a little bit and maybe we'll return to some of those story-lines from time to time.\n\nJorja on SARA...\n\nI think she's almost, she's a little social misfit, really. You know, I think her social skills are some of the weakest skills that she has. It's awesome to play her, cause she's so smart, she's so good at her job. But when it comes to matters of the heart, or matters of friends or personally life, she's completely awkward and uneducated. But sensitive to it. You know, I think she's an emotional personal, and vulnerable, she's just never quite comfortable in those areas of her life.\n\n\"'A romance with Grissom?\"'\n\nWell I would definitely say \"Never say never.\" You know, I think the ball is in Grissom's court at the moment. I think that Sara's made a decision that she's gonna move on. She chased him for about two seasons, I think, a year and a half, two seasons. I think there's definitely a possibility that something might happen between the two of them before it's all over. But who knows how long it's going to be before it's all over? Just keep my fingers crossed that it'll be a while before it's over laughter. I don't know.\n\nOther projects...\n\nI produced this play in Los Angeles last year, and we just found out that it's gonna go to London in March of 2006. I'm very excited about that. I guess there'll be a trip abroad in my future.\n\nFor the joy of it...\n\nI do play guitar. I don't think I've ever played guitar well. But I've played guitar for a long time and I consistently play bad guitar. So I love it, yeah. And that's something that's always just been, sort of something to do for myself. I think it's really nice to have things that you do, which is similar to the theater company that I'm involved with, that it's really just for the joy of it and the adventure of it. Not really looking for any long term results or anything like that. It's good for anybody to have that thing going on. So yeah, so I do. We jam, we play.  ",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox I've been a vegetarian since I was nineteen. I come from like a French-Canadian family who ate meat and potatoes every day, three times a day for my entire youth, and I used to tease the heck out of my friends that were vegetarians, and I had a lot of 'em, and then when I became a vegetarian I just decided that I was going to try and learn as much I could so that when people teased me, maybe I'd have a couple of things to say. So PETA very quickly in New York City was an organization that I'd heard about, and I read about, and I started going to rallies, and demonstrations, and protests. Um, and I've been a huge supporter and fan of ever since, y'know, you guys rock and I think, you know, you, you do it in such a sort of an alternatively exciting, and fresh, and, um, confrontational way, and that's awesome.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox Hi, I'm Jorja Fox, I'm an actor, I'm a guitar player, I'm a surfer, uh, I'm a sister and a daughter, and I am a vegetarian.\n\nVegTV How long have you been involved with PETA?\n\nJorja Fox Well I've been a fan and supporter and rally-er from many many years, since I've been a vegetarian, so that's like forty years ago, you know, fifty.\n\nVegTV You haven't been a vegetarian for forty years, you haven't been on this planet for forty years. \"(Jorja laughs)\" How long have you been a vegetarian?\n\nJorja Fox Uh, you're gonna laugh, um, I'd say six- eighteen years, yeah.\n\nVegTV Most of your life.\n\nJorja Fox Yeah, yeah, since I was a teenager or so, there you go.\n\nVegTV What was the epiphany, what, what was it made you become vegetarian?\n\nJorja Fox Y'know, it was a meatball sandwich in Brooklyn one afternoon and I don't know what it was about it, but y'know I, those little moments, I had friends, and people I'd gone out with who were vegetarians and bands that I liked that were vegetarian, Morrisey's here tonight, I'm very excited to see them, and uh, and it just kinda all came together over a meatball hero in Brooklyn one day and that was that. And then I was really that person who would tease those people quite a bit, you know, the type of person that'd be &#8216;oh, y'know, well vegetables are alive too and you're killing vegetables if you eat them', and so I decided to get as educated as I could, cause I, I, you know, didn't want to get the same teasing back at me after I was a vegetarian, so I found PETA very quickly.\n\nVegTV Would you do one of those ads for PETA, would you take off your clothes?\n\nJorja Fox Go naked? Maybe. I might, yeah. I haven't been naked yet actually, so I might. I wouldn't look good enough, but I'll do it, yeah. \"(laughs)\"\n\nVegTV Anything new, anything upcoming for you?\n\nJorja Fox Um, we got a bunch of CSI coming out, and it's all very horrible, and there's lots of dead people, and we're excited. I have a little play I'm producing that's going to London in March 2006.\n\nVegTV What's the play about?\n\nJorja Fox Uh, it's the story, it's actually based on a true story of a young woman from a small town in England that comes to America in the late sixties to follow her dreams, so it's very, yeah, takes advantage of New York City in the early seventies; it's a good story, lotta heart.\n\nVegTV Anywhere we can follow that? Is it on the Internet?\n\nJorja Fox Uh, yeah, dearbernard.com, it's on the Internet, it's a full length original musical, so we'll see. We put it up in L.A. last year, and we're taking, slowly getting to London in March.  ",

Every Friday, we're going to take you behind the scenes to show you how they make it happen. In last night's episode, called \"Secrets and Flies\", star Jorja Fox came face to face with an actor's big challenge: working with a baby. Or did she?\n\nJorja Fox: The camera comes in, you find a woman who's obviously deceased, you don't know what's happened, there's a pool of blood, and the only other sound in the house is of a baby crying. Well, first thing I wanted to say for the record, Moms and Dads, at home, don't worry, no babies were traumatized in the making of \"Secrets and Flies\" that aired last night. \"(Jorja brushes her hair back, grins)\" It's amazing how we can do these things, we'll have a baby in a room by his self, and then the baby will leave the room and the actress will come in and do her part of the scene which really was fairly stagnant, as some of you might remember. So yeah, there's tricks of the trade and so forth when you're working with a baby. And often the Moms and Dads of those babies become pivotal in helping to, ah, create the mood for the baby that we're looking for.\n\nJorja Fox: It was, uh, a really fun scene we did in that show, yes, there was this woman representing this sort of baby bank, and how these babies find their way to mothers, and, ah, what's sort of, ah, different for me in that respect is I'm, I'm the one who sort of got to keep my calm and watch all this happen while Marg Helgenberger, who of course plays Catherine Willows gets a little hot under the collar. And she does have a temper, we've seen that from time to time, but we rarely see her interacting, um, with anybody other than suspects that she's almost positive are guilty of actually committing a crime. \n\nJorja Fox: It was fun, it was really great to just sort of back Marg's character up like that, and try and be the stoic one, you know, and get the information, and remain less emotional, cause that's not really Sara's forté.\n\n:Julie Chen: Now next week is \"CSI Week\" here on The Early Show; every day we're going to have something special, including visits to the sets of \"CSI: Miami\", \"CSI: New York\" and the original \"CSI:\". Plus we're going to get to hang out with the stars, so stay tuned for that.",

        "content": "Simon Mayo has a talk show called \"*star studded\" on the BBC radio 5 for news, sport and in-depth interviews. On May 18th, he talked with Jorja Fox about ER, The West Wing, CSI and Dear Bernard.\n\nSimon Mayo: Jorja Fox has sidled in stage left. How are you doing?\n\nJorja Fox: I'm doing great Simon thank you so much for having me.\n\nSimon Mayo: Well thank you for coming on. We will talk about this play that you are casting in the UK and a few TV programs you've been involved with along the way. Just ahead of the trouble, actually, I like this, this is going to be the tone of a lot of them, I think this is a breathless e-mail.\n\nJorja Fox: Uh oh.\n\nSimon Mayo: From Esther, 'Congratulations on CSI. It's terrific as have been all your other series. Can you tell us your favorite memory of each?'\n\nJorja Fox: It's a very tough question. Thank you, Esther. For [[ER]], I think it would be, Tony Edwards, Anthony Edwards, directed his first show and I was lucky enough to be in the episode. He did all of act two of the show in one long steady cam shot. \n\nSimon Mayo: Wow.\n\nJorja Fox: Which was amazing and brilliant. We went through about ten different rooms in the hospital. From the trauma rooms, back to the admit station, to the hallways.\n\nSimon Mayo: The tension getting towards the end of that shot must have been extraordinary.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.t was &#8212;\n\nSimon Mayo: Don't mess up now!\n\nJorja Fox: &#8212; the most stressful day of my life, to be at the end of that scene you know? And If everybody else did it well, the pressure is on you to get through it. [[The West Wing]], there is several, but the one I think I'll call out today, Martin Sheen. Obviously who played the president, very brilliantly on the West Wing. For at least the first couple of seasons on the show, when ever he would go to set or come back from set in the van he would request the actual presidential theme music that we use in the States when the President, you know, our official President, makes entrances and exits.\n\nSimon Mayo: Right.\n\nJorja Fox: So for him to be getting in and out of the van with that theme music playing \n\nSimon Mayo: He was joking.\n\nJorja Fox: I think it was for fun, but I think also it helped really get him in and out of character.\n\nSimon Mayo: Hail the conquering hero?\n\nJorja Fox: Hail, yes, \"Hail to the Chief\".\n\nSimon Mayo: Hail to the chief, right.\n\nJorja Fox: And he would wave. He would have the window open and he would wave at folks on the Lot, or whoever might be passing by while he drove by in this car. And I hope, and I think, that my favorite [[CSI]] memory is still yet to come.\n\nSimon Mayo: Very good answer. \n\nJorja Fox: Thanks.\n\nSimon Mayo: On the subject of The West Wing, which of course just finished, in the States, even though it hasn't finished here, yet. Martin Sheen did have something extraordinary about him didn't he? And I wonder if one of the reasons, not just the fact the he is a great actor, but it started of as sort of an alternative Clinton White House. \n\nJorja Fox: Yes.\n\nSimon Mayo: And then very much, certainly in Europe, and I imagine in democratic bit of America, became a sort of 'if only' presidency.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\nSimon Mayo: In a parallel universe.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, precisely. I think so and I was fortunate enough, I was there for season one, of the West Wing, which is the only season where it was sort of a Clinton-esque. White House on the show that was mirroring a Clinton presidency. So in many respects they were, they were golden years. And we were there through a Presidential election and I got to meet Chelsea Clinton. I was playing the secret service agent to the president's daughter and so there was a comradely there and an invitation there that I felt was very extraordinary and special. Someone like myself would never have been a part of a social circle similar to that, had I not been able to be a part of that show.\n\nSimon Mayo: I would encourage people to look at your extraordinary website. But just looking at some of the various bits and pieces are great fun including websites and areas that you would like people to go off and have a look at.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you.\n\nSimon Mayo: Would I be correct in saying that sort of politically you are with the West Wing? There is a link to Michael Moore for example, so you are very much of the &#8212;\n\nJorja Fox: Yes, you might put me ...\n\nSimon Mayo: ... in the anti-Bush camp.\n\nJorja Fox: Yes, you might put me in the category of liberal-leftist-freak. Yeah, that would probably be appropriate.\n\nSimon Mayo: Okay, I was just checking. Now before we disappear behind a mound of CSI and West Wing e-mails, can you talk about this play that you wrote? Because you are over here to cast it and I just don't want to loose sight of the fact that that's what you're here for. \n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, thank you.\n\nSimon Mayo: Explain this play and what you are doing here, Jorja.\n\nJorja Fox: Well I'm lucky to be producing an original musical, it's called \"Dear Bernard\", we call it in the States. it's quickly being renamed to \"[[Dear Bernard]]\" \\pronouncing it Bernerd\\. It's going over at Riverside Studios, end of July, of this year, so.\n\nSimon Mayo: In Hammersmith in London.\n\nJorja Fox: Yes, exactly. Same place where \"Exonerated\" is right now. Great theater space and we are here to cast. This is a musical we did in Los Angeles two years ago. We had a great success with it, it's a lot of fun, it's a feel good show. It's fairly family oriented but it does have some edge. We're defining it as a rock and roll musical, and I think that's appropriate. And I'm just so thrilled to be here. We have been invited to put it up and, you know, it could be horrible, it could be one of the bigger, horrible risks of my life but I think it's certainly one I couldn't pass up. And one that I had to take.\n\nSimon Mayo: And what's this story?\n\nJorja Fox: The story is, it's about a young girl in the late sixties who leaves a small town in England to seek her fame and fortune in America. So, it takes place in New York City the back drop is the fashion industry, it's very Andy Worrall-esque. in the early seventy's in New York and the music reflects that also. So.\n\nSimon Mayo: And your roll is as a producer?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. \n\nSimon Mayo: You say you're casting, so is this your production company?\n\nJorja Fox:It is. Well it came out of, I've had a theater production company in Los Angeles for the past eight years called [[Honeypot Productions]]. It's on off shot of that theater company. We put up eight shows in LA and this one, being a cast of about twenty-two people got bigger than our little company could do. We sort of joined forces with some folks and it's definitely out of that. Sadly for me I just really didn't have the skill set or the talents to be in this show, which is what I really would have preferred to do.\n\nSimon Mayo: Yeah. Right.\n\nJorja Fox: So they've given me the consolation prize of producing. This theater company that I have in LA, we've done all of it. We've written shows, we've taken turns producing and directing. So my slot for this show is producing, which I'm very proud to be doing. It's a learning curve. It's kind of what I want to do when I grow up. So, I'm learning the ropes. \n\nSimon Mayo: So having done ten years of prime time television on three different series might you get to a point where you think, I've had enough of fantastically successful, award winning programs? I'm going to ditch it all and-\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you.\n\nSimon Mayo: -and make small musicals?\n\nJorja Fox: I think I worry more that everybody's getting sick and tired of me. I think my face has been all over. Particularly in the States, CSI is in syndication now so you can catch the show about three or four times a day. ER plays about three or four times a day or so.\n\nSimon Mayo: Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: I get more afraid that people are going to get sick of looking at me. And maybe they will come out for something that I am involved in behind the scenes instead. \n\nSimon Mayo: Yeah. You know that's not true, don't you?\n\nJorja Fox: Well thank you. That's very kind.\n\nSimon Mayo: Will that story transfer? The idea of British girl going to the States in the seventies, but you're doing it in a British theater.\n\nJorja Fox: Exactly. \n\nSimon Mayo: Does that change the atmosphere or the approach you are going to take?\n\nJorja Fox: Well it's already changed the name of the show from Bernard to Bernard, so I'm sure we're in for a lot of surprises.\n\nSimon Mayo: Does it work the same way?\n\nJorja Fox: I hope so. The show went off very successfully in Los Angeles. Which in some respects is an oxymoron. LA isn't a really big theater town, people sort of, they grit their teeth to go see plays in Los Angeles.\n\nSimon Mayo: Why is that?\n\nJorja Fox: I think we've evolved. Los Angeles is very much around film and television, it's got a great name for itself in that area and most people that come to seek their fame and fortune in Los Angeles come, not only for the entertainment business but specifically for film and television. I think, in American ,when we think of theater we think of Chicago or New York. The theater company that I have, most of us are originally from New York City so that was always something that we loved and we did. In LA it became something to do really because it wasn't what we were trying to do professionally. It was that thing that we got to do for fun and we got to do think that people probably wouldn't pay us to do and be more experimental because we weren't &#8212; It wasn't even sort of a professional calling card for us. It was something to do on the weekends that we enjoyed, that we missed about New York.\n\nWe'll do more in a moment, the news i coming up.\n\nSimon Mayo: Well, how do you get time to run a theater company when you've been in TV shows for ten years.\n\nJorja Fox: I drink a lot of coffee.\n\nSimon Mayo: Jorja Fox is here. Ben in London. 'I would have never guessed that Jorja was a Pinko Leftist Liberal. Her character is CSI is so very different to this, her character which is very convincing. Would you ever have considered being a forensic scientist?'\n\nJorja Fox: Wow, uh, no. But thank you very much for saying that. I barely passed sixth grade science. I have a tremendous amount of adoration and respect for my character who is so much smarter than I am and I love the science of it. The forensics I think might really be too dark for me to handle on a daily basis.\n\nSimon Mayo: Just looking at the biography your character has in Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. It's longer than- and I don't mean to be embarrassing, but it's longer than- it's a bigger biography than yours.\n\nJorja Fox: I'm sure.\n\nSimon Mayo: It's absolutely extraordinary. Your early life, your education, 'In high school Sara preferred to befriend teachers over students and she often ate alone in the library. Her physics teacher inspired her interest in science.' Did you know that? \n\nJorja Fox: No, this is all news to me.\n\nSimon Mayo: Um, 'Sara's personality is that of a loner. Her hobbies are all work related. She butted heads with Catherine Willows when they first met, but in recent season Sara seems to be in a downward spiral.' \n\nJorja Fox: Uh oh. \n\nSimon Mayo: 'Things are getting more difficult for her emotionally.' Is that true?\n\nJorja Fox: Uh oh. Yeah. Sara had a bit of a rough ride for a while. I think this past season is probably the lightest season that she has had on the series, and it was kind of refreshing and fun to do. You see her smiling a lot more, for no particular reason, really, other than there is nothing extremely traumatic happening to her that particular week.\n\nSimon Mayo: You 'hate bees'?\n\nJorja Fox: Oh, is that true?\n\nSimon Mayo: 'You use to smoke but now you use Nicorette'?\n\nJorja Fox: Sara does.\n\nSimon Mayo: 'Vomited at first autopsy.'\n\nJorja Fox: That's true.\n\nSimon Mayo: 'Generally wear slacks and tops. Likes Chilean sea bass. Puts sugar in her coffee,' you know, quite frankly there is nothing to do for some people, this is quite extraordinary. So tell us about this series because you just finished, what is it, series six?\n\nJorja Fox: Yes, year six we finished several weeks ago and the season finale premiers in the States tonight. \n\nSimon Mayo: Okay, so we get it when?\n\nJorja Fox: I think in a few weeks. Maybe six or seven weeks I think you get it. \n\nSimon Mayo: Is there anything you can tell us about the end of the season?\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, it's a shocker, probably, which we really haven't done much of. We've never really been big on cliffhangers, season cliffhangers like a lot of shows do. The last two episodes are very very surprising and just when you think you're done with the surprises at the very end of the last episode we leave you with something, uh, very different than anything we've ever done.\n\nSimon Mayo: And why is that? Is that just the desire to up the ante? A bite, just the need ot do something exciting? \n\nJorja Fox: I think that it was the writer ultimately, and we changed our season ending. We originally had a different idea and now there is this idea. I think the writers are excited to tell a story on CSI that we haven't quite told yet. So if anything it may take next season in a slightly different direction than we've ever gone before. It's not going to dominate the show by any means, but it's something that the writers haven't had the chance to let out of the bag.\n\nSimon Mayo: It sounds as though you have quite a lot of input into the tone, the feel, maybe even the stories that are being told.\n\nJorja Fox: This particular story came from left field. I think for all of us, I think it was a complete surprise and yes that's true. From the very beginning of the show everyone has had a lot of input. William Petersen, who plays Grissom, comes from theater in Chicago and it's the only way the he attested that he knew how to work which is sort of in a communal collective environment, so at the beginning of the show he said I would love to do this show, but if I do it we are all going to have to work together and he set the stage for that and everybody 's fallen in really beautifully. It's very rare in television that, uh, actors and writers and directors get together and talk about things and try and try and come up with ideas that everyone likes. So, it's great.\n\nSimon Mayo: So, can you say 'I don't think so' or 'I'm not sure' or 'how about I say it differently?'\n\nJorja Fox: Yes. Absolutely. There is always that invitation and there is battles that you lose. I've certainly lost, you know, and it tends to be a little bit 'majority rules.' So if there is two of us you fight it out or hopefully till you come to peace. Sometimes it's the writer the director and the actor. I'm happy to bow out if I'm the only one who has a certain feeling about something. But they are really great at letting us believe that we know our characters better than anybody else at this point because all we do is our characters.\n\nSimon Mayo: Alan Alda was in here a couple weeks ago. \n\nJorja Fox: Huge fan.\n\nSimon Mayo: And we talked about his book. It's not an autobiography, it's a memoir, but anyway. We talked about MASH and it was quite clear form the book and what he was saying that the more he got involved, the longer it went on, the more crucial he was. And he ended up writing, directing.\n\nJorja Fox: Yes.\n\nSimon Mayo: Is there a limit to what you want to do with CSI? Have they said, 'Jorja, how do you fancy directing an episode'?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, gosh, I don't think I have any skills at all for directing. I would probably turn that down very flatteringly. I did, very early in the show, go to them and ask them if I could write an episode. And they kind of very naively, I think they said to me, 'you know what, in season four you can write and episode.' And I think they thought at that point that we would never have a season four. Season four came along and ironically enough I started on this play, \"Dear Bernard\", so I opted out of try to write a show. It's still on my list. It's something I've been invited to do and I don't know if it will ever make the air, but they are certainly going to let me write one.\n\nSimon Mayo: Peter, on this e-mail, Peter McGraff says 'My car was broken into recently and the CSI that turned up looked absolutely nothing like Jorja. I wouldn't have smashed my own car window if I had known they didn't all look like Jorja Fox. I'm not telling you where I live,' says Peter, 'in case the police come and get me.' \n\nJorja Fox: Thank you, Peter.\n\nSimon Mayo: This is Richard in Brighton, 'Great to hear Jorja on the radio. You must have a great agent to get you into all those programs.' That's true actually. To have been, and still be in, CSI and the West Wing and ER, do you have particularly good contacts?\n\nJorja Fox: I think I do. I have a manager in Los Angeles that I meet in New York when I was nineteen years old and we've worked together through out my career. I feel very faithful and loyal for that relationship. Certainly I think she has gotten me almost every I've ever had.\n\nSimon Mayo: Richard continues, he says, 'I watch all the CSI's and of the franchise Vegas is by far the best. Two questions: Do you film your casino interiors in actual Vegas casinos or is it a sound stage?' He sounds like he knows his stuff I think.\n\nJorja Fox: That's one question.\n\nSimon Mayo: I'll give you both. You'll handle them both together? 'What was the deal with Nick Stokes moustache for a couple of episodes? That was weird.' \n\nJorja Fox: Oh.\n\nSimon Mayo: Well he lots me on that, but I was with him on the first.\n\nJorja Fox: Well the casino, well most of them we do. We shoot in Los Angeles primarily and we go to Vegas four or five times a year. So most of those casino scenes do happen in Vegas, and we are very grateful for that because it's a lot of fun to go there and break it up. Although we don't stay there for very long, because if you stay to long you get into trouble and you lose a lot of money and stuff like that. As far as beloved George'ns fashion choices this year and style choices, I shouldn't really speak to them at all. I think that they-\n\nSimon Mayo: So what did this moustache look like?\n\nJorja Fox: You know I thought it, you know I'm from the South, in America, and I personally thought the moustache was very sexy and a lot of men in the South sport moustaches actually in a lot of rural areas all over America they sport moustaches. \n\nSimon Mayo: I never realized it was a kind of rural urban thing. \n\nJorja Fox: Well ...\n\nSimon Mayo: If you're out in the country you wear a moustache if you're in the cities you-\n\nJorja Fox: You just don't shave. \n\nSimon Mayo: You just don't shave at all.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\nSimon Mayo: Okay. So you quite liked his moustache did you?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah I thought it was great. It was amazing how shocking it was. We got I think more responses about George's moustache than a lot of other stuff we have done. I certainly respect your opinion about the moustache.\n\nSimon Mayo: Susan in Holland Park said, 'We you are wadding thought', well, she says 'bowls,' but it might be 'bowels,' anyway, stomach contents on CSI, 'do you ever start gagging?' Because it's pretty gruesome. I know sometimes when it's on I'm eating dinner and I have to stop. 'Great show,' Says Susan. \n\nJorja Fox: Thank you. Uh, I never eat and watch the show. You're very brave, and the same time. I think I'm the most squeamish member of the cast and it's come to a point where people play jokes on me and I think they do give me some of the gorier story lines because they know I respond to them so strongly. And it's funny because it's not really the actuality of what I'm looking at that disturbs me so much, but it's really how the people died, which is violently. You know, that's really the part I think that gets to me.\n\nSimon Mayo: Rod in Bradford, 'in CSI why don't you all turn the lights on when you're in a dark room? You might get clues. All you use is torches.'\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. That's a popular one. But the flashlights are so cool right?\n\nSimon Mayo: They do look good. Boy that's a powerful torch light you got there. Um, is true that, uh, not only have more women wanted to get into this as a proper career as a result of the TV series, but also US juries are wanting higher standards of technical proof because they know what is expected on CSI?\n\nJorja Fox: It's my understanding that yes, both of those things are true. There's pros and cons to it, you know? As far a juries, there's stuff that used to take lawyers several days to describe to juries or for them to understand and comprehend that now they can explain in ten or fifteen minutes because of the show, and, uh, and then there's thing were people in the States of how, you know if they are a victim of a crime then things are going to happen much quicker than they think or for instance this gentlemen whose care was broken into, everyone expects the CSI to come out and kind of get to the bottom of that in an hour or two, so that's been a downside to it.\n\nSimon Mayo: Because people now know exactly, having watched your program and others and British versions of it we're all now experts.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\nSimon Mayo: In this evidence. We could probably tell them what to do when they get there. Um, your \"Dear Bernard\", \"Dear Bernard\", when does it does it start, when can we get to see that?\n\nJorja Fox: Premiers at Riverside Studios July 21st of this year. We will be there for at least a month and, uh, come see it. It's going to be a lot of fun.\n\nSimon Mayo: And then what's next for you?\n\nJorja Fox: I'll be back at CSI early August, definitely doing another season of that. I'm playing kickball with Eric Szmanda in an adult league that's been a really fun thing the last couple of months and that's about it.\n\nSimon Mayo: Okay. Well that sounds plenty. Jorja Fox great to meet you and thank you very much for coming in.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you so much for having me.",

And then we find out that the groom's mother is tied to the back of the convertible. Things go sorta downhill from there.\n\nI get teased a lot, because I'm the squeamish one of the group. And it's not because there's a bunch of dead people around, and they're everywhere; there's at least two or three per episode. It's how they die that's horrible, you know what I mean?

This is a partial transcript.\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, yeah, this is my second time at the Genesis Awards, and I'm really excited to be invited back. They tend to spread the love around, so I think it's, it's a little special to be back a second time. Uh, I'm lucky enough tonight I'm going to be presenting a Genesis Award for 'Dramatic Television Show' that \"CSI\" is winning. So I get to present the award to a very good friend of mine who's, uh, co-executive producer and writer of the episode on \"CSI\".\n\nInterviewer: And why do you think they're winning the award tonight?\n\nJorja Fox: Um, well I think... you know it's cool, it's- it's sorta like getting recognized, you know what I mean?\n\nInterviewer: Right.\n\nJorja Fox: It's a great gift to receive for that show. Uh, it's an issue that was very close to Josh Berman's heart, the writer of the episode, and it deals with canned hunting, which is kind of a, a big, sort of widespread thing, particularly in rural America, obviously not so much in the cities. But people who have ranches and farms, um, there's a lot of money to be made, you can ship in exotic animals and stage a hunt.\n\nInterviewer: Right.\n\nJorja Fox: And uh, so this is an issue that he took a, he became sort of passionately interested in and he wrote it, and we rarely have shows, you know, in \"CSI\" where we take strong stands about things. And uh, so it was kinda nice that he did and it's been recognized like this.\n\nInterviewer: So you credit him for doing that.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah it's cool.\n\nInterviewer: Now why do you think they invited you back again this year?\n\nJorja Fox: Um, well I'm really excited, you know, I see Gretchen around from time to time at different events and uh, she had mentioned this to me a couple of months ago and when she mentioned it, actually, she said that we were nominated, but, uh, at that time who knew who was gonna win.\n\nInterviewer: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: So this is her last Genesis Awards that she's gonna be hosting, it's the 20th anniversary, she's retiring, I feel deeply honored to get to be here tonight and share it, a little bit of that with her, you know.\n\nInterviewer: Yeah. And then you're going to go...\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, yeah. So I don't know why I'm back, but I'm, I'm very glad to be back.\n\nInterviewer: Yeah. Thank you so much for-",

        "content": "\nBob Linden: ...author of \"When Elephants Weep\", \"The Pig Who Sang to the Moon\", and \"Dogs Never Lie About Love\". Um, now, uh, oh, I guess we have - is it, Jorja Fox is calling now? Okay, Jorja Fox is on the line, Chris DeRose I hope can hold on a little longer now, but Jorja Fox, I know, is in the midst of shooting right now, \"CSI\", and uh, taking a break. Jorja, welcome to Go Vegan With Bob Linden. It's, ah, great to hear from you.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you so much Bob. Hi Chris, how are you doing?\n\nChris DeRose: Good, how are you doing?\n\nJorja Fox: Very good, very good. Nice to talk to both you guys.\n\nBob Linden: Yeah, it's great to have you both on the line here and, uh, Jorja Fox, ah, people will know from, ah, her work on \"CSI\". Since ah, since 2000 she's had a starring role there and, actually, anybody who's watched television over the last ten years, um, would know Jorja Fox because she was, ah, on \"ER\" and \"The West Wing\" and \"Missing Persons\", um, and now \"CSI\". So ah, and Jorja you um, I guess often play, um, characters with a kind of a alternative lifestyle and...\n\nJorja Fox: (laughing) That's a nice way to put that.\n\nBob Linden: Yeah, and I think (laughing), and I think uh, people want to know, people in the public are curious, if you yourself are a vegetarian?\n\nJorja Fox: I am indeed a vegetarian.\n\nBob Linden: Ah-hah! Okay.\n\nJorja Fox: And ah, you know what's interesting is that the character of Sara Sidle on \"CSI\" is a vegetarian, and also when I was on \"ER\", the character I played, Dr. Maggie Doyle, was also a vegetarian. So I've been really lucky that way.\n\nBob Linden: Now, did you, um, influence the writers to make it that way? Or um, ah, was it written that way already. I mean, or, or, was it your influence in, in making the characters vegetarian.\n\nJorja Fox: Well, you know both stories are kind of similar, and they both involve pigs, oddly enough, and my love for pigs, and uh, back in the day on \"ER\", um, the writers had put into the script that my character would practice, you know, doing stitches on a pig's foot, which is sort of a common practice with doctors in residency. And I called the writer who was, y'know, there at the time, who's now on \"Law & Order\", and um, and I said to him 'is there like anything else I might practice on'? you know cause I, I just really didn't want to do the pig's foot thing, and um, and so then he immediately wrote into the story that my character was a vegetarian and that I was going to be stitching up an eggplant. And then on \"CSI\" it was a similar thing, we were going to be conducting an experiment on a pig where we're trying to prove how long somebody had been died by sort of, kind of doing the same experiment on a pig, and I called the writers and I said 'Can we please not, you know, of course we're not going to use a real pig for this, are we' and they said 'oh, are you a vegetarian?' and I said 'yes' and they wrote it into the story that my character would be a vegetarian.\n\nBob Linden: Wonderful, yeah-\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah\n\nBob Linden: &#8212; and didn't you also influence, like, not using real animals on the show or something to that effect...?\n\nJorja Fox: Well you know, of course, I, it was more naivety on my part because, you know, they would never use real animals, ah, particularly for any of the dead animals on our show. We've had some fantastic animal actors come through \"CSI\", but all of them have been alive and well and breathing and (laughs) we even have, we use a lot of bugs on the show, and we have, ah, special humane bugs' guys that are here to make sure the bugs are taken care of, and that, you know, everybody who arrives on the set leaves the set (laughs) in good shape. So yeah, we do, everybody who's dead on the show whether it's animals, or people of course, are either not real or actors portraying people that are dead, so yeah, no animals have ever been harmed in the making of \"CSI\" thank goodness, I'm proud to say.\n\nBob Linden: Ah, that's wonderful, yeah, that's, that's terrific. So um, and, and how did you yourself get interested in, in vegetarianism, and, and animal issues?\n\nJorja Fox: Um, wow. Again, I go, I've been doing this kind of stuff for so long, y'know, I say definitely that when I was a teenager, my grandmother, who's passed away now, she lived a long beautiful life, to 99, uh, I grew up in a very rural town in Florida, and it was obviously very meat and potato oriented and, she, from as long as, y'know I grew up with her in the household, she was always very very concerned with the environment, and very, a huge lover of animals, and, and a believer in compassionate, um, treatment towards animals. And so um, from a really early age I was exposed to that, and I would definitely, I would think that she was the person that was most significant in teaching me about that stuff, and I, and I, realized that I, I kinda, I felt the same way that she did, I had the same beliefs as her about it.\n\nBob Linden: So, uh, and when did you become vegetarian? Was there a moment...?\n\nJorja Fox: Ah, I was nineteen years old in New York City, and I was in Brooklyn, and I was eating a meatball hero, and I don't know what happened, I just looked at the sandwich, and I just, it all just clicked in my head, and that was it, I've never eaten meat again.\n\nBob Linden: Yeah. I was, uh, I was nineteen in New York City and I was looking down at a piece of chicken I just cooked and I said 'Ah, it's a body!'\n\nJorja Fox: No kidding!\n\nBob Linden: You know, it's a-\n\nJorja Fox: Yuck! Something just all of a sudden, you know, there's just a register there. And you know, I've been really blessed, I lived a lot of big cities, you know it is really easy to have a vegetarian lifestyle in Los Angeles, New York, and places like Chicago, and um, I'm really grateful for it, I'm really grateful for the knowledge, y'know?\n\nBob Linden: Yeah, definitely. Oh we have, in L.A. we have vegan restaurants everywhere now, it seems.\n\nJorja Fox: Mmm-hmm. Just in the last couple of years-\n\nBob Linden: Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: &#8212; like a (???)\n\nBob Linden: They're thriving, yeah. I mean, they're, so that's, so that's great. Now, you know, if you, if you look at your acting resume though, I mean, these are amazingly, these are the biggest shows of, of the last few years, and um, how did we get these roles, how uh, how uh does an \"ER\", \"West Wing\" and \"CSI\" happen? \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" is like the biggest show, you know that cause there are so many spin-offs on it, you know, so uh, um, how did it, how did it happen for you?\n\nJorja Fox: Oh, thank you, thank you. You know, I don't know, I really just think, y'know, I really just think I'm the luckiest person you know, this, Los Angeles has been really really good to me, everything was kind of just the normal way, like my agent sent me on an audition and I went in, and I had a callback, and then I came back, and I, I feel really really blessed I'm uh, right now I'm in my eleventh consecutive season on primetime television,\n\nBob Linden: Wow.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, and who knew? I never thought I'd get where I am so I'm, I'm [in] completely uncharted territory. I know, ah, there's other people that are in the club with me but, other than Noah Wyle I'm not really sure, I don't know exactly who they are. But uh, yeah, it's, it's much huger than my wildest dreams I could've ever thought.\n\nBob Linden: So, so it wasn't at all the producers in Hollywood were vegan and sympathetic to you necessarily.\n\nJorja Fox: (laughs) No, I wish, I wish. That'd be pretty fabulous.\n\nBob Linden: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anything exciting coming up for \"CSI\" this year?\n\nJorja Fox: Oh we're really excited. We premiere September 21st, Thursday mights, you've got a two-parter episode, ah, that we're going to start the season out with, it's very very high stakes, very traditional, you see most of our season premieres there's, you know, Vegas is highlighted beautifully, a lot of night shots, and, and exteriors, and there's deep deep trouble for Marg Helgenberger's character Catherine Willows, it's gonna be quite a thrill ride the first few shows, we're excited about it.\n\nBob Linden: Excellent, excellent. Well I'm uh, and, and you're shooting today, right now? You, you ran off?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, they've actually knocked on my trailer door two minutes ago, they want me to go to set and uh, yeah.\n\nBob Linden: Tell them, tell them you're on \"Go Vegan with Bob Linden\"-\n\nJorja Fox: I know, I'm a (???)\n\nBob Linden: -and I'm sure they'll understand.\n\nJorja Fox: I'm gettin' to talk to Bob, which is quite an honor and very rare. Yeah, there's uh, you know there's somebody dead and I gotta go check on some dead person, find out what happened to them.\n\nBob Linden: Okay. Well if you ever need, y'know like, uh, a dead vegan who needs to lie there, I'll be glad to audition.\n\nJorja Fox: (laughs)\n\nBob Linden: Although, y'know, wait a second, vegan and dead don't go together, actually vegan and life go together.\n\nJorja Fox: Exactly, yeah you're right.\n\nBob Linden: So I guess I'm-\n\nJorja Fox: Tell you what though, I'm going to present that to the producers today.\n\nBob Linden: What's that?\n\nJorja Fox: I said thank you very much so I'm going to present that to the producers today.\n\nBob Linden: Apparent, yeah, please do that, or, or a live vegan talk show host. Either way, I mean that uh-\n\nJorja Fox: Okay.\n\nBob Linden: Glad to read for it.\n\nJorja Fox: Sounds good.\n\nBob Linden: Okay then go back to work then, Jorja Fox. Um by the way, uh, what's the, the spelling of your name is uh, do you need help or uh getting it right or uh-\n\nJorja Fox: (laughs)\n\nBob Linden: How do you-\n\nJorja Fox: (laughing) My mother made that up.\n\nBob Linden: How do we, how do we have Jorja from J, O, R, J, A? How did, how did, how did you uh get a spelling like that? What's the derivation?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, yeah, for better, for worse, my mom made it up, I'm a child of the 70's, and uh, she was from Montreal, French-Canadian, so my name is actually very common there, Jorja-An, and she just threw in the J's to uh, mix it up a little bit and confuse me for like the first twelve years of my life.\n\nBob Linden: (laughs)\n\nJorja Fox: (chuckles)\n\nBob Linden: And that made you an actor, so-\n\nJorja Fox: Oh yeah, yeah. (laughs) My early childhood pain.\n\nBob Linden: Yes, your early childhood pain. Well thank you, go back to work.\n\nJorja Fox: Thanks Bob, thanks Chris, have a, have a beautiful day.\n\nChris DeRose: Thank you, bye-bye Jorja.\n\nJorja Fox: Thanks a lot.\n\nBob Linden: Okay, I'll go directly to Chris now I think then? Yes, okay, because Chris has been patiently waiting and Jorja was just taking a quick break from, uh, shooting right now and Chris DeRose who gosh, has been on this show quite often, so you know that he founded and is the president of Last Chance For Animals and um, gosh, he's just one of the heroes in the animal rights movement, but you may not know that on his resume too, well-",

        "content": "\nOne Final Question - Jorja Fox\n\nWhat's it like to be upstaged by strange fibers and fluids?\n\n*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* is the top-rated drama in the US, but there are two spin-offs now. Does it annoy you that *CSI: Miami* and now *CSI: NY* are sponging off your ratings?\n\nWell, they say it's a great form of flattery, right? I think in the beginning we were all quite afraid. Our show in the States had barely got on its legs and already we were going to have competition from the inside. So it was kind of terrifying and maybe not entirely welcomed by the cast. The good thing that's come out of it is it's kept everybody on our show humble and hungry.\n\nWe've had Miami and New York &#8212; what British fans are wondering is when are we going to see *CSI: Birmingham*?\n\nDo they really wonder that?\n\nWell, not really.\n\nWe'll see! It would probably work, but luckily enough for you guys, you don't have quite a violent society as America has. Myself, I'm rooting for maybe CSI: Hawaii, or CSI: Maldives.\n\nThe show's always full of amazingly detailed procedures and fascinating information. What's the craziest fact you've learned over the past six years?\n\nWell, one of the things I'd never really thought about is when you go into a hotel room. The physical history of the people that have been there before you is all there, laid out, but not visible to the eye.\n\nYou mean fluids and hairs?\n\nOh yeah, all that. There's a story told in every room. CSI, the TV show, has the best forensic equipment in the country &#8212; which is sort of sad &#8212; so we get to locations and all our stuff works. You turn on the ultraviolet lens and go \"urrggh!\"\n\nWith all you know now, if you were to commit a brutal murder, how would you avoid getting caught?\n\nI do believe I know how to commit the perfect murder.\n\nWant to tell us?\n\nNo, I couldn't possibly! And I should never brag about it. I was having a morbid conversation [on the subject] with one of our technical advisers, and we have a security guy on location who's special-forces trained. The two of them came up with what they thought was the easiest way to get away with a murder.\n\nSo if actors from the other *CSI* series start disappearing, we know who to go to.\n\nYeah right! I'll be a lead suspect. I'm a pacifist though, I must admit.\n\nIs your character Sara Sidle ever going to get it on with Grissom?\n\nOh gosh. We've had this crazy dance for many years &#8212; off and on, odd and on. But I still have faith for that storyline, particularly because of all the darkness these characters live with on a daily basis. It would be just a little stream of light in their lives.\n\nAs an actor, do you relish the challenge of kissing a man with a beard?\n\n[laughs] I don't want to come across as too experiences, but I have kissed a man or two with a beard in the past. With the right guy, it can actually be quite pleasant.\n\nSome of *CSI's* scenes are really gross. What's the closest you've come to losing your dinner?\n\nOh yeah. Six years of that and I'm the most squeamish member of the cast! I really feel like the writers give me those scenes intentionally becuase they think it's funny. It'll affect my day, my lunch. Two seasons ago, Eric Szmanda [CSI's Greg Sanders] and I were looking through the stomach contents of a victim. They had brought in pizza because we were working late, and both of us almost got sick. Even though it's make-believe, a lot of our stories are based on real events. It has less to do with what I'm looking at than why I'm looking at it &#8212; how they died.\n\nYou're up for World's Sexiest Vegetarian this year. Have you been on the website, voting for yourself?\n\nOnce I did, and I wondered if I could get away with repeat voting. There's stiff competition.\n\nIsn't \"world's sexiest\" discriminatory against all the ugly vegetarians out there?\n\n[laughs] That's very true.\n\nOne final question: is it depressing or frustrating being an actor in a series where the real stars are carpet fibers and glass fragments?\n\nThey steal every scene in the show! I've been consistently upstaged by things that in my more vain moments I never thought I get upstaged by. I get upstaged by the soles of shoes ...  ",

        "content": "\nJulie Chen: ... were wondering if there was more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye. Well last night we found out, and the answer is definitely yes. Now we have even more questions, and so do the CSI stars. Last night's episode was almost over when we heard Gil Grissom ruminating about the end of his own life.\n\nWilliam Petersen: And it's a little scene, but it's just a coda to the end of the season. And if we do it right, it'll seem like ... Did that just happen?\n\nChen: I was what we saw next is destined to become a classic CSI moment.\n\nJorja Fox: You know honestly Sara's never give up on Grissom. To be perfectly honest with you. And that is the big question. How long has this been going on? And I think we're all wondering that question. Including the writers at this point.\n\nChen: For years it has seemed that there was something unspoken in the relationship between Grissom and Sara.\n\nPetersen: We were doing it out in little tiny peices, just between me and Jorja. So it's a big deal for me and her, just in terms of where we're at.\n\nPetersen: And the idea is that it's intimate, it's not sexual. In any way.\n\nChen: No it's not. But-\n\nPetersen: It's the way we're gonna do it. It's intimate. It's obviously, it's like a married couple in a bedroom at night talking to each other.\n\nChen: Very comfortable with each other.\n\nPetersen: And the implication is that, I mean, for Jorja and I, it's that we've had a relationship for many years that no one's known about. That we, even in our behaviour around 'here', nobody would know.\n\nChen: Grissom might \"think\" that nobody knows about his relationship with Sara, but fellow super sleuths Catherine and Nick are far from clueless.\n\nChen: Is she going to judge it? Is she going to look at it and think-\n\nMarg Helgenberger: I don't think so. No, I don't think so at all. I think that she'll be perfectly content just sort of watching it unfold and watching them trying to keep it a secret.\n\nGeorge Eads: He sees the way they look at each other. He ... I think understands Sara very well. Doesn't everyone just love Grissom? I mean there's just something eccentric and weird and kooky and cool and awesome about Grissom, man.\n\nFox: One of the greatest gifts in this cliffhanger for Sara, irregardless of what it turns out to be, is there's this tiniest little ray of sunshine in that scene, that we don't get to see these characters have that much. They really, they live in the shadows, they live in the dark sides of people lives. And here's this little bit of oxygen that just kinda got blown into this space where we find Grissom and Sara. So that's a really interesting thing to maybe have to look forward to next season.\n\nChen: Now last night's CSI might have given us one cliffhanger, but it resolved another. Jim Brass was clinging to life after being shot, but the good news is the character will be around for season number seven.  ",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox \"(on Billy Petersen leaving the show for four weeks in November of 2006)\" I wasn't disappointed at all, I think, you know, obviously as I met Billy he had come almost directly out of this excitement of theater he was doing in Chicago and he's very famous for that theater that he's done. I think that it's been the heart of his work over the time of his career, he's done some films that are ground-breaking and memorable and everybody, those, that's probably the way that the most people know Billy Petersen, but I think that people who know Billy Petersen \"know\" that his heart and his soul has always been in the theater, so, and it's almost as if in a sense odd that it took him six years to find his way into one, you know, and I think that it's a testament to the show, how much \"CSI:\" has all this passion that he hasn't felt like he could go do a play at the same time. Cause he's also fairly multi-faceted, much more so than I am and I think some of us are on the show.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox From the very beginning of the inception of my character coming on to the pro- the show of \"CSI:\" and them deciding to add this character, there's this little piece of paper that you get when you go to audition for these roles, and, and , I think the first sentence said &#8216;love interest for Grissom'. So from like day one of me kind of going for the audition this was a story that hung there in the ethers and then, you know, as we started to go into season 1 and season 2 and started to realize that we were going to have a season 3 I think there was interest on everybody's part not to, so to speak, &#8216;blow our wad' too soon, you know \"(laughs)\". You tell this story then where do you go from there and it could be, you know, if we were lucky enough which it \"seemed\" might be happening, there'd be years of awkwardness after the break-up or stuff that you know \"(laughs)\" we didn't want to play for three seasons. So I think that it, it was kind of wise to hold back on it and, and then we got to a point where we thought that maybe the fans were not interested in it any more.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox \"(voiceover)\" We'd already begun shooting the last episode of season 6, the script had been out, there was an ending set, and I got a call from Carol Mendelsohn suggesting 'hey, what do you think about this and would you want to do this' and is this interesting to you. Which is also something that's great about this show and I think very unique is I don't know how often actors get those calls. I was shocked, very surprised, and, and, and very very intrigued. I thought it could make season 7 extremely interesting for my character and certainly a storyline that I had always been gearing up to play and wanted to play, and I've always loved the dynamic between Grissom and Sara, I love that it's a \"little\" bit sort of scandalous, it's untraditional in, in a couple of respects, and I love those kinds of love stories. So... I was thrilled.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox It's a complete and utter shock and surprise. First of all I can't believe it's been seven years. One of the reasons I \"hate\" doing interviews like this is 'cause I'm reminded that it's been seven years, \"(laughs)\" because it doesn't feel like seven years. It's like &#8216;yeah, a couple of years', you know, it's the coolest thing ever, I never could have even wished for this, to be a part of a show this long and never would have expected that it would ever happen and I can't believe that it has, in many respects, we still have a gazillion cool stories left to tell. So... yeah, it's pretty weird.  \n",

        "content": "\n\"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - Why Season 7 is so great\"\n\nJorja Fox: What separates season 7 from all the other seasons in \"CSI\" is for a very long time, we're very content that our stories sort of had a beginning, a middle and an end within themselves, so if you watch a show from season 3 or season 1 or season 5 you kinda could watch them and they didn't have to be in a particular order, you know. This year, almost everything that we're seeing is going to lead to something.\n\n \"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - Sara's affair with Grissom\"\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, it's always a surprise to me actually when that storyline gets tipped and uh, from the very beginning, the inception of my character coming on to the pr-, this, the show of \"CSI\", them deciding to add this character, there's this little piece of paper that you get when you go to audition for these roles and, and I think the first sentence said \"love interest for Grissom\". So from day one of me kinda going for the audition this was a story that hung there in the ethers and then you know as we started to go into season 1 and season 2 and realize that we were going to \"have\" a season 3, I think there was interest on everybody's part of not to, so to speak, \"blow our wad\" too soon, you know, \"(laughs)\" you tell this story and where do you go from there, and it could be, you know, if we were lucky enough, which it seemed might be happening, there would be years of awkwardness after the break-up or you know, stuff that \"(laughs)\" we didn't want to play for three seasons, so uh, I think that ah, it, it was kind of wise to hold back on it and, and then we got to the point we thought that fans were not interested in it anymore, there would be a story that had sort of been played out, wasn't going to happen, you know, the, the stars didn't align for those two characters.\n\n\"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - Revealing the affair with Grissom\"\n\nJorja Fox: ... they worked together, obviously this is a mystery we hoped to unravel this year, how long have they been seeing each other outside of the office, it seems obvious in that finale that that wasn't the first time that they found themselves in the bedroom together. There was what we hoped to play sort of the familiarity, that this was, you know so was that, did that happen in season 2, was it season 4, was this something that lingered from San Francisco where, you know, Sara and Grissom, you know, are sort of reported to have met and gotten to know each other, and there was one thing one thing \"certain\" in episode 1 of season 1 that the two characters had some kind of history, it wasn't the first time they were meeting, there was a, a past there for them.\n\n \"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - Roger Daltry in \"Living Legend\"\"\n\nJorja Fox: Wow, that was huge, I mean that was really huge. I mean, I, I'm a long long standing Who fan. You know my brother's twelve years older than I am and when he went to college he gave me all of his rock 'n roll records, and he had a pretty good collection and there was a lot of Who in it, so I'd say I was five \"(laughs)\" when I started listening to the Who, and, and I've, I've loved them and seen them in concert several times you know, in California, and you know, we, we somehow attracted this little theme song that we've got, you know, that, and, and, I remember, again, going \"way\" back reminiscing with you some memory lane when standing up in this area called Santa Clarita that we used to shoot in there's nothing there, I mean nothing, I mean there's actually a lot more there now than there was six years ago, it's an area that's been built up so much over the last six years. And, and Billy's standing there, and I'm standing there, and Gary's standing there, and we're talking about what's going to be the theme song for \"CSI\", you know, and then he's saying \"well, there's this Who song\" and we thought, you know that's never going to happen, that's a great idea Billy, but that's never gonna happen, you know, he doesn't do TV shows, and, and then lo and behold it happened, and, and it's done... enormous things for the show just in terms of that one song, you know, people \"know\" that song, they now, I think, when they hear it they think of us too, you know, and...\n\n\"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - The \"Miniatures\" story arc\"\n\nJorja Fox: Grissom arrives at the crime scene, and sitting on the counter at the crime scene is an exact replica of the crime scene so it's a crime scene within a crime scene and it's odd, and it's fascinating, interesting, nobody's ever seen anything like it before, and I think that everybody decides that it's an anomaly, it's not gonna happen again, and lo and behold a few episodes pass and it's reoccurred...\n\n \"Jorja Fox \"Sara Sidle\" - Greg Sanders \"Fannysmackin'\"\"\n\nJorja Fox: For Eric it's a really, uh, really great storyline for him, you know, it's all about that moment, where there's a moment in time, and you have a very very short amount of time to make a decision and what are the ramifications of that decision. I think everyone, you know, in life at some point in our lives have that moment, you know, it might not have necessarily, the stakes might not have been as high as they were for Greg or as life-threatening, but you know it's just a moment where you tell somebody you had an affair or you don't, or you know, you decide to walk out of a relationship or you don't and then \"everything\" changes from that, your entire life changes from this moment in time where someone you love gets hit by a bus, any of those things, people have been through that and uh, it's really cool to see the results of that.",

        "content": " \n\"Why Sara decided to leave\"\n\nJorja Fox: ...you know, a series of events between the whole miniature killer thing and some other events, she'd had so many recent close calls. Um, the job was just too much for her to, it was too much with her, and I think she knew that if she asked Grissom to go with her, even if he said yes, that would be the end of him, you know \"(very emotional)\". Grissom, this, the lab for him is his whole world, it's every, the place where he's felt safe, it's where he's been for 20 years, it's his everything. Um, so I think she knew, she never, she never even asked, she would never even ask him to go, I think she... thought it would kill him to go, and it was going to kill her to stay.\n\n \"Sara's departure\"\n\nJorja Fox: I thought she had a really dignified goodbye and a really loving goodbye, there was a lot of grace to it, and um, so I was \"thrilled\" by that, you know. It was, it made me a little uncomfortable in a way, cause you know there were several episodes that became very Sara heavy and I think that all of us on the show, we are an ensemble and we're really used to sharing, you know you might get one episode and then you were light for a while and then you're back, so you know I, me, Jorja, as myself I was slightly embarrassed by the whole thing, by the attention, but, um, I was really happy for the character, that, you know, I thought that, um, it was a really kind thing for them to do.\n\n\"Happy that Sara wasn't killed off\"\n\nJorja Fox: I'm really glad that she's just... somewhere in the ethers right now, you know. I have ideas about where she is, and, um, I'm sure Carol Mendelsohn does too but, that um, she wasn't, you know, that there's... that she's alive and well. I think that there's, there's several different options when um, you're going to give a character a send-off and I think that particularly for the character of Sara, she'd been through \"so\" much, sort of \"heaviness\" in her life, and violence and darkness and I, and I kind of always have seen in her someone who has always been able to \"surmount\" a lot of difficulties, you know, to have sort of a reasonably sane happy life. To me, for her to have been a victim of violence in the end would have been absolutely devastating, and, and horrific to me that she, she, she already did that, she already went through that and survived and came out the other side, so, um, I'm \"really\" happy that the writers decided not to kill her off.\n\n \"Planning her departure\"\n\nJorja Fox: I knew going into season 8 that I was going to do the first seven episodes of season 8, so I, so I absolutely knew that, and um, I think I'd known for about a year or a year and a half that um, that I was thinking about going, you know, sort of just on my own sort of space that um, again I've been so lucky, I've been eleven and a half years consistently on prime time TV so, um, after eleven and a half years I think I was ready to take a little break, just a little break, and um, a little break from the violence, cause eight beautiful years of violence is a lot, and uh, and a lot of stories that we tell are based on real stories, you know. It's um, it's sort of not just pure imagination a lot of the time so it adds sort of a heavier sense to the show.\n\n\"Saying goodbye\"\n\nJorja Fox: I think the \"hardest\" part was really feeling like it was \"definitely\" the longest goodbye of my entire life. I mean, we all knew it, you know, all the actors knew it and the crew knew it and the writers knew it and so there was a good two or three month period where I felt like I was saying goodbye to everybody almost every day and that, and that was heartbreaking, it was really hard, and I almost \"wished\" during that time that it \"had\" been a shock to all of us, you know, and that I didn't know it was happening. It seems, you know, I've never been one for long goodbyes anyway, I'm the kind that likes to drop people off at the airport and not go in, and uh, so it was \"very emotional\" \"(laughing)\" sort of, uh, way and I think I was really lucky too because a lot of the feelings that \"I\" was going through were feelings that I, that would work with the storyline and the character, they were feelings that the character was going through. Like it this, it was the hardest thing I've ever done was to leave the show, and it was a lot harder to leave than stay in many respects, and um, and so, and so luckily for \"me\" the character was sort of taking, making the same decisions at that time, you know, that I'm sure that the hardest thing she ever did was to leave the Las Vegas crime lab, and leave Greg Sanders and Nick Stokes and Gil Grissom and um, this \"family\" that she had created, you know, and Warrick Brown - everyone there.\n\n \"Writing Sara's goodbye letter for Naren Shankar\"\n\nJorja Fox: We were having a conversation about this storyline, and um, he asked me if, what, if I were gonna say 'goodbye', what would I say, if I were writing a letter, Sara was writing a letter to Grissom, what would it say. And, and, so it was a homework assignment, that he kind of gave me which I didn't get that often, I went off to hair and makeup, and in hair and makeup I wrote it and then I gave it to him on a scrap piece of paper and um, and then he, and then when I got the script, you know, a few days later, I was completely blown away that it was the letter that I had written. I thought, you know, he'd kind of just look at me and 'oh, that's okay, that's kind of what she would say' and then he'd, he'd write, \"write\" something, write something real, so um, yeah, that was a \"complete\" surprise to me.\n\n\"Saying goodbye to the CSI family\"\n\nJorja Fox: In the letter she leaves for Grissom, uh, she says that it's definitely the closest thing she's ever had to a home, you know, was, was, those seven years there in that place, those people, and um, those bonds, I mean, you know, for me, and again, that's where the character and the person are so intertwined in some respects and so you know, I just spent my morning with Marg and Billy, and um, they're my \"family\", you know, I, I feel that... in twelve years if I got a call out of the blue from Paul Guilfoyle, you know, to go to his house, I'd be there probably, you know, as fast as I could. So, and, and I think that there's no question in my mind that Sara shares those feelings for the people that she worked with there.  ",

Cast members told me those models were as fascinating for them as they were for viewers. [...] This season we were also drawn in by the complicated secret romance between Grissom and Sara.

She flirts with danger, almost getting strangled to death playing out a Western town fantasy. She flirts with Grissom, too, as far back as their first meeting, six years ago.

Instead of voting, going out to vote for someone you're going out to vote against someone that you...\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox: I'm glad that there's a bunch of people that I like, you know, I'm sort, for me, I tend towards the left, and it's nice to see a group of several people that I'm like \"oh, wow, who's it going to be it's such a hard choice\". I'm thinking in years past-\n\nJoy: Well they could still lose it.\n\nJorja Fox: Well one of them, right, one, or someone, will represent the Democrats.\n\n[...]\n\nMolly Shannon: \"(to Jorja)\" I love your new house.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox: What did it take you, actually, to get into comedy?\n\nMolly Shannon: Oh, who..\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, how did, how did you find this life for yourself?\n\n[...]\n\nJorja Fox: \"(about Molly Shannon's new film)\" It's fantastic.\n\nMolly Shannon: Thank you.\n\nJorja Fox: There's three different parts and they're all you.

        "content": "\nQuestion - about Sara Sidle(?)  \n\nJorja Fox: Uh, yes, well I think that Marg and I feel very very lucky to play the women we get to play on TV, you know. The character I get to play is \"so\" much smarter than I am, number one, \"(laughs)\" which is really fun, you never get tired of doing that, and they're just, you know they're strong women, and they're professional, they're completely intellectual and at the same time they feel very real, they feel like real people to me, they don't feel, feels like a person that somebody could actually be. You know sometimes you see movies and television, which is very entertaining, but it's, it's, it's sort of someone who is very, you know, the superhero or the perfect beautiful person and the life that they get to lead, and I think that Marg and I get to play people that regular people can identify with, they say \"Oh, I could be that person\" or \"I could do that\". Uh, that's a really wonderful thing to get to do.\n\n Question - about fan mail  \n\nJorja Fox: From time to time, yes, and from Japan, I've definitely received letters from Japan, which is really very wonderful. Um, I get a lot of letters from teenagers which is really nice. I think that when we started the show I thought we were going to get a lot of mail from jail, from prisoners \"(laughs)\", and mail sort of, I don't know, I thought the mail would be more eccentric than it's been. It's been, it's been really nice, supportive, very sort of sane fan mail. Which I would have never expected.\n\nQuestion - about the best episode(?)  \n\nJorja Fox: Uh, \"A Bullet Runs Through It\", and I believe they're from season six, and they're actually a two-parter episode, and there's a, a, an incident that happens in a low income neighborhood in Los Vegas and the cops swoop down on the event, and everyone's got a different visual idea of what they think happened. So the community is very angry at the police, the police are very angry at the community, and we spend, uh, two episodes almost finding out actually what happened at the crime. And um, I feel that it's, you know, it's a very timely episode, at least for us in America, I think this kind of thing happens a lot, there's a lot of distrust of police and authorities, a lot of people feel very disenfranchised, and of course we had Hurricane Katrina here last year, and there were a lot of citizens that felt like, uh, the people that are supposed to protect them really let them down, or never showed up, and um, and uh I also think that we live in a time where there's a lot of escalation of fear, and, and the idea that uh, you know, people are afraid of things, some of them rational, some aren't rational, and I think that people, at least in America, there's a very split situation happening politically, with a lot of people - we're talking about millions and millions of people - and, and they have very short tempers right now. So rather than sitting down and talking things through, they're leaping to anger very quickly and leaping to violence very quickly and, and that episode for me, has a lot of those issues and ideas in it, and I thought it was really beautifully written and kind of gutsy, we don't tell a lot of stories, we don't put a lot of moral, moral feelings into a lot of our stories, we sort of just tell a story and let people decide for themselves. And this one I think the writers couldn't help a little bit, they just put a little bit a sense of themselves into it, and that's sort of a brave way that I really liked a lot. \"(listens to translator)\" Yeah, yeah, I think it's really good. I think, you know, we'll see what happens in season seven but I think the most powerful episode to date's been that one.\n\nQuestion - about Sara and Grissom\n\nJorja Fox: \"(laughing)\" Sara and Grissom. Well you know Sara, coming into season five, kind of decided that she's not going to chase Grissom any more. I think she finally recognized after almost three, four years of chasing him around, and he's turned her down, and he's said 'no' to dates several times, she's decided that she's gonna try and move on, you know, and of course we all know that the ones that get away are sort of the ones that are definitely the hardest to forget and hardest to, to do that with. So, there's a bit of a struggle there, um, you know she's just trying, she's just trying to move on.\n\nQuestion - about William Petersen  \n\nJorja Fox: Uh, I think he'll be, ah, really overjoyed. He's incredibly charming, and, and wonderful, he's an amazing listener, creatively I think he's absolutely brilliant. When he, uh, started with \"CSI\" he had come from a theater background in Chicago, Illinois in the States and the only way that he really knows how to work is collectively and communally and where people develop ideas together, the stories together, and um he had kind of said to everyone at CBS, the writers, that, that's the way this show would have to be or else he wouldn't know how to work in this environ-, in that environment and so from the very beginning we had a very collective show, and it's pretty rare on television. And um, and the writers get together and they have think tanks and they break stories together and they work on stories together and even when sometimes, when the story gets to the set the writer, the actors, the director might still be discussing it, they might make changes on the set, and so it really makes working really fun and interesting, and also you have to stay on your toes because things you think are happening may not happen the way that you thought when you got to work. And, and he really brings that spirit to the set and everyone has, he listens to everyone, everyone has an opinion and they've got values and he's funny. He's, he's, you know, obviously he's my most favorite scene partner I've ever had and, um it's been really exciting to, to take this journey not only with everyone but specifically with him. And um, I think both he and I feel very very invested in the characters and we're wishing that our characters at some point \"way\" down the road have a happy ending somewhere, whatever that looks like.\n\nQuestion - Billy Petersen vs. Gil Grissom  \n\nJorja Fox: \"(smiling)\" Yeah, absolutely. \"(listening to off-camera question)\" Mmmm-hmmm. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely, and it does, it's the same. And he'll tell you that he has absolutely nothing at all in common with Grissom, and ah, some of us know that that's \"(laughing)\" not entirely true. Um, but yeah, just the professionalism, and, and the focus, he's tireless. You know, we would work, you know, many many many long hours, and especially in maybe our first three or four seasons of the show in almost every scene, no matter how tired he was, and, and how far into the season we were he would come into work and give 150%. And I think that also, everybody around him is very contagious, you know, to someone that has that kind of enthusiasm. Um, yeah, he's calm and very forgiving, you know, Grissom is certainly, and the other thing that's great about Grissom is he's always busy doing what he's doing, so he's not paying \"too\" much attention on the rest of us, we really get to go out and solve our own crimes, and, and that's cool too.",

I knew that might happen, I didn't know it was gonna happen so soon. But, uh, so it was a surprise. It's always a surprise, really. And it's been really great, it's great. \n\nAusiello: Now Grissom/Sara might ... ride off into the sunset together? In his final episode?\n\nFox: Well. I guess there's kind of two options, right? Either they end up together or they don't. So &#8212; and I don't know either!\n\nAusiello: You don't know yet!?\n\nFox: No, no I don't. I haven't started that episode yet. And I really believe it's going to be one of those shows that, until it's all shot, anything could happen. I wouldn't even be surprised &#8212; We almost &#8212; We never do more than one ending, but I wouldn't be surprised if we did on this one.\n\nAusiello: What was it like coming back? Like after being away for a year?\n\nFox: Uh. In some ways if felt like I had been gone just for the weekend. Like I had never left. Strangely so normal. And then, on the other hand, it was just crazy. Cause I had had this big, dramatic, goodbye, and the hugs and the cake and \"I love you\" and you know, a couple months pass and there I was. It felt, sort of, really very dramatic about my exit. Not knowing, you know what I mean, three months would pass and I'd be all \"Hey, hi, everyone! Yeah, here I am.'\n\nAusiello: What are you going to do after you wrap your \"CSI\" run?\n\nFox: I don't know. I really don't know, you know what I mean? There's a few options and I'm looking at some TV stuff now, I'm looking at some feature stuff. Mostly I've been goofing off. You probably know that. I've been having &#8212; I don't know whether it's a mid-life crisis or what, but ... some remote beach, or I've visited Alaska this year. I've had jet engines for legs, which, really, I feel blessed and so fortunate. So now I'm starting to get the itch to work, so. Yeah. I'm looking at a few different things.\n\nAusiello: Do people ever come up to you and say \"God, you left the number one series on TV, what's wrong with you?'\n\nFox: Yeah, that happens. And I actually agree with them, sort of, half the time. Me, you know it was my twelfth season in a row, and everybody else on the show it was their eighth or ninth. And I just &#8212; I needed a break. I hadn't had this part of my life mapped out at all. I kind of felt like I needed to take some air and figure out what I want that to look like. You know, do I want to stay in TV, if I'm lucky enough to do so? Do I want to go get a degree in, like, economics? What do- I- It's uncharted territory for me.\n\nAusiello: Why do you think \"CSI\" hasn't gotten more Emmy love, or doesn't get it?\n\nFox: That's so nice of you to say. You know, I feel like I was lucky enough to be on \"[[ER]]\" for three years, and they didn't get a lot of Emmy love either. I'd like to think that we've the honor of being the most popular and so, the world sort of spreads these honors around, those gifts around. So we get to be that, we're \"still\" number one. We rarely brag, but it's like, how's that even possible? We're still number one? But we are. So maybe that's enough and we should be really happy. I would have loved to see Billy get nominated this year, I feel he really deserves it. After nine solid years of being the heart and soul of that show. If anybody should take one home, I think he should.  ",

I've even had a friend come in from out of town and she's so excited. \n\nInterviewer: Unintelligible\n\nJorja Fox: I think it's a convergence of a lot of different people who almost never get to see each other. That's number one. And because so many people are coming out tomorrow night anywhere, they're here, they're getting ready, they're excited, they're adrenaline is high. So almost everybody comes out tonight. I can't believe how dressed up everybody gets. For me, you know, I'm not going to the Emmys tomorrow, CSI's not nominated. So it's great for me to get dressed up. If I was going to the Emmys tomorrow, I'd probably be here in flip flops and jeans, just cause it's a lot! It's like a fourteen hour day! But people really worked it out, people look great today. \n\nInterviewer: Unintelligible\n\nJorja Fox: This is the work part! I know that it's hard to believe it, that this is part of the job. But if you're lucky. Once you get inside, it's not too work-y. It's really kind of social. And especially there are a lot of New Yorkers who are never here, that are here, and a couple Canadians, and the documentary people that are always wherever in Swazziland. It's cool to get to kind of hang out and celebrate your work. That you're lucky enough to be here and doing what you love. \n\nInterviewer: Unintelligible\n\nJorja Fox: Thanks.",

And like ...\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah!\n\nIan Harvie: And like \"ER\" and like, seriously, like, all these-\n\nJorja Fox: laughing It was the dialog! It was so hard! I couldn't do it anymore.\n\nIan Harvie: No, I know, I-\n\nJorja Fox: No, I've been very lucky. I've gotten to play some very, very smart women. Which is a stretch for me.\n\nIan Harvie: Which is fantastic.\n\nJorja Fox: And, yeah, and I mean - Sara Sidle studied nuclear physics and fusion at Harvard and Berkley. And that was really excited, I was really proud of that.\n\nIan Harvie: I was really intimidated having you on the show because of all that.\n\nJorja Fox: Really? It's not me, though!\n\nIan Harvie: Do you remember any of your lines from that? Cause it's always really hot. The stuff that you say is totally-\n\nJorja Fox: Embarrassed Thanks, aw, thank you. Phenoethylene terephtalete.\n\nIan Harvie: Yeah, what the hell is that?\n\nJorja Fox: laughing Yeah.\n\nIan Harvie: I'm going to make myself wait till later -\n\nJorja Fox: Mass Spectrometer.\n\nIan Harvie: - wait till later, yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: laughing \n\nIan Harvie: Do you have any idea what that means?\n\nJorja Fox: Phenoethylene terephtalete? Not anymore. No. That's the problem. Like the short term memory. You learn it for the day and then you have no idea what you said the day before.\n\nIan Harvie: Do they tell you what it is you're saying, or...\n\nJorja Fox: At the time, yes.\n\nIan Harvie: So \"This is what it means.'\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, and that one was so hard I had to practice it for about four days. Cause you want it to, try and sort of roll off the tongue, so I'll never forget the word, and I have \"no\" idea what it means.\n\nIan Harvie: Okay. What was the storyline? Why did you leave? You were IL, you were in love with somebody, or you-\n\nJorja Fox: I did. I had a smokin' hot boyfriend on the show, and we got engaged. And then I dumped him, I gave him a Dear John letter and I just took off in the middle of the night. And essentially, for the character, it was she had this stressful experience, the serial killer took her out to the desert and almost killed her and ... She'd had it, really, with the death.\n\nIan Harvie: Does that stuff ever feel real to you?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, it's, you know, we try to make it as fun as we can. The unfortunate thing is that many of our stories are based on real ... stories. So, when you get the script and it's somebody's life, yeah, I think it affects you a little more. You know it's make believe that you're shooting it, but it really happened to someone.\n\nIan Harvie: But - And you were on \"ER\" and it's the same kind of lingo. As far as-\n\nJorja Fox: Depressing. Totally depressing.\n\nIan Harvie: Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: laughing At least sometimes they lived! Every once in a while on \"ER\" you'd cure them. Which is good for them. But it was really high stakes, high stress.\n\nIan Harvie: I can't remember how long you were on that for.\n\nJorja Fox: Three years. Yeah, I had a little run and then it was \"West Wing\" in there, and then \"CSI\" for the last seven and a half years.\n\nIan Harvie: That's right, \"West Wing\". Another easy one, another easy show.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. Another violent. laughing My role anyway. The show wasn't violent, my role was. I was a part of this plot, this racist plot to assassinate the president. And so my role was really violent. laughing My part of the show.\n\nIan Harvie: So, and \"Memento\", you were in \"Memento\". \n\nJorja Fox: Violent, pretty gross.\n\nIan Harvie: Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: Pretty gross shit.\n\nIan Harvie: Who's your fucking agent!? I mean, it's like \"I think this would be really good for you.'\n\nJorja Fox: laughing Yeah. Well it's been amazing. I feel so blessed. I think I'm one of the luckiest people in the world, really. And it's not that I'll never do violent stuff again, I'm sure I will. Violence is great drama. Just for a minute, I just kind of needed to get off. You know? Just take a little break.\n\nIan Harvie: Right. Now-\n\nJorja Fox: I'm taking sailing lessons.\n\nIan Harvie: Are you really?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, I'm learning how to play the drums. Finally. \n\nIan Harvie: Awesome!\n\nJorja Fox: Years later. That whole rumor that I play drums is not true.\n\nIan Harvie: The rumor that you play guitar is true, though.\n\nJorja Fox: That one is true. Yeah, badly. laughing Yeah, a couple people [in the audience] have seen me.\n\nIan Harvie: Why do you say badly?\n\nJorja Fox: Bad guitar? I just really, I never really, I don't really have any musical talent. I'm persistent and laughing I practice a lot, but I have no ear. At all.\n\nIan Harvie: Where are you playing the drums? Where can we see you rock it out?\n\nJorja Fox: Nowhere yet, thank god.\n\nIan Harvie: Any bands? Any garage bands?\n\nJorja Fox: No. I'm just taking classes. So right now it's percussion classes. I bring my African drum and we go and we kind of do stuff. And then, hopefully, that class is about eight weeks, and then I'll move to the kit class. Hopefully.\n\nIan Harvie: The what- Oh the kit!\n\nJorja Fox: The drum kit.\n\nIan Harvie: The kit. That's what it is, right.\n\nJorja Fox: Kind of musician talk.\n\nIan Harvie: The lingo. \"I'm gonna move to the drum kit.\" Yeah, that's awesome.\n\nJorja Fox: Wish me luck!\n\nIan Harvie: What was it - you said? Sailing! Where at? Where are you sailing at?\n\nJorja Fox: There's sailing classes you can take down at Marina Del Rey.\n\nIan Harvie: Are they teaching you in like those little Sunfish boats? With the one little sail and the scoop out - \n\nJorja Fox: Yeah and you have to wear those plastic floatie things. On your arms. It's in the bathtub, actually, at the YWCA.\n\nIan Harvie: What are those things called? Wings. They're called wings. No, seriously, are they in that kind of little boat, or-\n\nJorja Fox: It's a decent sized boat, you know what I mean. Like they'll take - I don't know how many people they have - the class. Our class has like 12 people in it.\n\nIan Harvie: Okay, so you're all on the boat.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, most of the time. I mean there's parts there where you have to learn - you learn the lingo. You know and like nautical. Words like that.\n\nIan Harvie: Right. Tacking. Tack. Tacking. Which means fucking duck. It means f-ing duck. That's really all you need to know on that one, right?\n\nJorja Fox: laughter\n\n&#8212;-\n\nJorja Fox: I was born in New York City and then they moved to Florida. My mom had the dream, she wanted to live in the small beach town. She had that dream her whole life. And three years after I was born, they made it happen. So they moved down -\n\nIan Harvie: Oh cool.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. They moved down there. And I moved back when I was 16.\n\nIan Harvie: You when to high school there.\n\nJorja Fox: I finished high school in New York.\n\nIan Harvie: Yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: I actually did finish.\n\nIan Harvie: What was your first acting &#8212; You did finish?\n\nJorja Fox: It was a close one.\n\nIan Harvie: You did?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. I have even a real diploma. It's not even a GED. I almost had a GED and then I-\n\nIan Harvie: And you didn't get it off the Internet cause they didn't have the Internet back then.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, no. Nothing. There was nothing, no gadgets at all.\n\nIan Harvie: The interwebs. What was your first acting thing? What is high school or something after?\n\nJorja Fox: High school was first. Actually, I wanted to be an actor since I was very little, and my mom found \"one\" acting class, you know, in like an hour of where we grew up. I was five years old, and I was really excited. And the deal with the acting class is that in order to take it, you also have to take the modeling classes. And I didn't really - I wasn't really interested in modeling at all, but I really wanted to act. So I took the classes for a while, and, um, I got a job. The first job I got, we were going to do a play at the mall, \"Chicken Little.\"\n\nIan Harvie: Uh huh.\n\nJorja Fox: In Florida. And I practiced really hard and I got the role of the Rooster.\n\nIan Harvie: Oh, awesome.\n\nJorja Fox: And, uh, laughing I was awesome until I did my first thing as the Rooster, and everybody laughed really, really, really, really, really hard. \n\nIan Harvie: Do you remember the line? Do you remember any lines?\n\nJorja Fox: It was like a crows like a rooster. Something like that.\n\nAudience cracks up ... Ian cracks up .. Jorja cracks up\n\nJorja Fox: And I quit! I was so mortified, really. Everyone was laughing at me. looks at the audience, mock accusing them of the same.\n\nIan Harvie: That's awful.\n\nJorja Fox: I didn't act again until high school. There was finally a drama department in high school. And oddly enough, I moved to new York for my modeling career. But it was only because that was my ticket out of Florida. Like that was the way I could go to New York. So once again I had to model to try to be an actor.\n\nIan Harvie: Did you do some of that?\n\nJorja Fox: A little bit. Yeah. It was great, actually, at that age. Cause you know, 17, 18. I got to travel a lot, I lived in Europe. I was a \"terrible\" model. I mean, I never really enjoyed it, I wasn't good at it. But I made some money, and I was able to take acting classes for a couple years.\n\nIan Harvie: And do what you wanted.\n\nJorja Fox: Drink cappuccino.\n\nIan Harvie: Yeah. Be very romantic.\n\nJorja Fox: We were all 19. Yeah, smoking, the cappuccino, talking about Mamet and stuff. It was really cool. \n\nIan Harvie: Where were you?\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, mostly Italy.\n\nIan Harvie: Cool.\n\nJorja Fox: Brooding, it was a brooding time of my life.\n\nIan Harvie: What are your -\n\nJorja Fox: Not much has changed.\n\nIan Harvie: You had your journal open.\n\nJorja Fox: Oh yeah. I still have my journal. I've got it with me.\n\nIan Harvie: What's your passion right now? What do you-\n\nJorja Fox: You know what I fuckin really hate?\n\nIan Harvie: What? Bring it, sister! Wha'd'ya got?\n\nJorja Fox: I fuckin' hate the people in the \"left\" lane of the freeway so fucking much that won't move over! Like when you're trying to pass them. I really think there should be a law and people should get tickets for that shit. It's just - It's rude, it's selfish. I mean- okay, maybe you mean something a little different.\n\nIan Harvie: No, no that was perfect. Are you thinking about a 501(c)(3)? Sort of a non-profit route?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, you know I would love to - yeah for that? Yeah. I'm accepting donations!\n\nIan Harvie: Now, actually, are you a vegetarian?\n\nJorja Fox: I am a vegetarian.\n\nIan Harvie: You are?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. The environment's a really big-big thing for me.\n\nIan Harvie: So, if you were going to, like, swing me over the fence to be a vegetarian, what would you tell me? Like what - three things - \n\nJorja Fox: I, uh, try not to proselytize.\n\nIan Harvie: Okay.\n\nJorja Fox: But...\n\nIan Harvie: Like three things that I would need to know.\n\nJorja Fox: Okay. Well, cows ... produce more methane from farting than any substance on the planet. So a big part of global warming is actually cows in fields -- it's true! -- sending up a lot of really noxious fumes.\n\nIan Harvie: And because of our demand for meat.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, they're everywhere. And it's also a huge reason for deforestation and a big reason for - you know like the spinach thing last year. Where a lot of people ate organic spinach and they got really sick, was because cow was getting into crops. You know that stuff goes down rivers and streams and it pollutes waterways. I've always been kinda of like &#8212; we all do what we can do.\n\nIan Harvie: I think one of the things that's hardest is the cooking part of it. Like I'm so ingrained: I have meat, I have starch. How do you change that thinking? It's so hard.\n\nJorja Fox: It's not easy. I'm French-Irish and all we ate was meat and potatoes. So it's really all we ate. When I became a vegetarian - I've been a vegetarian for like 20 years, and the first two years all I did was eat cheese and eggs cause I really didn't know what else to eat. I was extremely confused. For like every meal.\n\nIan Harvie: So, like, eggs are cool with you?\n\nJorja Fox: You know, I don't eat that much, but I eat them. It's a very personal choice. But, yeah, the cooking thing is hard. I think that in, like, LA or New York &#8212; If I was in the Arctic Tundra and it was like me an a seal? And I was really hungry? Maybe, you know, I would make the choice to survive. But if I'm living in LA? I mean, there's right next door there's Damiano's. You can get, like, a slice of soy cheese pizza with veggie \"pepperoni'. It's easy. It's pretty easy.\n\nIan Harvie: That's good pizza over there. You have something going on that you're -\n\nJorja Fox: I do.\n\nIan Harvie: That you're excited about. Tell me about it.\n\nJorja Fox: I'm really excited about it. Kirsten Holly Smith, who's a really old friend of mine, is here tonight and we're doing a play. I'm producing, she is staring in it. Uh. A show about Dusty Springfield. It's a music. crowd cheers Yeah! And the story is way overdue to be told. She had an amazing, incredible life. Pretty much a 30 year career span, over in Europe and the United States. And we're doing this show, it opens February 7th, in Los Angeles, at the Gay and Lesbian Center, the Tomlin and Wagner Theater. Kirsten's myspace page or my website will have it posted in a week or two.\n\nIan Harvie: Your website is?\n\nJorja Fox: Jorjafox.org\n\nIan Harvie: Okay, .org.\n\nJorja Fox: Mmm hmm. And that's filled with political ramblings of all kinds. It's my myspace page.\n\nIan Harvie: And give us a couple sentences background about her life. About Dusty's life.\n\nJorja Fox: Well, Dusty's pretty -- She really came on the music scene in the early '60s. She was one of the very first women that produced her own music and her own sound. She was one of the very first performers to stand up against Apartheid. In honor of Martin Luther King Day, today, thank you very much for that. She was also one of the first artists to come out as bisexual and lesbian. Like way before David Bowie and all those guys. So she's a very brave lady. She dealt with substance abuse and breast cancer. We're going to tell some of that in the story, it's almost -- it's kind of too rich a life to tell it all in 90 minutes.\n\nIan Harvie: Right.\n\nJorja Fox: We'll also perform, I think, 10? Dusty Springfield songs. Or 11. And the band's amazing, the story's amazing, Kirsten's amazing. You'll get to see her in a second.\n\nIan Harvie: Alright. Fantastic. There is one question that I'm sure is on everybody's mind here. That everybody's probably wanted to ask you, and I don't know if anybody's ever asked you this before.\n\nJorja Fox: Really?\n\nIan Harvie: And I know it's kinda one of those things that maybe, you know, that in this sort of atmosphere I could probably ask it, and it would be okay. I guess I just want to ask, what was it like to film that After School Special back in 93?\n\nIan Harvie: Was it 93? I'm sorry, what year was that?\n\nJorja Fox: Gaaaaahd. You know- I can't believe you asked me that. No comment. I don't talk about that.\n\nIan Harvie: Fair enough, fair enough.\n\nJorja Fox: Cool. Alright, cool.\n\nIan Harvie: Fair enough. Jorja Fox, everybody! Thank you so much.  ",

        "content": "\nInterviewer: All right, we're gonna talk all about this play and everything Jorja related, but you, you made sort of a conscious decision - you know, you've been on this very successful show, and then, you left. What, what, what -- was that a real soul search, or was it \"gee, it's time\"?\n\nJorja Fox: Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah, very very much. It was harder to leave than it was to stay, for sure.\n\nInterviewer: Oh I'm sure.\n\nJorja Fox: And I will be, there will be a moment, I will return. \"(gasp from somebody off camera)\" I can't tell you when or why or how...\n\nInterviewer: Oh like in a box, or what's the first thing...\n\nJorja Fox: Uh, I can't tell you, very secretive...\n\nInterviewer: But in terms of that, and I think there are many people who weigh in on the discussion, working as a successful actress such as yourself, there's a, a manager or an agent somewhere, maybe an accountant, did they say \"Are you outta your mind\"?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. A lot. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I have been so incredibly blessed, I did eleven and a half straight years on prime time TV at night.\n\nInterviewer: Okay, yeah.\n\nJorja Fox: It's amazing, it's an amazing run, I feel so lucky and, and grateful for that, and I felt like, \"okay, here I am, I'm, I'm coming into, you know, very soon sort of the second half of my life\", and I just wanted to take a breath for a minute and, and think for a minute, \"what would that look like?\n\nJorja Fox: What does that look like?\". It might really look like nighttime TV drama-\n\nInterviewer: Right.\n\nJorja Fox: -but I needed to just get off the ride for a second to evaluate it and regroup, and the violence, I needed a break-\n\nInterviewer: I was gonna, I was gonna do a little projection, you almost answered the question for me. The show's very good, but it's very grim,\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\nInterviewer: incredibly dark.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, very dark.\n\nInterviewer: Do you think if you were kinda working on a happy sit-com, you might've had a different thought?\n\nJorja Fox: It's possible... I really never had the, I've never been able to work on a, I'd love to check out a sit-com, see what that's like. I did one comedy many many years ago, and it was single-handedly probably the most fun I've ever had doing a movie. And it's just because the goal of the day really is to laugh, and hopefully everyone will laugh, and yes, I'd love to exper-, I'd love to, I'd love to let you know. \"(comment of \"Uh-huh\" from off camera, Jorja laughs)\"\n\nInterviewer: Well something that's obviously very gratifying to you, it's a theater company called HoneyPot Productions, and, uh, tell us about this whole thing.\n\nJorja Fox: Well, it's a, it's a life and music of Dusty Springfield, going up at the Renberg Theater in Los Angeles for \"definitely\" three weeks, and uh, we do about thirteen Dusty songs in the musical. She had an amazing, interesting, colorful life and a very amazing, interesting times. Uh, her career kinda started in the early Sixties, ran almost to the late Nineties, she felt, you know she was up, she was down, she dealt with substance abuse, she was one of the first women in the business that was producing her own music, she had a, a, just a really dynamic life. So if you \"like\" her music you will love the show, and you'll get to learn the-\n\noff camera voice: But you're not Dusty Springfield.\n\nJorja Fox: No, I so wish I was- \"(laughs)\"\n\nother anchor: What do you play?\n\nJorja Fox: -I've, I've no talent for singing or dancing, in any capacity. So I am simply producing-\n\nother anchor: Oh, so you're not even-\n\nJorja Fox: -I'm one of three producers. So, uh, Johnny Prado is our head producer with Leslie Brockett, and uh-\n\nInterviewer: We're gonna look at a clip in a second of the woman who does play Dusty-\n\nJorja Fox: Yes. Kirsten Holly Smith, she's breathtaking. And really,\n\nInterviewer: So you and the other producers are involved in that casting, did you think not with envy, but \"gosh I wish I could do this\"?\n\nJorja Fox: Oh I so wish. One of my dreams in my life actually is to be a rock star. And Kirsten also wrote this script, uh, with a little additional material by Patricia Cotters. So,\n\nInterviewer: Here is a little bit of the play that Jorja is, uh, behind the scenes on and wants to encourage you to see, so watch this.\n\n\"(clip from \"Stay Forever\")\"\n\nInterviewer: Gosh, she really, she obviously, does that take you back to your bedroom playing your brother's 45s?\n\nJorja Fox: Yes. My brother's twelve years older than me, and uh, when he went off to college he left me his 45 collection. So I was \"very\" acquainted with the music of the Sixties at a young age. Uh, it wasn't-\n\nInterviewer: Did you have a Close And, did you have a Close And Play?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah.\n\noff camera voice: Close And Play, I remember those.\n\nJorja Fox: I had many dance parties-\n\noff camera voice: Nice.\n\nJorja Fox: -for a few years.\n\nInterviewer: Okay.\n\nInterviewer 2: Was it more important for you in casting, uh, for Dusty's role that the person \"sound\" or \"look\" like her? I mean...\n\nJorja Fox: I think the sound is, is, is really quite an quintessential. This show is \"really\" about the music of Dusty, so that, that would've, that was the single-handed, most important thing, putting it together. Kirsten Holly Smith not only plays Dusty in this piece, also wrote this piece, and it came out of a grant from USC. They did one night at USC, and, ah, we've taken it from there. There was interest, there were a couple of theaters interested, we sort of worked the script a little bit, and here it is, it's a first run, so...\n\nInterviewer: You can see \"Stay Forever\" at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center's Renberg Theater, it's February 7th through the 24th. Ticket information is on your screen at 323-860-3200. KTLA has got more information as well. It's really nice to see you Jorja, come back.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you so much, guys.\n\nInterviewer: It was a pleasure...\n\nJorja Fox: ... weekend in Los Angeles...\n\nInterviewer 2: Enjoy marinating too. I'm excited what you're not substituting.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you. Oh, yeah, I didn't even talk about that.\n\nInterviewer 2: Oooo... you gotta come back then.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, a couple later, yeah...  ",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox Wow, um. Thank you. I'm hearing that, people have been saying that. And that's amazing, I think- You know, the other reason that I thought the show was going to flop was because it was about science. And I thought that was going to be a very hard thing to make to look fascinating and interesting and exciting to people. I thought it was very fascinating, like reading the script I had a tremendous amount of faith in the show and I just had no idea how we would pull it off. So if people responded in that kind of way where they actually maybe kind of might be more interested in science than they were, that's a pretty cool thing. And science is great because it's evolving every day, as well as technology and a lot of the computer stuff- A lot of the stuff we get to do on the show is groundbreaking technology and it's going to continue to do that over the next maybe five to ten years, so it's a great time to be telling these stories. There's never an ending amount of new ideas and it's probably a really good time for people to get into the field. It's going to be interesting to see how many people will stick around, cause, you know, there's certain things on TV that we can't really share with the audience. Like the smell! \"(laugh)\" Some of the more horrible aspects of doing the job. So I'm interested to see what happens. ",

        "content": "\nMichael Barnes: Hi, I'm Michael Barnes and I'm here with actress, Jorja Fox. Jorja has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: \"ER\", \"The West Wing\" and, most recently, \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\". Today we'll be playing excerpts of songs she selected that have inspired her over the years, as part of KCRW's Guest DJ Project.\n\nJorja Fox: Hi Michael. First of all, thank you so much for having me. I'm a big fan, I'm a little nervous. So what I finally did [for my song selections] is stick a little bit to a piano/keyboard theme. I kind of had to try and find something to sort of narrow it down. The first song I picked is \"Jet\", which was written by Paul McCartney and done by Paul McCartney and Wings. I was at the Coachella Music Festival -- Coachella '09 -- Paul McCartney headlined on Friday night, and I knew by the second verse of this first song that it was going to be one of the best concerts I had ever been to in my entire life. And he opened with \"Jet\", so I figured I would open with \"Jet\".\n\nJF: You know, obviously, I could talk about The Beatles probably for about two weeks straight and not even come up for air. It was very hard to pick one song. I grew up with The Beatles. My brother was 12 years older than me, and when he went to college my mom got him an eight track, so he left me all of his albums and his 45âs, and I scored this giant Beatles collection.\n\nMB: You just heard a sample from Paul McCartney and Wings. The song is \"Jet\", picked by Jorja Fox, who is our guest here for KCRW's Guest DJ Project. What do you have next for us?\n\nJF: This is a song called \"The Story\", by the Matthew Herbert Big Band. Matthew Herbert has done a whole bunch of different genres of albums. I think this is his second compilation of big band music. I'm a subscriber to KCRW, a proud subscriber, and I got the winter CD you guys give out to all of us that give to the station, and on it was this song. The first time I heard it, I was in rapture, like from the first couple of notes of this song.\n\nJF: My father -- I'm gonna take you through a tour of my family I think at this point -- my father is 85 years old, he lives in sunny Florida, he served in World War II, he's a huge, huge, huge music lover. My mother never cared for music at all, as a matter of fact, she would often argue with him to turn it off. So my love of music comes from my dad and my brother. My dad grew up with big bands and jazz, so from a very, very early age, I was exposed to that [genre] -- it's kind of the only records he had. He still puts Brylcreem in his hair. And I feel really honored cuz growing up sort of in the seventies in a beach town in Florida, I would have never been exposed to big band and jazz if it hadn't been for my dad.\n\nMB: You just heard an excerpt from Matthew Herbert Big Band. The name of the song is \"The Story\" from the most recent record, There's Me and There's You. And that was something that was picked by actress, Jorja Fox, who you may know from ER and The West Wing and, most recently, from CSI as Dr. Sara Sidle.\n\nJF: Oh, Doctor, I love that -- scientist, technically.\n\nMB: Scientist, okay.\n\nJF: But yeah, kind of doctor, and a lot of people think cop. But I guess technically we were always scientists. We worked for the cops, but we weren't technically cops.\n\nMB: There you go.\n\nJF: Obscure fact, yeah.\n\nMB: So what do you have next for us, Jorja?\n\nJF: Well, this is where I start to get a little crafty. Again, because it was so hard to pick five songs, I started to find songs that I loved that were covered by artists that I love, in an effort to talk about more songs and more artists. My favorite band right now is a band called Hot Chip. I love them -- they're so danceable, they're listenable, they're fun. I love their lyrics. [This is] one of the newer songs they have out that I'm familiar with, I think was released in February of '09. [It] is a cover of Joy Division's \"Transmission\", which is on a great compilation album called War Child: Heroes, Volume 1. And what I had heard about it, which I think is so interesting, is the bands that were covered, actually picked the artist to cover their songs. So it's my understanding that the New Order guys picked Hot Chip to do a Joy Division cover. I love Joy Division, I love New Order, I love Hot Chip -- here's \"Transmission\".\n\nJF: I was lucky enough to grow up with this college radio station in Florida called WFIT. It's a small, small, small, small town where I came from -- like one street with an ice cream parlor and that's about it. And we had this radio station -- we sort of had a window to the entire world.\n\nMB: Music from Hot Chip. \"Transmission\" is the name of the song, originally done by Joy Division and featured on War Child: Heroes, Volume 1 collection, picked by our guest here at KCRW, actress Jorja Fox. What do you have next for us?\n\nJF: Ugh, next. Again growing up in Florida it was really sort of heavy rock alternative music time. And when I finally got to New York, I finally made some friends who were kind of my own age and they were listening to Joni Mitchell who, I think, is one of the better song writers that ever was and guitarist and pianist. This particular track is \"Black Crow\", and it's preformed and arranged by Diana Krall, who's one of my favorite contemporary jazz pianist artists right now. It's a song about traveling. It's a song about being on the road. But when I listen to it, I really feel like I'm flying.\n\nMB: \"Black Crow\", by Joni Mitchell covered by Diana Krall.\n\nJF: I love music. I actually took up the drums about a year and a half ago. I'm a very late beginner. In CSI, as a mater of fact, we had a lunch time band for the longest time. There are so many people that play music on CSI. And lunch is only a half hour and people would run to the food truck, like just run, and get the food and throw it in the trailers and then go into the stage and we'd just leave our instruments there and we'd have jams for as long, you know, until they'd call us back to work and then you just eat your lunch cold throughout the day when you had time, you know?\n\nMB: You just heard a sample of Diana Krall doing Joni Mitchell's \"Black Crow\", you can find that on her album The Girl in the Other Room and that was selected by our guest here in the studios, actress Jorja Fox. So what do you have next for us?\n\nJF: \"So Danco Samba\", written of course by Getz and Gilberto. This particular version of it is my favorite. It's performed by Ella Fitzgerald and I was in Costa Rica last spring, I surf and I'd been surfing all day in Costa Rica, and I get out of the water with my surfboard and I go down this tiny little hotel that had 20 tables set up in the sand on the beach, huge palm trees hanging over head, like 40-foot palm trees. And there is this gentleman, who is from Brazil. He's a one man band: he's got his drums, his percussion, his keyboard, his guitars. And what he does is he lays down a riff and it records itself so he can lay down the drums of what he wants to do, and then his keyboard sound. Then, he'll put in a little guitar -- it's recorded as he's doing it right there. And I got to just sit there and watch the sun go down listening to this amazing musician. And he did a lot of Bossa Nova that night and my favorite moment was \"So Danco Samba.\"\n\nMB: \"So Danco Samba\" by Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nMB: You just heard a selection of some master works from Ella Fitzgerald doing a song by Joao Gilberto. \"So Danco Samba\" is the name of the song. And that was something that was picked by our guest here in our studio, actress Jorja Fox. Thank you so much for joining us here at KCRW.com for the Guest DJ Project.\n\nJF: It was great, good luck with this project, it was so fun!\n\nMB: For complete track listing and to find these songs online go to KCRW.com/GuestDJProject.\n\nTracks\n\nPaul McCartney and Wings: Jet  \nThe Matthew Herbert Big Band: The Story  \nHot Chip: Transmission  \nDiana Krall: Black Crow  \nElla Fitzgerald: So Danco Samba (Jazz Samba)",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nReporter: ... tell us about puppy mills?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, probably a lot of things. I think that puppy mills - it's a very easy issue. You know, if people were more aware, if they knew more, it would be a given issue. Just because we used to put asbestos in our walls, and we used to put lead in our paint, and it was a great idea at the time, doesn't mean it's still a great idea. Puppy mills are places where, all they do, month after month, year after year, is breed dogs to sell to pet stores. And most of these dogs are kept in very, very cramped cages their entire lives, they never see the sun, they usually have diseases, they have one job that they do. And, of course, because they're dogs, they do it really well. I mean dogs, I think we all know, love humans and love to make humans happy and will do whatever it takes to please the person that they're living with. The conditions are awful. As soon as dogs aren't valuable anymore, they're put down, often they end up at the bottom of lakes. I mean it's really a sad, tragic story.\n\nReporter: How- \"why\" are you such an animal advocate?\n\nJorja Fox: I wish I could put that into logical terms. I've always been an animal lover. I grew up in a very small town. I grew up on the ocean. The people that live in the small town were very - the environment was necessary for everybody's survival, it was a fishing town and it was a tourist town. So it was very important, even in the early 70s when I was growing up, that if we didn't care for the place that we lived in, everybody's job would go away. So that's connection number 1, that we were all connected. Similarly, I think more than ever, now the wild places on earth are getting smaller and smaller and I think that it's all time for us to have a little bit more compassion and to protect those places. Not only because animals are really cool and funny and beautiful and gorgeous and magical, but because if we don't protect those spaces, we're not going to have a space either. We don't survive if they're not surviving.",

Ladies and gentlemen, Jorja Fox right now on the Kevin and Bean show.\n\nJorja: Aw, thank you!\n\nHost: More importantly, Sara Sidle returns tonight. That's what I care about.\n\nHost 2: Yes! Yes yes yes.!\n\nJorja: Thank you so much!\n\nHost: What your character has been put through in the course of this series, Jorja-\n\nJorja: My goodness gracious! Right?\n\nHost: -- is been ridiculous!\n\nJorja: Yeah, I would have to agree. But happily so. It's been so much fun to do all that stuff.\n\nHost: Great stuff to play, I'm sure.\n\nJorja: There was one episode alone where I felt like the writers were trying to kill me. Just about every way that you could try to kill somebody on this show.\n\nHost: They crushed you with a car, I remember that.\n\nJorja: Yeah! There was under the car, there was getting thrown out of the car, there was a fistfight, there was walking through the desert. You know, pretty much, yeah! The whole episode.\n\nHost: And then they sent you off to Costa Rica. And now you're back.\n\nJorja: Yeah, that's where we've last seen Sara. That was a big moment, cause there Billy and I were, under the sort of like, the Costa Rican canopy, and it was-\n\nHost: By Billy you mean William Petersen?\n\nJorja: William Petersen, of course, yes. He plays Grissom.\n\nHost 2: I'm gonna start calling him Billy! I like that!\n\nJorja: Only it may be a little overly familiar! But I thought \"Well, this might be it!\" You know, \"This might be the end of Sara's chapter, it might be the last time I'm here.\" So I was very surprised to get a call this summer.\n\nHost: And that time, you came back cause Warrick got shot. Right? That was the circumstance?\n\nJorja: Yeah, well that was, you know, that's still something that's sort of a touchy subject. I wish that Warrick was alive out there, somewhere. But. Warrick was murdered, before the last scene where Billy goes to Costa Rica. So the last time we see -- \n\nHost 2: Oh! that's right that's right!\n\nJorja: -- William Petersen and Sara Sidle, is in a Costa Rican rainforest.\n\nHost 2: My timeline was off.\n\nHost: Well, you know, Jorja, time travel is very big on TV these days. Isn't it possible that you guys could go back to just before he was shot and stop it? Save him? Put him back on the show?\n\nJorja: I- You know, I've been pitching a prequel for years! It gets harder and harder. We're starting our tenth season, so to try and do a prequel means people have to de-age us by a decade. And that's pretty challenging at this point.\n\nHost 2: Piece of cake! Piece of cake.\n\nJorja: Maybe the animated prequel.\n\nHost 2: Exactly.\n\nHost: Before we get caught up and talk about what happens tonight, and the return of season 10, thereâs no way anyone, in the beginning, thought that CSI would turn into one of the biggest hits in the history of television. When you guys started, I mean, this was something new on network television. Your show came out, doing stuff different. But nobody expected the juggernaut that it became, right?\n\nJorja: I thought a show about death, on a Friday night, was gonna be a gigantic clunker. Really, terrible, horrible, clunker. But the story was so intriguing to me, I sort of fell under a trance from the moment I read the script. I was like \"Alright, well I have to do this!\"\n\nHost 2: I think, people take it for granted now, but at the time we had never seen anything like it before on television.\n\nJorja: Thank you. Well, there was Quincy! That goes back a ways...\n\nHost 2: [Laughs] This is far stretch from Quincy. Forensics have come a long way since Quincy.\n\nJorja: [Laughs] Yes. And they're still coming a long way which, I think, is an advantage that we have. New technology is coming out every month, and we can use it.\n\nHost: I remember in the early episodes, where they would follow the path of a bullet into the body, and show you all the damage it does. And your head would explode! You'd never seen anything like it, even in a movie, let alone on television! And then, you thought initially, week to week, solving cases, we've seen this done on tons of procedural cop shows, and that kind of stuff.\n\nJorja: Yeah, it's one of the standard. The old standards.\n\nHost: But the character development in CSI is what I feel really set it apart. How we got so attached to your characters and followed them through all these different permutations over the years.\n\nJorja: Like an old suit, from the 70s, slowly but surely-\n\nHost: But you find twenty bucks pockets! Now you must have, in the course of research or just interaction with experts that come by to advice on the show, you must have dealt with a lot of real life C.S.I. people over the years. Who are the people that go into this field, that love this kind of work? What drives them?\n\nJorja: It's a very diverse group. I think that there's a couple things they have to have. They have to have almost like an OCD type of focus, and a patience and a persistence. And I think they've got to be very, very, committed to crime fighting. And we still, every day, we have a tech advisor on our set, every day, still trying to help us look as realistic as possible. There's real crime scene investigators in the writers room almost every day. We have personal relationships with a lot of those guys, both from -- The cool thing about our show because we shoot in LA but we take place in Vegas is that we can -- if it's real in either one of those cities, we can put it on air. So we have people from both cities giving us stories and advice.\n\nHost: Oh I see! Are there are lot of women that go into the field? And are there more women going into the field now because of you? And because of Catherine's character?\n\nJorja: Well that's very kind of you. They tell us that that's true. That yes, there are a lot of women going into the field. One of our first advisors, Liz Devine, was in Los Angeles, a very early sort of woman in the field, and she was blonde and well endowed in all the right places. Sort of faced that textbook stuff you hear about when women enter fields that they're not traditionally in. More and more so, I think women, if I'm going to get stereotypical, I think women are really, really geared towards the field because of that patience and that persistence.\n\nHost: But they're not really smart enough though, right?\n\nJorja: They're very good at detail oriented work, where you're on hour eleven and you're still holding your focus.\n\nHost: Really it's just puzzle solving more than anything else.\n\nJorja: Yeah, great big puzzle.\n\nHost: Let me ask you one more question before the break. Jorja Fox is here and will tell you all about the premiere of season ten of CSI. But here's the question I have to ask, is it true that because of the success of CSI, it is harder now to impress a jury? Or harder to -- in many cases a jury will think that they real life is like the television show, and it makes it harder for prosecutors sometimes, when they don't have the slam dunk, scientific evidence that you often come up with on your show. Have you heard that?\n\nJorja: What we hear, actually, is the opposite. We hear it's a lot harder for cops. For instance, I get my car broken into, and a police officer arrives, and I want the crime solved in, like, 48-hours, and I want him to pull out his DNA kit, fingerprinting and stuff. I think, originally, in courtrooms, it made it a little easier, because these guys were pitching this kind of science, for a while, but juries weren't quite grasping it. Now they have a really good understanding of what all of it means.\n\nHost: Ballistics, GSR, latent GSR! GSR all over his hands!\n\nHost: Laypeople -- We amateurs know so much more about police work and science of the C.S.I. than we ever would have thought possible, because you found a way to make it entertaining.\n\nJorja: Thank you.\n\nHost: CSI returns tonight at 9. A quick break! More with Jorja Fox, if she doesn't give us all the Swine Flu, when we return, right after this on the Kevin and Bean Show!\n\n[...]\n\nHost: Jorja Fox is in our studio. The return of CSI, season 10, tonight at 9 on CBS. Now because you're the big dog on the television schedule, every year the other networks try to figure out \"How are we going to take CSI down.\" \"What are we going to do this year to take CSI down?\" You have been up against every show in the history of television.\n\nJorja: True! Yeah, and we're up against a pretty good one right now, who's name I can't mention on the air. But you guys have been promoting it several times this morning.\n\nLisa (co-host): Oops! \n\nHost: We're not responsible for commercials.\n\nJorja: Yeah, little medical drama.\n\nHost: Don't hold it against us! -- OH! That one! Oh that show SUCKS! It's all CSI! It's way CSI!\n\nJorja: Aww! Thank you!\n\nHost: You're either gay or Lisa if you're gonna watch that show.\n\nLisa: It's just a chick show, yeah.\n\nHost: So Sara returns tonight. Do we find out the state of her relationship with Grissom, while they've been away? Do we look into that at all this evening?\n\nJorja: In about 12 short hours, in Los Angeles, you will. I think you'll get at least a sort of an establishing amount of information that I was very pleased with.\n\nHost: We've all been curious what's been going on after that kiss in Costa Rica.\n\nJorja: I think we were in Costa Rica for a nice long time. That's all I can say at the moment.\n\nLisa: Got a lot accomplished, did you?\n\nHost: How used to seeing Sara can we get, as fans of the show? You gonna be around for a while, or is this another hit and run? You gonna tease us and run off again? Another foreign country you gonna run off to?\n\nJorja: I know, right? I keep having these really big, dramatic, goodbyes, and then -- It's like \"Oh, gosh! It's her again!\" I think you can't pull that off that much before -- I mean people are already rolling their eyes at me. They've done that for years. That will continue, I think, if I keep saying \"I'm back! Goodbye!\" \"Hey, I'm back! Goodbye!\"\n\nHost: \"But this time I mean it!\"\n\nJorja: \"Send me flowers!\" No, I'm visiting, and I'm thrilled to do so. As I said, I wasn't expecting it at all, especially after the Costa Rican episode. SO we'll see! We're taking it one day at a time. It's so much fun, it's like going home in some respects. In some respects it's like having a brand new job and being somewhere for the first time. I have so much love and devotion in my heart for everybody there.\n\nHost: How's Laurence Flishburn- Fishburne to work with.\n\nJorja: Laurence Flishburn?\n\n[Everyone laughs]\n\nHost: Laurence Flishburn.\n\nJorja: Notable actor?\n\nHost: Yeah. I've started drinking already. Laurence Fishburne, one of my favorite actors, and he's so good on the show.\n\nJorja: He is! He's spectacular.\n\nHost: How exciting is it to work with that stature when you come back to a project like CSI?\n\nJorja: Very humbly. You know, Liev Schrieber guest stared a couple seasons ago too, and he and Fishburne would be two of my all time favorite actors. It's just kind of weird that all of the sudden they're sort of like at your house. You know? Like they knock on the door and you're like 'Hey, come on in! Would you like a cup of coffee?' or something. He's amazing. He's as kind and benevolent and generous and sweet and funny as you could ever imagine that he might be.\n\nHost: There's where you've got smart guys and gals running the show. Because when you lose your star, when you lose Mr. Grissom's character, when you lose that you need a guy with -- not only a great actor, but with gravitas. Who can come in and pick up the slack. And he has that. He's one of those guys, you can't take your eyes off the screen.\n\nJorja: Mesmerizing. And he's sicker than I am and he's in New York doing the press, so you've gotta give him credit for that.\n\nHost: He's spreading the virus on that coast.\n\nJorja: We all have the CSI bug, it's very contagious.\n\nHost: What did you do, when you left the show, about the show? Did you continue to watch it as a fan, or did you not want to see your boyfriend move on with another woman?\n\nJorja: Yeah! That was scary! And that happened a little bit. Sort of. They left that very ambiguous, thank God. I watched for a while and then I realized, \"I'm on sabbatical. I'm taking a year off.\" And then I kind of turned off my TV. So for the most part there was very little that I watched, including CSI, in that year. I did a bunch of traveling.\n\nHost: Wow! That's a surprise.\n\nJorja: I thought, if I'm really gonna take a year off, as long as my heads in the game, if I'm watching TV every night. But, when they called this summer, I had them TIVO'd, most of them, and I did sit down at watch a lot of them. I still have a couple left to watch. I've worked my way up to the season finale of last year, it's the one episode I haven't see yet. Which is weird, because we're premiering tonight, so I've probably have to go home and watch it today! I have to watch it this afternoon! And I thought last season was amazing, I thought they did a really great job. It's really difficult to lose three characters in the space of a year or so. The writers are brilliant. I thought they handled very well, and I thought that -- there hasn't been a ton of subtext on CSI the last year. Everybody's been grieving the loss of old people, and also hopeful of new folks coming in. I think that played on screen a lot.\n\nHost: And plus, you just want to see McDreamy happy. Right?\n\nLisa: Not the same show.\n\nJorja: I'm sorry, who are you? What radio show is this? Where am I?\n\nLisa: Big boy!\n\nHost: Here's a tweet question for you, Jorja. Eric wants to know if it's sometimes hard to act with all the special effects that they use on the show?\n\nJorja: Eric. To be honest with you, I rarely see the special effects. We're generally in a stage, we're in a room. We see more -- we see the stunts and the car wrecks and things like that. But a lot of the CSI stuff that they do comes in post-production, which is one of the reasons I actually really watch the show! Because so much of it happens in post. The music gets laid in post. We're really proud of our music, we've had a lot of really amazing bands come through. And I like to watch everybody else's work and see what they did.\n\nHost: Tonight at nine on CBS. For folks who are gonna try CSI for the first time, or haven't been paying as close attention as they should, what is the 30-second setup that you give people that are prepared to sit down and watch CSI?\n\nJorja: Uh ...\n\nHost: Ten years of work!\n\nHost: That's not saying recap every plot point!\n\nJorja: I gotta pitch it? I can say this. When I read the script this summer, I think, whenever you've been on as long as we have -- and we're ooooolllld now, I feel like we've got canes and walkers and all kinds of stuff ... Geritol. I read the script, I was excited I was coming back, and I was like, \"You know, this show's probably peaked. I'm sure it's gonna be a great script.\" I thought it's probably ... The best is in the past. And when I read the first page of the first scene, I was strapped into a seatbelt and I thought to myself \"Game. On.\"\n\nHost: Wow! That sounds great.\n\nLisa: I'm excited!\n\nHost: And I hope that Sara and Catherine will finally act on their long standing attraction to one another.\n\nJorja: That's been coming up a lot, actually!\n\nHost: I think it's about time for that wrinkle to be ... on CSI.\n\nJorja: Someone should get something on CSI!\n\nHost: Exactly! \n\nHost: Well, sweeps have got to be right around the corner. Let's not be crazy here.\n\nHost: Well, Jorja, so nice to finally meet you. We'll happily take the Swine Flu from you-\n\nJorja: Oh, great!\n\nHost: -just because you happen to be here today.\n\nJorja: Thank you so much for having me, I'm a huge fan. You guys have been so nice to me for such a long time, and it's really an honor to be here.\n\nHost: Thank you, Jorja. CSI tonight at 9 on CBS!",

I just wanted to thank you so very, very, very, very much for all being here today. I'm sure that, as Pat already said, you're in for something quite extraordinary. Very few people get to see something like this. It's magical. It's special. It's a good day to be a compassionate person. So. Four lions get on a fourteen hour flight from Bolivia to America. And one lion says to the other lion, \"Let us pray.\" And we did. There has been loads and loads of complications for so easy a task. The weight of this entire mission fell on Jan and Tim. And here they are. I also think &#8212; When I think about Memorial Day, for me, I think about bravery, I think about sacrifice, I think about freedom. And this is just a simple, small, thing. But it's very appropriate that these lions are being released today. In the spirit of the land of the free and the home of the brave, I will allow Pat to introduce to you, Bambek, Daktari, Simba and Camba. Thank you everybody.",

So how many hours have you been awake?\n\nJan Creamer: I think about 20 hours. Something like that. It's been a long journey.\n\nJorja: How are you feeling?\n\nJan: Everyone's doing really well, really very well. We were feeling really, really tired on the plane. Once we started getting near, the adrenaline took over. We got excited. And this one [lion] got really excited. He started moving around, and growling and roaring.\n\nJorja: No.\n\nJan: Yeah. It was kind of like they knew something was about to happen.\n\nJorja: I am completely exhilarated. I cannot believe this. And they're here, it happened, and they're doing very well. This [lion] is Bombet. It's a miracle.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja: Now the lions have a chance to have some water. They're talking to each other. They all know that they're here, safely on the ground. We're going to start boarding them up, getting them ready for the drive to PAWS Ark 2000, call Pat. She's going to go back to bed for a little while, and when we get closer, we're going to call her. And the lions will be delivered tonight. \n\n[...]\n\nJorja: May 28th, 2010, it's four o'Clock in the morning on this beautiful, beautiful Friday. The lions and most of the ADI team have just arrived here at Ark 2000 at PAWS. We're making arrangements now to get them into pens overnight. In the morning, they're going to meet some grass. It's amazing.\n\n[...]\n\nJorja: Well. All the lions have leaves in their fur, in their hair and their manes. You can see behind us all four are finally out. Camba [the lioness] decided to go first. We waited for a while for the boys, and she's out, she led them out. Everyone's pretty much over the moon as they explore this territory. Of course, we understand they're exhausted, because they played ferociously for hours after they got out of their pens in the morning. And they managed to save up a little more energy to walk around right behind us. \n\n[...]\n\nJorja: I'm completely ecstatic. Utterly delirious. I have joined the rest of the- The rest of the ADI team in lack of sleep. I think I'm running on two hours at this point. I definitely got more sleep than anyone else here. Pat might have to drag me off the property when it's time to go. I might just stay here forever.",

When they arrived at the airport, the replacement aircraft had not shown up. The first aircraft had a hydraulic failure, and so everyone got very nervous for a time, as to wether they were going to take off. The aircraft indeed did arrive, and I've just received news from Jan that thy stopped in Panama to refuel, and she sent some photos as well. Although she looks very, very exhausted.\n\nThe cats are doing great. They got some water and they're finally sleeping and relaxed. And we want to thank the country of Panama for being willing to let everyone stop over there briefly.

I'm here in San Francisco, working with the Animal Defenders International San Francisco team, and we've been on pins and needles waiting to get the go-ahead from Jan in Bolivia. I've just gotten off the phone with her, and it looks like all systems are a go. Mel, the vet, has checked the crates and has checked the lions &#8212; everyone's doing well. I think that we're going to start boarding in a few hours. The San Francisco team has been ready for several days. There's been a tremendous amount of patience, and of course there've been some last minute challenges. But. \n\nFrom the beginning of this whole adventure there's been a mountain of obstacles. It started with the volcano in Iceland. There was an airline strike in the UK. There was strikes in Bolivia &#8212; roadblocks went up, riots ensued. There's been just ginormous amounts of paper work that needed to get filled to get lions through two countries. Paperwork you would anticipant when you're moving large cats, but there's also been some human paperwork issues as well. Just tonight, getting off the phone with Jan, we found out that the aircraft is broken down. So now we're hoping, and we're wishing, like we've done almost every night about something, that the replacement aircraft arrives soon and the lions will, indeed, be in the air in several hours. \n\nIn the past weeks, the incredible habitat for the lions, at the Performing Animal Welfare Society Ark 2000 sanctuary, here in California, has been completed. The lions will have individual dens, feeding areas and, most importantly, will be able to roam in a large, natural, enclosure. ADI has paid for this enclosure, and will pay for the care of these animals for the rest of their lives. Remember when we first saw these lions, they were living in a rusting cage, of the back of a truck, with a traveling circus in Bolivia. In 48 hours, they will feel the grass beneath their feet for the first time ever. \n\nFor the past week, the ADI team in San Francisco has been working out of a hotel, completing the paperwork and getting ready for the move. Every day they get the video footage and photographs from Jan and the team in Bolivia, and edit it for online updates and for the media. Each day, the media teams in Bolivia and the USA are sending out news alerts in English and Spanish. ADI will need to care for these animals for the rest of their lives, and we hope that will be a long time. So we are launching an adoption scheme to raise money to care for the lions, and today our teams are hitting the streets of San Francisco, promoting the scheme.\n\nOut at San Francisco Airport, we have assessed the site where the lions will arrive, we will be unloading them, checking that they are okay, giving them a good, solid, drink of water, and then they'll be loaded onto the truck for the journey to their new home at Ark 2000.\n\nWell, I'll be back with another update tomorrow, when these amazing animals finally arrive. I can't wait. I know none of us are going to sleep a wink, and we'll see you tomorrow.",

        "content": "\nReturning to CSI in Season 10\n\nYou can't get rid of me. Everybody- I've had a couple of dramatic goodbyes here \\laughter\\ like pretty dramatic! And it's like oh, I'm gonna be- I'm probably going to be the last one standing. \"Oh her? She's saying goodbye again, whatever. She'll be back in a few weeks.\"\n\nIt is nice. You know, when I left I had cake in my mouth and I was crying. And I was looking at Carol and I was 'I'd love to visit! That would be super fun!' And I never expected that they'd actually call. So that they did is so flattering for me.\n\n Why Jorja Returned to CSI\n\nI got the script in July, Carol Mendelsohn had called me, and I thought 'Aw, that's really sweet and that's awesome but I'm sure those guys have peaked.' I mean, it's ten seasons and they're such brilliant minds, but they've been writing it for ten years. The first page of the first episode of season ten did it. I was like 'Wow. Okay, game on.' They just knocked my socks off.\n\nI was so thrilled that they'd even called me and said 'Hey, do you want to come visit for a little while?'\n\nWhat Sara & Grissom Have Been Up To Since Leaving CSI\n\nWhen we left Grissom on his last episode, we presumed that Grissom and Sara were living together, happily ever after, suspended in reality, in the jungles of Costa Rica. Which is a lovely place to get to spend time in, I highly recommend it. If you're gonna disappear, do it there.\n\nWe sort of set the stage- We haven't revealed all that much of where they've been and what they've been up to, but that they traveled extensively over the last year, they had somehow landed in Paris, waiting for - they're married - they're waiting for a grant to come through.\n\n How Sara Returns to Vegas\n\nFrom my perspective, and Sara's, Sara never wanting to be the doting housewife that doesn't want to have her own thing going on, gets a phone call from Ecklie that says they're a man down, a man short, and could she recommend anybody to come in to Vegas. And so Sara decides to take the job on a very short term basis, while her husband does his thing, to give him the space to teach and to do what he does, and not feel that she's just kind of sitting around, watching him do what he does.\n\nThat's sort of the setup, that's about as much as *I* know so far.\n\nCan Sara and Grissom Survive A Long Distance Relationship?\n\nI do think that they're pretty comfortable, sort of having a long distance relationship. Especially now that they know - you know, wedding ring - that this is going to be the course of their lives, that they're going to share their lives together. Now that they have that security and stability, I think they both feel confidant that they can go and do things and come back together.\n\n The Effort Behind The Spectacular Season 10 Opener\n\nYes, I was very, very surprised by the amount of work the actors were going to put on it. I was completely blown away by the amount of work post was going to have &#8212; even after we shot these really labor intensive, lengthy, took hours to set up, hours to rehearse, every move had to be so very precise &#8212; the post production was going to be thirty times what shooting time was on it.\n\nBeing Partnered With George Eads in The Season 10 Opener\n\nI was very, very lucky &8212; not only because I love George Eads like a brother &#8212; that I was partnered up with him, but George had had, he'd gone through pretty serious back surgery this past summer and so when they were setting up who was going to be where and what characters were doing, because he still sort of - he's about 90% there on his strength, he's been working very hard to get up to par, they set George and I in, probably, the simplest pose of the group. I thought \"How lucky am I that I get to be next to George.\" Cause that's why I, in a way, get to do something simple.\n\nI decided that Sara's sort of a little bit by the book, so she's holding her gun in a very, sort of textbook police officer way. George Eads, being the cowboy that he is, is all \"I'm gonna do it a little fancier, and I'm gonna have my gun &#8212; one arm kind of bent and looking around the corner.\" I think we both underestimated when we started the night how long we were going to have to hold those guns in the air without flinching. Without moving at all. It was very hard work for George that night, to do that, over the course of that time, still getting his strength back.\n\nWe got really lucky, and it was still hard.\n\nThe Challenge of The Season 10 Opener\n\nWe had to reset several times for the tiniest little movements. After take eight or nine, even though I had taken this really easy gun stance, my hand eventually \\makes her hand quiver\\. As the night wore on, I think we had real guns as well, which are a lot heavier than the fake guns that we use, because they were seeing these guns very closely. They had to be the real weapons and they're definitely heavier than the other stuff we mess around with most of the time. \n\n Working With Laurence Fishburne\n\nIt's been super cool. I'm a huge fan of his work, for such a long time now. Most of the time that I've actually been watching movies and TV, Laurence Fishburne's been there, he's been working since he was like 13 years old. I remember him from those early, early days, Apocolypse Now. I still get a little nervous around him, to be perfectly honest with you. He's a man that, at least with me, very graciously really look me in the eye for a long time and I get a little nervous.\n\nOur very first scene that we had together, which is in the season opener, in episode one, we started a shot where it's, literally, Laurence and I are in mid-handshake. So we're shaking hands, and we're looking each other in the eye, for a much longer time than is natural. You've got the director \"Rolling,\" okay, \"Reset,\" \"Action,\" these are all long beats, and it's just this hold of the two of us like that. And that was the first day that I worked with him. \n\nIt was daunting, it was a little daunting, it was amazing, and you get to really see, sort of, behind someone, on a day like that. There was just nothing there but kindness and wisdom.\n\nDealing with Blood & Gore Again / Getting Back Into Swing of CSI\n\nSo far, so good! I've been a little detached. Sara's been a little detached, I've been a little detached from that. The stuff that's been really hard for me has been the crime scene work and the processing. I mean, I haven't done that in two years.\n\nI came back and did four shows, just last year, to sort of help Grissom arc and Billy's arc, as he was leaving the show. But I was just Grissom's girlfriend. I wasn't walking around with a vest or a flashlight or a pair of tweezers.\n\nI always knew it was a skill, and I always had a deep appreciation while I was watching everybody else. But to be two years out of doing that, and to come to set, they had to wait for me a little bit. And they've all been very, very patient and kind. Things I could do without even blinking two years ago, I have to practice and study. I blow takes. I'm behind the curve.\n\nIt's humbling for me and interesting. I'm hoping maybe, maybe, by December I'll sort of have my act together a little bit.\n\n Keeping CSI: At The Top / A Decade Of Success\n\nI think it's a real, humongous, testament to the writers that managed to keep the stories interesting and different and authentic. Unfortunately, there's no shortage of crime in America from which to pull from the headlines. That's the bad side of this show. There will continue to be stories that the writers will read about and become fascinated by.\n\nThat's sort of the good thing, but at the same time, every week that we write an episode, it gets harder to write that next episode. To do it where people can't say \"Oh that reminds me exactly of season three.\" Especially when they have so many of the same characters that they did. I'm sure that the writers sometimes are like \"Couldn't we just trade for two weeks with the LOST cast? I mean just to freshen it up!\" Just to have somebody else to work with. Send these actors to ABC and ABC sends actors to CBS.\n\nThey probably get so sick of us.\n\nThe Impact Of \"Executive Producer\" Carol Mendelsohn\n\nI don't think that CSI would exist without Carol Mendelsohn. You know, not anywhere even close to what it is. There's such a dance of relationships that she really, in many way, is the ringleader. The ring master. She's the conductor of the orchestra.\n\nAnd while she's doing all that, she's also writing. She's also the force of so much of the creativity that's feeding the show as well. She's an amazing, spectacular woman. She's impeccably good at what she does. She makes it look easy, as if she's just making a pot of coffee.\n\nI don't think anybody would probably at least still be here if it weren't for her. If not ever be here.\n\n CSI: Being Snubbed By The Critics & Overlooked By The Award Shows\n\nIt is pretty rare, once a show gets into season six and seven and eight and nine, that it gets mentioned in those kinds of areas. It's very typical [to be overlooked] and you can't even take it remotely personally. It's just the nature of the \"critical acclaim\" arena, I guess. \\laughter\\ Whatever that club is.\n\nBut yeah, and especially the behind the scenes work. The cinematography, the lighting, the directing, the art direction, the special effects, makeup &#8212; I could go on and on down the list. I believe beyond any shadow of any doubt that I work with the most talented people in the television business. And when you do get to a point, okay, it's ten years of working nine, ten months a year, every day, around the clock, sometimes fifteen, seventeen hours a day. Of course, I would love to see the kind of recognition everybody around here deserves.\n\nWe've been so lucky. I've worked on some other shows that were really popular once, and they didn't get a lot of critical love either. So I do wonder if you're really lucky if you get one thing or another. I don't know if there's been a show that's gotten all three: the ratings, the fans and the awards at the same time. It seems that life doles out fairly for people. You're on a cable network, you might not have so many viewers, but we're going to give you a cool award because you're great.\n\nIf I had to pick between the three, I would definitely pick the fans. There's no doubt about it, the fans built this show, maybe more profoundly than most shows on television. Honestly, really if it hadn't been for the fans, we wouldn't be here. I've been really grateful for that.",

Bolivia recently did what every country should do &#8212; banned the use of animals in circuses. These majestic animals will live out their lives at the amazing Paws Sanctuary in northern California.\n\nOur guest tonight, CSI star, Jorja Fox, who was right there for their dramatic arrival. \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJORJA FOX, ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Lion number one &#8212; come on down.\n\nTIM PHILLIPS, ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL: These lions have lived their life in a tiny, rusting, disgusting cage on the back of a lorry. Tomorrow they're going to feel the wind blow in their face. They're going to feel grass beneath their feet. They're going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: I am so thrilled to welcome actress Jorja Fox, ambassador for Animal Defenders International. Jorja, great to see you.\n\nTell us how you felt inside watching these majestic animals take their very first steps into freedom. \n\nFOX: Well, Jane, thanks for having me. It was sheer magic. It was such a beautiful moment. You know, these kind of thing don't happen very often. I wish that I can say that they did. But to see animals that have been in cages their entire lives, large, endangered, land mammals, take to grass is a spectacular thing to see. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Now, while in the circus, two of the rescued lions had their fang cut out so the trainers could handle them. Another had her claws ripped out one by one without any anesthesia. You know it's time for this kind of institutionalized animal torture to stop.\n\nCheck this out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPHILLIPS: There's a welfare problem at the moment, but that's in the circuses. If we shut them we can give these animals a great life. So the world is watching. \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Jorja, what do people need to know about the scores of animals who are still suffering in the captivity of zoos and circuses around the world? \n\nFOX: Well, I think there's several thing that people should know. Number one, most of these animals are on the endangered species list or on the vulnerable list. We have so few resources left on this planet. And I really think it's our responsibility to care for the one that we have.\n\nThe unfortunate truth about zoos and circuses is that they're cruel, they're arcane, they are not suitable places for animals, especially large wild animals. I think we've evolved beyond them. I think there's a lot of people out there who realize in the same way that we've evolved beyond asbestos and lead paint that we're now at a place in our evolution where we can say, you know what, this is not a compassionate thing, this is not a smart thing. It's a waste of resources and it's a waste of these animals' lives.\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Now, when you saw the animals go from their cages and actually step on grass for the very first time, what do you think they were thinking? What kind of a transformation did they experience?\n\nFOX: Well, these are animals that really had spent most of their lives in small pens on the back of a truck. Even though they were exhausted &#8212; it was a 14-hour journey &#8212; they weren't fed during the journey. They did have access to water.\n\nWhen they finally reached the sanctuary in a very rural, remote area in California, they leapt. They leapt like you would see small puppies leaping outside in the park somewhere. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: I am so happy and thank you so much. And the animals thank you.\n\nYey, Jorja Fox of CSI. And we love these lions. If you love them &#8212; hey, don't go to the circus.  ",

George turned me on to it.\n\nGE: I was telling you the other night!\n\nJF: \"I was watching this show the other night and you gotta check it out!\" And I went and checked it out, and now it's on my TiVo. So this is definitely a story George has wanted to tell for a while. It was in the making, it was gonna happen, and now it's happening. It is really exciting when that ... happens.\n\nGE: One of the things that we don't have to deal with when we go to crime scenes is the odor. So we got lucky when it comes to that, because it's 'Movie Trash.' It's still pretty disgusting under there.\n\n[...]\n\nJF: It's unbelievable, and you've got three and a half straight days in there. So yes, again, thank god it's a set, but its extremely tight quarters. It's very intimate. You get the crew in there setting lights, and move through it.\n\nGE: Yeah but we talked about how there's nobody we'd rather be with if we were stuck in a stinky set in tight quarters. You know?",

These animals do deserve our kindness, and they do deserve our respect. And I think that often our kids understand that better than us most of the time/\n\nIf our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd be very disappointed in us, for bringing us to these places.\n\nThis bill is the right thing to do, and I urge you to let your congresspeople know that you support it.\n\nThank you very much.",

And that's one of the things that I think makes it so fun, because it's not really &#8212; because I don't do it competitively, I never feel like I've stopped learning. For me, it can lower my ambition, to go out and surf for a few hours, is so fulfilling and seems almost like an education. And you feel kind of completely at peace afterwards. I did notice how as my goal got smaller as I started surfing, my ambitions got smaller as I started surfing. But I don't know if that's a bad thing!\n\n[...]\n\nProbably the most recent amazing thing that happened &#8212; I was out with a friend of mine, at a beach that we go to often. We have a pretty long whale season in California, and as we were paddling out, there was a whale making her way north, back towards Alaska. To be on a surfboard and to see that is almost hard to put into words.",

        "content": "\nARTIST ON DEMAND: I'm Danni and I'll be your host today. We have another very exciting show this afternoon. We'll be talking to Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle on CSI. If you don't know what CSI is, you must have been living under a rock. So. While we are waiting for her to call in, we'll take a music break. So enjoy it. This is going to be Kimberly Cole, \"Arrow through my Heart\". (music plays). ['¦] I'm very excited! We do actually have Jorja, so I'm going to go ahead and bring her on. Hi, Jorja, how are you? \n\nJORJA FOX: Hey, Danni. How's it going? I'm good.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: I'm great. We're very excited! We don't have a whole lot of time so I want to jump right into it. Because obviously CSI is premiering Season 12 starts. What can we expect? What are some of the biggest changes we're going to see this year?\n\nJORJA FOX: Well, we're counting down, you know we're always hopeful about a new season. It's one of the best times of the year actually, is to get to work and not be on the air because you can just kind of go away and concentrate on your stuff and not worry too much about, you know, the ratings and all the other stuff that comes with premieres. \n\nBut obviously we have a new, two new actors that have joined us this year, the first one being Ted Danson, who I swear I've seen feathers coming out of the back of his jacket. I think he's an angel. I will confirm that later in the year. He's just the warmest, coolest cat and so funny. So you know, that's on. CSI might just be a bit funnier this year. We've done some dark humor stuff. We love to put comedy in the show where we can. There's just something about having Danson with us that I've got bets that we might be a funnier show this year. He's going to join the cast tonight. \n\nAnother surprise is we have Elizabeth who plays Morgan, who kind of guest starred on the show near the end of last season. She was a lab tech when some of the cast when to Los Angeles when we were chasing this horrible serial killer. She was in the lab and she's going to join us this season. She's Marc- Ecklie's daughter, who is often the evil villain top of the police chain, that gives a lot of the characters a hard time. So she'll be with us. I think she's, I can't remember if she's in this episode tonight, I think she joins us next week. She's fantastic and edgy and young. So we're looking to have a really good year. We're really optimistic and hope the fans stick with us.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Well, I am very excited. I'm sure fans are too. Obviously, you have to be a fan favorite. Was it a shock for you when you left in 2007 and you saw all the fans campaigning to get you back? What was that like? \n\nJORJA FOX: Uh. It was probably the nicest thing that's ever happened to me. And uh, really overwhelming and a surprise. You know I kind of left because I was exhausted. And I think somewhere along the way because I'd had some skirmishes in the past with the show, I think some of the fans thought I was being sort of angled off the show. And I just needed to lie down for a while and take a break. And so it was, it was really, you know, to this day it still kind of still surprises me when I think about it. I got some rest and then I came back. And then Billy got tired and so he left. And we're hearing murmurs that Marg is tired. The year will '¦ You know, CSI &#8212; I think we do some of our best work when we have unexpected changes. \n\nThey're always devastating. Nobody knew that Lawrence wasn't going to be coming back. And that was heartbreaking for me. He's a great guy and I really loved working with him and then sort of in the middle of the summer, we got this email during the middle of the night that perhaps he wouldn't be joining us. You know, I guess in some ways it's a good thing when there are changes to a show that's been on for 12 years. In other ways, it's really sad and hard to adjust to. And even though we're not necessarily what people would think of as a character-driven show, you know, the fans get attached to characters and we certainly, tended to fall in love with each other. \n\nThat's one thing that CSI has been really good at is they've always seemed to bring people into the cast that really get along and have a lot of chemistry. So it is hard to say goodbye when people want to, but I understand because I was the first one that got tired and needed to lie down. I understand other characters do to.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Well you did come back so obviously you love playing Sara. What is one of your favorite things about being on the show and playing her?\n\nJORJA FOX: I think one of my favorite things, and this is probably weird considering it is CSI, but, I got to do this sort of long, slow kind of mysterious love story in the midst of the show with William Petersen. You know, it was sort of over five or six seasons. I was always struck by through all the darkness and all the heaviness and all the despair, that somewhere in there could be this idea of love and intimacy and sort of a stability. \n\nAnd so it's also been one of the hardest to play now that he's gone. You know, I think that Sara's kind of, she's lonely'¦and I think she's getting slightly more frigid by the episode since he's not around. (laugh). It's hard to have a long-distance love affair. I think we've all had at least one in our lives. So I miss him but playing that love story and the fact that they're still married and that they're still in love is kind of one of the most fun things for me to do.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Now obviously aside from that, that's got to be an emotional you know, having that long distance relationship, but Sara's gone through some really emotional storylines, being kidnapped, everything like that [Jorja says Ugh!]. Any particular episode that sticks out as being particularly nerve-racking for you to shoot?\n\nJORJA FOX: One of the hardest, most recent episodes is actually this episode we did about hoarders and which George Eads and Eric Szmanda had a real big storyline in. It had been George's dream, he'd started watching some of the documentary shows that are on about hoarding and became quite obsessive compulsion about that in his own way and had made some suggestions to the writers that we need to do one of these'¦we should tell this story, this would be great. And so about a year and a half coming, and when the episode came out, we were thrilled for George and I was thrilled that I got to be a part of it, but you know, even though we built a set that was actually a hoarder's house, it was incredibly claustrophobic. \n\nEven though all the garbage was set garbage, so it wasn't real garbage, by the time we got out of there, we spent about four days on that set, and something inevitably did start to smell quite bad. It took three days to figure out I think it was a bag of frozen noodles that was supposed to in the fridge that somebody forgot to unpack. It ended up like under eight feet of sheets, and televisions and video tapes, and so even by day three there was a smell on stage that nobody could quite put their finger on and we were worried that it was like a mouse or something that had met with a horrible demise. \n\nWhen we got off that stage when we were done, I didn't realize, I knew I was a little claustrophobic and I know that I'm not a stuff person, I'm more a minimalist person, and it confirmed everything that I thought about myself when we were finally done. It was hard to shoot but we were really happy with the outcome.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: I can't even imagine.\n\nJORJA FOX: Yeah, it was intense, and put a whole camera crew in there, you know, it was just like little, we called them goat trails, these tiny little pathways throughout the set, where everybody would try and hang lights and stuff.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: It has to be amazing to be a part of something like this. In early 2011, CSI was the most watched show in the entire world. So what is it like knowing you're a part of such a phenomenon? \n\nJORJA FOX: That, first of all, is an amazing compliment. And it's kind of a serial, because the ratings have slipped a bit in the States, but we still have our game on, you know we're still hoping that this year we're going to surprise everybody one more time. First of all, it's such an honor to be the number one show once, even just one week, forget a couple weeks in a row, and here worldwide. I got to travel to Europe this summer, which I hadn't done in a few years. And that was an amazing experience. It doesn't really hit home, sometimes, until you go out into the world and you start talking to people and meeting people. \n\nI was in some pretty remote places, the southern tip of Europe, but everybody's got a satellite dish! I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm going to have a kind of low key vacation! It'll be quiet and I won't think about CSI for a few weeks.' and I was very pleased to find out everybody was watching the show, and knew who I was. It's amazing, and it is, like, to have &#8212; We've been very lucky to have a pretty diverse crowd that's followed the show. Not only is it age-wise and ethnicity and different regions of America, like wether it's city people or country people, but to think about that it goes out beyond the States is a really, really, really amazing feeling.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Very awesome. Now, aside from CSI, anything you're working on right now?\n\nJORJA FOX: Oh gosh, I'm always shuttling around my little projects that I love. I have a feature documentary that we've just finished. That's really the story of 14-year old girl that goes to Thailand to learn about elephants. The movie's called \"How I Became An Elephant.' We have a website, it's http://howibecameanelephant.com, and we've submitted to festivals. It's a really exciting documentary. There are some hard things to watch, obviously. Elephants sometimes get a raw deal in our post-modern world, where space is at a premium. It's a beautiful story. We're hoping &#8212; We're going to do the festivals for a few months. We're talking to distributors.\n\nI would love to tell you more about that in a few months.\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Very awesome. Those are pretty much all the questions that I have for you, because this is such a short time. But if you wouldn't mind, we like to get a tag from all of our guests. So if you would just say 'This is Jorja Fox. You're listening to Artists on Demand.'\n\nJORJA FOX: Okay great! And I'm sorry, I would have been listening to your station this morning, but I was scared to hear my voice in stereo while we spoke! [everyone laughs] Hey! This is Jorja Fox, and you're listening to Artists on Demand Radio!\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Awesome. Well thank you so much for coming on and talking to us. Definitely we'd love to have you back again. In the meantime-\n\nJORJA FOX: Thank you! I love you guys, you guys do great stuff!\n\nARTIST ON DEMAND: Oh, thank you! Well it was such a pleasure and have a great day!\n\nJORJA FOX: Alright! You too, thanks.\n\n[...]  \n",

I'm thrilled that I get on the list, and I don't even know how that happens. It may have to do with the little bit of green that I slip them to put me on it.\n\nGlittarazi: Oh! Okay! I guess my other question is how would you like to expand or take this cause one step further? What strategies do you have in place? Or what do you have going on right now?\n\nJorja Fox: You mean me trying to be one of PETA's sexiest vegetarians?\n\nGlittarazi: No, I think we've got that one pretty much well covered. No I think we're talking about the one that you're advocating for today.\n\nJorja Fox: Yes! I'm here in Washington DC today and I get to be a part of this amazing group of people today. We're launching a bill called TEAPA. It's the \"Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act.\" I'm over the moon, I've never been to congress before in this fashion. We're going to meet a lot of representatives this afternoon. The bill's out ... What can people do? People could get sort of involved. The biggest thing right now is to spread the message and spread the word. In order for any bill to have a chance in congress the public has to know about it, and they kind of have to get their congress-people excited about passing it. If what we came here today to talk about is popular and people agree with it, and I really think they do and they will, especially if they take some time to look at the information, then this bill will pass and .. These animals, these large land mammals that so many of us love and adore, I think really deserve better at this point. And I think that if we want to leave a planet for our kids and their kids, a good planet, the survival of these animals is absolutely imperative. We need them. We don't just &#8212; We think that maybe we won't, but we actually do to survive.\n\nGlittarazi: Absolutely. So if you could star in a PSA with any politician, who would it be?\n\nJorja Fox: Well! I'm going to just shoot for the stars and the moon because you're asking me. It would have to be, you know, it would have to be the President, Obama.\n\nGlittarazi: I think you could probably arrange that ... slip a few greenbacks. So speaking of the President, seeing that we are in DC, is this your first time in the city?\n\nJorja Fox: I've had the pleasure of being in DC many, many times throughout my life. I'm always excited when I come here. Usually when I come here, it's for something really amazing, like this bill. I have yet to be to the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Monument. That's on my list to try and do before I go home, it's a short trip. I'm going to make it happen.\n\nGlittarazi: Okay. When you come into DC, where are some of the usual places you like to check out?\n\nJorja Fox: Because it's usually two to three years between visits for me, there's very few places I go back to again and again, unlike the Lincoln Monument &#8212; Memorial. I think I've seen it every single time I've been here. I love to walk in the park. But the restaurants ... It's funny because &#8212; I'm from New York City originally, and I would say about my own city what I would say, perhaps naively, about DC. And it's that it seems to never ever change, and yet it's completely different at the same time. I went to a really great restaurant last night that I'd never heard of and I'd never been to. I try to check out new stuff, I guess, when I come.\n\nGlittarazi: What was that restaurant called? Do you remember?\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah it's called The Science Club.\n\nGlittarazi: Science Club? Okay!\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, very good wine and beer. Vegan options. Lots of veggie stuff.\n\nGlittarazi: Awesome. Do you have any other upcoming projects that you'd like to tell us about?\n\nJorja Fox: I'll be working, fightin' crimes, I think for the next six or seven months. Also I have a little documentary that I've been working with a couple people on for a couple years. It's about elephants in Thailand. Wild Animals are a passion of me. The story is really about a 14 year-old girl who travels to Thailand, learns about elephants, and brings that knowledge home with her. \n\nGlittarazi: Okay.\n\nJorja Fox: That's called \"How I Became an Elephant.\"\n\nGlittarazi: Awesome.\n\nJorja Fox: We submitted it to the festivals. So we're waiting to hear. Wish us luck. \n\nGlittarazi: We'll look out for that one. As a vegetarian, what are some of your favorite dishes or recipes you recommend?\n\nJorja Fox: Well. I think that a good cookbook is imperative if you're a vegetarian or vegan. Tal Ronnen has a terrific book out that I love. Baking is especially, I think, key. I think a lot of people think when it comes to cookies and cakes and stuff like that, you have to have eggs and butter all over it. But there are some amazing alternatives right now. Definitely I'd start going on-line. PETA has some great cook books. They almost always have a couple of recipes on their website. Start there and get the book and you'll have great food.\n\nGlittarazi: Okay, awesome. Well that you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. We hope that your new initiative goes well here.\n\nJorja Fox: Yes, thank you so much.\n\nGlittarazi: We wish the best of luck.\n\nJorja Fox: Thank you.\n\nGlittarazi: Thank you.\n\n",

Tomorrow they're going to feel the wind blow in their face. They're going to feel grass beneath their feet. They're going to roam into the bushes. They're going to do whatever they want. They're going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Tonight, an unprecedented flight to freedom for 25 magnificent animals. Bravo. Abused lions rescued from hideous conditions in Bolivia are now living out their lives in an amazing Colorado sanctuary. Last week's operation was the largest ever rescue of its kind. It could not have been done without the help of two amazing animal-loving celebrity who join me right here on ISSUES tonight. I'm talking about my dear friends and my heroes, Bob Barker and Jorja Fox.\n\nNow, when Jorja is not busy solving murders on CSI &#8212; come on, how many episodes have you seen her on, right? This time she is investigating real life crimes against animals.\n\nAnd of course, Bob Barker is a legend from \"The Price is Right\" fame. You know, he is my hero because he helped pay for this massive rescue mission. I think he gave something like $200,000. He is an amazing, amazing hero for the animals and he's long time vegetarian and just an activist all the way around for these animals.\n\nListen to this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBOB BARKER, ANIMAL ACTIVITIES: Help control the pet population, have your pet spayed or neutered.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. Have your pet spayed and neutered. That's his famous line.\n\nStraight out to my dear friends: Jorja Fox and Bob Barker; Jorja, going to start with you. First of all, bravo to all of you, to both of you and the organizations involved for getting these animals out.\n\nTell us about the conditions that these poor, poor lions have endured for their entire lives. What did you get them out of, Jorja? \n\nJORJA FOX, ANIMAL ACTIVIST: Jane, thank you so much for having us. Again it's a pleasure to be with you.\n\nTo give you a few examples we had eight lions, a pride of lions, a whole family living together. This is adult lions, living on the back of a truck, the size of two double beds. That's one example of the conditions of these animals.\n\nAnother lion had been in a very small zoo cage for 11 years; hadn't seen another lion in all of that time. Two other lions had never seen another lion before; they were kept in small cages in circuses all by themselves. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Some of these lions, literally as you just heard, never set foot outside a small, filthy cage. Now, take a look at these conditions. No surprise that many were malnourished, stressed and traumatized. But within days of being rescued they were healthier, they were less aggressive, they had shiny coats even. Listen to this. \n\nBob Barker, again, you gave $200,000 to help make this happen. You are my hero. What runs through you emotionally when you see these animals taken from this hellish situation and put in this fabulous sanctuary where they literally have a 15,000 square foot biosphere to live out their lives as if in nature? Bob. \n\nAll right. Jorja, went to take that one? \n\nFOX: Yes, I just wanted you to know that the biosphere is actually temporary. It is 15,000 square it, it has heat, it's got grass inside, it has toys. This is merely a space for the lions to acclimate to the Denver climate.\n\nIn a couple months they will have 80 full acres to share there. The animal sanctuary, a wild animal sanctuary north of Denver has two other lion prides. And it was a surprise to me to find out that lions actually are genetically wired for winter as they traversed Africa they spent a lot of time in the mountains in northern Africa, it gets very cold. So this will be a great place for them. But because they're just out of Bolivia they're going to stay a little warmer until the weather warms up a bit. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: well, I want to go to my big issue. I got to say, zoos are basically prisons. Ok. That is my opinion. It is easy to criticize other nations where zoos are terrible.\n\nBut let's talk about the United States. We have countless animals, like Billy the elephant, he is the subject of a huge battle. He is stuck in concrete enclosure at the L.A. Zoo with no companion. See the way they're rocking like that. That is a sign of distress.\n\nThese animals are not meant to live this way, Bob Barker. What would you say to anybody who goes to a zoo? \n\nBARKER: Well, let me say first, that I have heard nothing that has been said thus far. So, I don't know what you have asked me. I understand you've been talking.\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL:L Tell me about the zoos, Bob, come on. Tell us about the zoos and why you are against them? \n\nBARKER: I am against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals. And the Los Angeles Zoo has kept that poor Billy out there for years, alone with &#8212; \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: More after the break. More Bob.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We certainly couldn't have done it without your help, Mr. Barker. \n\nBARKER: Line number one, come on down. \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. This is an amazing story, the largest airlift of lions ever, thanks to Bob Barker, of \"Price is Right\" fame; a second chance at life for 25 beautiful lions. They spent their entire lives in filthy cages as part of really deplorable Bolivian circuses and we're going to show you that video as we talk.\n\nBob Barker, the Bolivians aren't really the bad guys here because they're actually way ahead of us. They've actually passed a law that the United States needs to pass. Tell us about it. \n\nBARKER: Well, the ADI people went undercover and they collected such horrendous tape on the treatment of animals in Bolivia that the government actually passed this legislation that banned circuses that used any animals, even domestic animals. They are banned in Bolivia.\n\nAnd after that legislation was passed, with other wildlife organizations, ADI went out and gathered up lions and other animals of all kinds and the lions, they brought to the United States, 25 beautiful lions. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Jorja why don't we do this in the United States? We just showed you video of Billy, the elephant at the L.A. Zoo. We could put him up again. You could tell he is in distress, he's rocking back and forth. There's been, I don't know how many legal battles over this elephant. They want to keep that elephant.\n\nThere's a sanctuary that's dying to take him. There he is. Look, when they rock back and forth like that, that shows that they are not happy, they are in distress, this poor guy on concrete.\n\nNow, Bolivia is ahead of the United States. Why the heck, when we have the video here, this animal is not happy, we cannot get this animal freed to go to a sanctuary? \n\nJORJA: Well, Jane, I want to say, you know Billy is an amazing example of just how horrible zoos can be for animals. He is not the exception, you know. Billy's story is a very, very common story. He happens to be one of the more famous elephants out there.\n\nI think it is coming to the United States. I think that the more people find out what's going on and also examples, it is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish very quickly. And when you hear a success story like that and you see that it can actually be done, and you see these lions moving to a sanctuary, it brings it all into the realm of the possible.\n\nI think in the United States, we are going to see a movement like this becoming more and more powerful over the next couple of years. It's a long time coming. And I believe in the goodness of people. This lion expedition was really for the lions and about the lions.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it was a true testament to the human spirit and what people can accomplish when they work together to make something great happen; so many people stepped forward.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Absolutely. Yes. And I want to thank some of the organizations. You can help the lions as well by supporting the amazing groups that were involved and made this happen, check out Animal Defenders International, you can go to AD-International.org. You can also visit wildanimalsanctuary.org and make a donation and get involved.\n\nListen, Bob Barker, I am going to give you the last word. You are just a hero. What would you say to Americans about zoos? \n\nBARKER: Well, I think that the progressive, well-informed zoos are already closing their elephant exhibits. I would like to see them close all of the big animal exhibits. I think that the sooner that there are &#8212; \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: We are out of time. I love both of you. Thank you. \n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  \n",

That word, \"break\". \n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elephants are extremely social and they need the environment, they need movement, they need exercise. \n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Abused, 24 hours until the baby totally lost their mind. Many baby died. \n\nThen the baby elephant fear the man. The man can control and the boy make baby elephant obey. \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: We're talking about another kind of crime right now. We've got a famous CSI investigator on this case looking into disturbing horrific animal abuse. You recognize her &#8212; from CSI? That's right. The CSI investigator, known to the rest of the world as Jorja Fox and she is fighting for elephants.\n\nWhen people use elephants as entertainment, most don't think, oh, they see these beautiful animals going here, there or everywhere. They don't realize how these animals were captured; how they were taken from the wild. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans.\n\nBut one 14-year-old girl figured it out. She made the connection. And now she is making a movie, \"How I Became an Elephant\" and it's changing hearts and saving lives, one person and one elephant at a time.\n\nJoining me now to talk about her passion for this heroic effort, actress Jorja Fox, star of CSI; you know her from this show. Check it out. \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You showed your hand today to a master manipulator, your words. \n\nJORJA FOX, ACTRESS, ANIMAL ACTIVIST: She has a right to know. She did this, five years ago, three weeks ago, and she's going to do it again. \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: What do you want to say for the elephants and the movie you're making to save the elephants? \n\nFOX: Well, what I would like to say is I would like to see sort after of a transformation or an evolution in the way that a lot of people view elephants in the way elephants are treated, particularly in captivity, in the entertainment industry, in circuses and zoos. The movie that we made is called, \"How I became an Elephant\".\n\nAnd truly about a 14-year-old girl who travels to Thailand to learn about elephants. She meets probably the person of elephant information across the globe. The name is Lek Chailert and she has an elephant sanctuary there in Thailand. A lot of people don't realize that there's really only been one way to train elephants from hundreds of thousands of years. It goes back. It is an Asian technique. To this day in 2011, we are using the same technique. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Is it cruel? \n\nFOX: It is beyond cruel. It's beyond. It is completely barbaric and horrific. If you see an elephant in captivity, including a zoo, even if they're not doing a trick, they have probably been trained with these techniques. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, Juliette saves an elephant in this documentary. Her bravery is important because these horrific animals, well, they are innocent. Nobody can speak for them except human beings who care.\n\nCheck this out. It is called \"The Crash Box\". \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were tied, maybe everything; tied the ear, the tail, the leg, and at the time maybe lost freedom. Moaning, screaming all night. \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Where to help &#8212; all right, if you want to help, what do you do, Jorja? \n\nFOX: You go to howibecameanelephant.com. You stop going to circuses and zoos. Sanctuaries are great. We have elephants in captivity that we're going to need to house. Go to a sanctuary and see them there. Don't support those kinds of industries. If you are in Thailand be very, very careful; there's over 300 trekking organizations in Thailand. Go to the right one.\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. We're going to leave it there. Love you Jorja.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: And you, of course, know Jorja Fox from \"CSI\". And there you are, Jorja Fox working on CSI as an investigator. You've actually used some of the skills that you learned on the show to help you investigate the plight for elephants. \n\nFOX: Yes. Indeed. Research is really the key. In that clip I'm getting hammered by my new boss actually for being a renegade, which is not the first of probably the last time that will happen to me personally and on the show. \n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: You're an animal lover.\n\nFOX: I am.\n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: Things are changing in the world, aren't they, for animals? \n\nFOX: Well, yes. And I'm an environmentalist and a conservationist. And we're really at a critical, critical point. I mean if you look at the (INAUDIBLE) list of endangered animals, if we keep going the way we're going in another 50 years we really critically won't have a lot of the animals that we, as humans, need to survive on the planet. It's not fun and games anymore. \n\nVELEZ-MITCHELL: I don't have any kids, you don't have any kids, but people who have kids want to have animals for them. \n\nFOX: Yes. I would like us to be able to stay on this planet. I don't want to move it Mars. I would like to stay here and I'd like &#8212; \n\n(CROSSTALK)  \n",

        "content": "\n*Pets In The City: *For many of us, the circus brings back fond memories of lions, tigers, and other large, beautiful creatures performing incredible acts of courage and agility usually with their tamers and trainers on board. But in recent years, the ability of some circuses to properly care for these large beasts has been under scrutiny. This scrutiny has not been limited to the United States. Joining us today is Jorja Fox, who plays the popular character Sara Sidle on the mega hit *CSI *Las Vegas, to talk about her personal work on behalf of some very special and now globe-trotting lions that she and other notable stars have helped move from Bolivia to the U.S. through their support of Animal Defenders International and their work on Operation: Lion Arc. Thanks so much for joining us today, Jorja.\n\nJorja Fox: Oh Diane, thank you so much for having me, I'm really excited about this project.\n\nPITC: So give us a little bit of background; tell us what life is like as you know it from your involvement in this project- what life is like for a typical circus lion in Bolivia.\n\nJF: Uh... well, goodness, and that's a huge question, the organization ADI- Animal Defenders International- started an investigation, it was sort of a two-year undercover investigation, to the treatment and soft of the everyday life of circus animals throughout South America. And they found some really, really tough findings, you know, the animals are obviously kept in very small spaces, some of them are often malnourished, they were on the road all the time, the temperatures, as we know, can either be extremely hot, or extremely cold.\n\nTheir researches- it's pretty well-documented on their website- [inaudible] presented these findings to a bulk of counties in South America and they invited and soft of asked these nations if they could do better, and what could they do, and um, in a beautiful stroke of sort of, genius, a lot of the nations in South America responded lovingly and decided to ban circuses. So, this country that we're dealing with right now, Bolivia, has put in a full ban in set, uh, it was actually passed by their Congress- it's billed 40-40- and um, made traveling circuses and all circuses with large land mammals illegal. Uh, there's-\n\nPITC: Wow.\n\nJF: -three other countries right now in South America with bans that are pending, uh, including Peru, Brazil and Ecuador. Uh, Costa Rica banned a long time ago, I think, probably three or four years ago, uh, which really was phenomenal, because it was sort of ridged between Mexico and South America, and when Costa Rica decided to outlaw traveling circuses, they sort of put in effect- it became very difficult for these traveling circuses to get from one country to another, you know, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala sort of being the gateway of nations. It wasn't an easy feat, and ADI, when they were able to successfully put these bans in effect, sort of made a pledge to the country Bolivia that they would help them with any circus animal that was left over from the ban. Obviously these animals are very difficult and expensive to care for, they have huge needs, they need a lot of land and space, and um, they told Bolivia, \"Don't hesitate\", you know, \"if there's an animal, we will be responsible for them for the duration of that animal's life.\" And out of that has come Operation: Lion Arc; ADI successfully moved four lions in May of 2010 out of Bolivia to the PAWS sanctuary in Northern California.\n\nI think it was one of the first times that something like that had been done and the problem was that, um, Bolivia unfortunately, right now, doesn't really have the type of sanctuaries to care for these animals if they're not privately owned through circuses. Hence the giant air-lift, and it seems sort of like an extreme measure to take to, the different life sanctuary, and also because a lot of the laws are so different throughout a lot of those countries, um, there's a fear of leaving some of these animals behind, in essence, they could get sold off, and, and could end up almost anywhere, to a nation which hasn't banned circuses yet, and uh, the hope was really to provide- if the ban was going to take effect, you know, the dream was to improve the circumstances for these animals, not to sort of leave them in a limbo or a purgatory.\n\nSo they have gone about the country of Bolivia with the permission and the great help of the nation of Bolivia, uh including the president and mayor and governor of Santa Cruz [California], and have collected in- I think they were able to go to seven circuses in seven days, and collect a bulk of the lions and with the one final lion that they did pick up on February 4th, there's a total of twenty-five [lions], three of them are cubs, and one of them is a quite aged, half-blind lion named Kimba, who was given, uh, you know, just a brief window into [inaudible] in a cage in Bolivia, for the last eight years without ever leaving that cage...\n\nPITC: Wow.\n\nJF: ...and they had to sledge-hammer him out, they literally had to break walls down in the zoo just to get the lions out of the zoo to get him transported. You know, after he retired from some circuses, he'd been living in the zoo for eight years, so- and that went well, that went great. And they've been getting him healthy enough to travel and they will be air-lifting him on February 15 to the wild animal sanctuary just outside of Denver, Colorado. They're the largest and oldest non-profit wild-life sanctuary in the United States and, um, that's sort of just the just of it. Any circus animal- at least, I can speak for in the United States, and having done, you know, a lot of educating myself about South America- it's really one of the most unnatural things that we could ask of these animals. Um, nothing about the circus is in any way humane or natural for animals, particularly large land mammals like lions, bears, elephants, uh, even animals like zebras or llamas, it goes against the very grate of their nature, and I think that we're in the kind of history that's pretty exciting because I think a lot of people are recognizing that, and evolving beyond it, you know, there's other ways- you know, we're stuck with these animals now that can't be released back into the wild because they're not able to do so, and so what is the best possible thing that we can do for them? \n\nThe wild-life animal sanctuary in Denver, Colorado allows visitors which is one of the ways that they're able to keep the sanctuary going, and I offer that to people who really want to see these animals, who want to, you know, educate their kids about these animals; don't go to the circus, don't go the zoo. Find a sanctuary in your area, there's a decent amount of them, and take your kids there. I live in California, you know, go whale watching, don't go to Sea World.\n\nPITC: Now, you raised a number of really interesting hot topics here. Now, one thing I kind of zeroed in on is when you say having to deal with different countries, I would imagine that gets very, very delicate, (laughs) you know, when you have people from the United States going in and saying \"Hey, you're doing something wrong, we're gonna take these lions, you know, from you\", I mean, how important was it to have the local authorities behind your efforts in that?\n\nJF: I don't think it can be done *without *the local authorities and without the popular support of the region. ADI sort of started their circus campaign- you know, they're originally out of London, their headquarters is is Los Angeles now but they still have a very active office in London- and they began their campaign in Europe and they were able to implement several bans in Europe first, you know, and London has got a ban pending, and I think with the success of that they were able to branch out into other areas. I think they were connected in South America, I think that they saw that there was a dire, dire, dire need in South America, and that was one of the reasons they chose to go there next.\n\nThey're laughing their American Circus Campaign relatively soon and I think we should...\n\nPITC: Oh really?\n\nJF: Yeah, I think we should expect that within the year, as well. And because the U.S. is such a juggernaut of different laws and different recommendations and different statistics, I think that, uh, ADI has wanted to make sure that they're very well prepared before they launch and part of the air-lift I think, hopefully, will let people know that ADI is out there and will sort of bring ADI home to the United States and, and that'll create at least a platform for them to slowly begin their launch.\n\nPITC: I do have to ask you this: now, a lot of us who are \"of a certain age\", shall we say (Jorja laughs) have these fond memories of going to the circus, and I mean, it wasn't a big deal, you know, that was actually one of the big things we were looking for, you know, the lions jumping through the fire, jumping through the hoops. You know, how do you fundamentally change somebody's, I guess, childhood memories of that? You know, is there a challenge to shifting from saying \"What you were watching was horrible and awful, but we want you to watch this instead?\"\n\n*JF: *Yeah. Well, and I wouldn't want to try and reframe people's memories, you know, certainly if they have good memories, that's a great first connection, you know, because if they have a great memory of animals in a circus then probably they connected at some point that there was a, a love and admiration for these animals. So, I've been lucky enough- and I'm not all that young myself- but I've been lucky enough to you know, kind of grow up with first National Geographic and now Animal Planet *and you know, IMAX theaters, and I think that there's so many other great ways, including some of these Disney feature films that have been out, that have kind of came out of *Planet Earth, there's just so many better ways to do it now, and um, you know that the legacy of importing wild animals all over the world has been a really tragic and sad one across the globe, you know, and has led in many respects to a lot of a lot of these [animal] populations being on the brink of extinction.\n\nNow we have a whole other crisis because even if we can care for a lot of these animals, we don't have all that many places to put them where we can really call it a sanctuary, you know, whether it's in Africa or Europe, the United States, space is limited, it's very expensive, and, you know, along with global warming and so many of these other issues that are pressing on us, is how do we keep habitats and environments that's sustainable for these animals and for the next two hundred, three hundred, four hundred years for our kids and their kids? And really, in my opinion, it's sort of a balance of the planet, I mean all of these animals in the wild have very important jobs that they do, and have kept the balance of the Earth in a beautiful- I would say a very beautiful state, and I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to look around and see things, you know, everything from like, fishing populations disappearing, you know, at the base of it, we're going to have to feed ourselves and hopefully live on the planet and have enough oxygen and enough trees so we can all flourish and with that, you know, without the wild-life population, I don't think really think that's entirely possible.\n\nPITC: When you say, you know, that all of us can flourish, the lion laying down with the lamb, and us, you know, taking care of everybody as well, what occurs to me is when you do go into countries like Bolivia and you know, like certain farmers in Africa who, you know, have their crops trampled by elephants, I'm wondering, is there a very delicate balance where you can say, \"Look, we care about you humans as well, and here's an alternative that you can do to make a living as, you know, opposed to infringing upon the wild animals, you know, is that part of it as well?\n\nJF: Absolutely, like how can you make this sustainable for everybody? And I mean, my environmentalism and my animal advocacy comes directly out of love for people, you know, and I don't really want to move to Mars, you know, I mean, I guess (host laughs) that can always be a last resort, but-\n\nPITC: (laughing) CSI Mars!\n\nJF: -you know- Yeah! (laughs) I can only imagine. So of course, you know, and that's one of the bigger issues with a lot of these wild animals, is habitat encroachment, you know, and that is because the populations of people are expanding in ways that we didn't predict thirty and forty and fifty years ago, or maybe that we just didn't make space for, and that's where a lot of these clashes are coming from in terms of wild habitats. You know, there's cultural things, you know like in the U.S., I think 80% of wild [animal] trafficking ends up in the United States of China. The U.S. really loves wild animals as pets and entertainment. China loves them as pets and entertainment, they also use them for medicinal purposes and they really eat exotic animals in a way that we don't. \n\nSo we all have our cultural sensitivities and things that we can perhaps be working on, you know, for me it starts right here in Los Angeles and California and it is, you know, it's a very tense balance and you have to show a lot of respect for people, and hopefully at the same time we can all work together to make things better for all of us, instead of, you know, at the exclusion of, you know, farmers in let's say the Serengeti or, you know, a lot of animals that will be gone in twenty to twenty-five years, I mean, if you get on the [inaudible] website, I mean it's terrifying, sort of that look at what could happen. I mean now, it was a hundred years from now, then it was sixty years from now, you know now it's twenty years from now so I really invite anybody who cares about these issues, pick your specialty and get involved, because this is something that's gonna happen while most of us are on the planet, we're going to see this happen. And I do think it will lead also to the fall of the human race; I don't think that it will be exclusive to the fall of the animal kingdom. \n\nAnd why is it over so many years it seems like there's been some sort of battle- you know, maybe back when we were cave people, you know, man needed to exert his authority over the planet- at this point, we've won, I mean we won fair and square, we really-\n\nPITC: (laughs) I think that's-that's being generous that we-that we won!\n\nJF: We won that battle, and it's now my generation's time to sort of put a balance back into things. There's a lot of ways to do that, I mean there's a lot of people out there working very diligently on these projects. ADI is one of them, and you know, these animals are coming, primarily with the tremendous benevolence of Bob Barker, who over the last twenty years has just done some phenomenal things for animals, but because ADI has pledged to support these animals for the rest of their natural lives, they are actively seeking support and donations from people who are interested in adopting a lion or seeing these animals through. It's a pretty remarkable undertaking, it's the biggest seizure and rescue operation of lions ever and, um, you can go to- let me get this- savethelionsappeal.com or adiusa.org if you'd like to support this endeavor.\n\nPITC: I've seen that, you know a lot of us have trouble, you know, fitting our overhead luggage on the plane and I'm thinking My God, you know, how do you move a lion, you know-\n\nJF: Yeah.\n\nPITC: *(laughs) *-on the plane from Bolivia?\n\nJF: Twenty-five-\n\nPITC: I mean, as Jorja says, you really have to- just the logistics of moving twenty-five lions-\n\n*JF: *Mm-hmm.\n\nPITC: -is quite amazing. So we're going to take a brief break, and when we're gonna come back, and yes everyone, I am gonna ask Jorja about CSI so don't hang me, I will be right back. (Jorja and the host laugh)\n\nAfter the break...\n\nPITC: And we're back. And as you can see, Jorja Fox, in addition to being apparently a world investigator (Jorja laughs) in getting these beautiful, exotic animals back here, as we all know, she is one of our favorites on CSI Las Vegas. That's the only CSI for a lot of us out there AHEM, but anyway* (laughs)*\n\nJF: (laughs) Thank you!\n\nPITC: Jorja plays Sara Sidle who is an amazing- the evolution of that character has been amazing to watch, Jorja. What is this, the eleventh season?\n\nJF: Yes! Season eleven! Who coulda thought?\n\nPITC: And you were gone for, what, about two years, and people went bananas!\n\nJF: Ohhh, well thank you. Yeah, I took a sabbatical, it was, you know, interestingly enough I ended up doing at least a couple of episodes every season so far, but there was a year there, I took sort of a year off where I- I found myself tired and I decided that I wanted to get off TV before people noticed or before, perhaps, my coworkers started to notice. CSI was kind enough to let me go so, and then um, you know, the year passed, and I was ready to work. I did a lot of traveling, I worked on some of my own projects, little things that I've been wanting to do, and things that you know, you kind of want to do 'em when you're young enough that you'll still 'em, and, and then I started looking for work and I think I'd been looking for work for about three weeks when CSI called me and said \"Hey, I hear you're looking for work, would you like to come back?\" and I couldn't think of a single reason under the sun to say no and it's been really fun, I guess I've been back, you know, two seasons already, almost.\n\nPITC: Hold on a second, let me back-track up this. Okay, they had to call you and say \"Hey I hear you're looking for work?\"\n\nJF: Well, you know, they had given me this amazing, beautiful, dramatic goodbye with cake and flowers and (host laughs) a party and you know, I remember saying to Carol Mendehlson, who's our-\n\nPITC: -but they send you to South America, right? Didn't they send you to South America?\n\nJF: They did!\n\nPITC: Interestingly enough?\n\n*JF: *They did. Sara got to go to Costa Rica, she got on the Sea Shepherd off the Galapagos, she did all kinds of exciting things, and the last thing that I said to our show runner Carol Mendehlson was, you know, \"I'll miss you, thank you so much, I'm leaving, but I'd love to visit sometime.\"\n\n*PITC: *Mm-hmm.\n\nJF: So that sort of- that, you know, one thing led to another and I had first came back, um, when William Petersen was ready to take his sabbatical, they invited me back for a couple of shows, to sort of help him get off the show, and that's where we were left, you know, sort of suspended, you know, and it was one of these great- in my opinion, it was one of these great Hollywood endings with two characters that were going to live happily ever after, exploring the world together, there was a part of me that thought, you know, we should just let that sit, you know, the book is closed, you know, the chapter at the end says \"The End\" and it's over, and so, there was that, where I thought maybe the best thing for those characters was to just sort of stay there, and then there was this call from CSI saying \"Well why don't you just come visit for a little while?\" and I was thrilled, I never expected that to happen, you know, TV shows move on, you know, when people leave the show for whatever reason, they tend to move on, and so it was very flattering and ended up being great for me, and um, now we're sort of in a balance where I get to do a lot of episodes and, and if there's something else I want to do, like go to Denver in February and greet these lions for a few days, they are often able to tell me to go do it, so it's a great, great job. \n\nPITC: You and Grissom, and as you were saying, that's your wonderful co-star William Petersen, you guys, for a lot of people, have an ideal marriage. (Jorja cracks up) *You know, it's like, you love each other, you Skype in once in a while, \"Hey, how you doing?\", and whatever (laughs)*\n\n*JF: *Yeah!\n\nPITC: And I mean, and you, forget it, you teased everybody [in] the last episode [The Two Mrs. Grissoms] that he was on there and you guys were talking... does that mean that Gil might be coming back?\n\nJF: Well thanks for watching, first of all, and-\n\nPITC: Oh, of course!\n\nJF: -and that was, yeah, a really great scene for me, you know, I had done one episode where I was on the Sea Shepherd and I Skyped Grissom, and I essentially break up with him, you know, and say you know, I'm not going to wait for you anymore, and you know, I love you and you're free, go live your life, and sort of for that to come full circle and where I'm sitting at CSI and he's in Peru, you know, working on these ruins, well, it was a great moment, and he was kind enough to come- I don't think it means anything necessarily for the future of Grissom and Sara on CSI, that would definitely be a question for Billy [Petersen], but I was really grateful that he showed up, and you know, at least in this make-believe world, you know, Sara and Grissom are still very much in love and happily married and, and you know, they were always two very, very independent souls who kind of always went where their heart led them and, and so I think that is a great thing about their relationship that they can be together and they're both people who have both wanted to do some really exotic, crazy things and that they have the space in their relationship to allow each other to do that is really cool for me. I really like them as a couple, too.\n\nPITC: And I mean it really seems they've both evolved as characters, I mean, you've really seen them both come out of their shells and I mean every so often you hear a revelation that's like \"Wow, you know, maybe that's what forms a personality\" but I gotta tell you, one thing I really love about Sara is, you know, you see that there's a lot more to her than meets the eye, over the past ten years, I mean, she seems very shy and reserved, but I mean, highly intelligent, but very shy and reserved, and then, you know, every so often you like a pearl like you know, you find out she was in foster care, and then you find out that you know, she's had other stuff, and I mean it just seems like really inspiring to a lot of women, I think, that showing a strong woman who's overcome some hardships and has now carved out a successful career for herself.\n\nJF: Thank you, and yeah, I certainly think- and that was very polite of you, I mean, I might describe her as a little socially inept, or *(host laughs) *a little [inaudible]\n\nPITC: She's a nerd! She's a lab nerd!\n\nJF: *(laughs)* But yeah, you know, it's a testament to our writers, I think, for sure the moral of the story is that your stuff or your junk or your trauma, you know, doesn't have to define you for your entire life, you know, and I think that's a really awesome message, that you can make apple sauce out of apples, you know, that you can, you can persevere, and um, and you know, her and Grissom are very unique, I mean he was kind of eccentric himself when it came to such personal skills, and-\n\n*PITC: *Yeah!\n\nJF: And it took them a really long time&#8212; I think that they &#8212; that there was a connection between them and a chemistry but it took them both a really long time to both decide that they could actually spend their lives with another person. I think they both kind of thought of themselves as loners, and that maybe, that kind of a relationship wouldn't necessarily be something they'd experience, and they were able to make it work, you know, that's a great message too, you know, you may feel sometimes like you have trouble connecting with people, but there is somebody, somewhere, out there, you know, that might make life more fun, you know, if you share it with them. \n\nPITC: Even in a forensics lab!\n\n*JF: *Yeah! *(host laughs) *Even, even in our darkest hours, you know.\n\nPITC: You know, it also seems like you've been able to weave some aspects of your personality into Sara, I mean, she's a vegetarian, right, she's very-\n\nJF: (laughs) Yeah!\n\nPITC: She's very involved with animal rights, you don't wanna- I mean, I've seen a few episodes like that you don't want to work with meat and stuff, and is this something you requested or the writers kinda did?\n\nJF: We did an episode- it might have even been season one, I think- we did an episode, you know, it's not uncommon in forensics for scientists to use pigs in experiments, primarily because their skin is so similar to humans. So there was an episode where Grissom had gotten himself a pig from the butcher shop and was trying to recreate how long someone might have been dead by watching the pig for several days. And the way he ascertained this was through, you know, what elements, what sort of bugs would visit the body, what time, and he was successful, he was able to recreate how long this poor woman had been dead in a forest, and through that episode, you know, what happened when I got the script, because Sara's supposed to sit with Grissom over this whole thing, I called one of the writers and I said, \"You're not gonna use a real pig, right? Like, we're not, please, PLEASE don't use a real pig\" and at that point, Josh Berman, who was one of the writers on the show, said \"Why, are you a vegetarian?\" and I said, \"Well yes I am.\" and he said, \"Wow, so is my mom!\" so he said \"Well, let's make Sara a vegetarian, wouldn't that be cool?\" and I said yeah it'd be great, so it was actually a writer's idea, and uh, we used that episode as sort of a stepping off point for Sara that after having sat with that poor dead pig for three days that she made a personal change in her life that she wasn't gonna eat eat anymore, and she wasn't gonna use animals as experiments.\n\nAnd we don't use, you know, obviously, all the dead things on CSI are either real, breathing live people or prosthetic, you know, brought-to-you-by the wonders of special effects, and, uh, special effects make-up people, you know, we used a fake pig, uh, and we've reused him two or three times in the show, he's actually (laughs) he's ended up being worth his cost. \n\nPITC: (laughs) He brings home the bacon, so we say!\n\nJF: Yeah! Yeah, and I don't condone using animals for experiments, personally, but.\n\n*PITC: *I have to tell you, I have a friend who works in a forensic lab here in New York, and they say, you know what, wow, I wish that we had some of those things that-\n\n*JF: *Yeah!\n\nPITC:* (laughs)* I mean it's- the graphics, and this and that, I mean you guys, although, then again, there were many forensic scientists you've given birth to through this show.\n\nJF: Ohhhh, well thank you, that would be nice. Yeah, there was a time about three or four years ago, that we had the best-funded forensics lab in the country. (host laughs) *And it was sitting on a film stage in LA. Almost all of our equipment is real, and it's- you know, some of it is donated, some of it's purchased for the show, and so, you know, I don't know if that's as true today, but there was something really sad about that at the time, that Hollywood, you know, has the backing behind it to make that happen, there's- I think that the forensics world is doing better than it did before the *CSI shows, you know, there's some backlash to that too, in a sense that, you know, people, particularly, they want answers much quicker, you know, they (laughs) they say, \"Well yeah, but on CSI they can find out the results in, you know, five minutes\" and you have to wait a few weeks, and I think it's been helpful in court because as forensic evidence is presented, jurors have a better, sort of- it's been more acceptable to them, so forensics is not something they're hearing for the first time when they go into a courtroom. \n\nAnd thank goodness for it, you know, that's something that's really come out of, again, really, the last thirty years of science, you know, has made amazing strides, there, you know, there's a cold case just solved on the news last night of a woman who had killed her kid, I feel like it was-\n\n*PITC: *That's right, I remember seeing that. And the brother recently just came forward and said- my mother- yeah, yeah. That was sad. No, I-I-I-\n\n*JF: *-put the pieces together.\n\nPTIC: Now on the flip side of that, what I've heard, like once in a while a criticism is sort of like \"Yeah, but you're showing criminals exactly what they have to do not to get caught.\"\n\nJF: Yes! Yeah.* (host laughs) I think that's true, and I also think that there's very, very, very few ways to get away with a crime these days, you know, that window- and criminals will always try to think of ways to outsmart, you know, law enforcement- but in the age that we're living in right now, it's pretty amazing at just how little you can actually get away with, you know. And I think the show also shows that* (laughs) Like, oh well, we're probably gonna arrest you. Very few of (laughs) our criminals actually get off; it happens! I was outsmarted by a twelve-year-old, twice, the same genius twelve-year-old. Uh, you gotta watch those kids, because I think they're the most ahead of the technology, you know, of anybody. \n\n*PITC: *Oh yeah, let me tell you. You know, my niece, she's seven years old, she has an iPad, I'm like, you gotta be kidding me. \n\nJF: *Woooow. *\n\n*PITC: *Yeah, yeah, yup, it's amazing. So listen, I really appreciate you spending time with us, I would be remiss with our pets in this city at Life Radio listeners to not let them know that in addition to all this great stuff about you, you are also a native New Yorker.\n\nJF: I am indeed, yes, and I miss it dearly! There've been several times I've thought to myself, \"Why couldn't I get on that CSI *New York?\" *(laughs)\n\nPITC:* *(laughs) They don't- they don't film that in New York, right? I mean everybody's-\n\nJF: No, they do the same thing we do, and the same thing that Miami does when they go, you know, four times a year or so and they shoot exteriors, so we-we go to Vegas about four times a year, and that would probably be uh, two more times a year that I'd get to be in the city that I'm in right now, if I'm lucky I get there once or twice a year, and you know, I love it. I was born in New York City-\n\nPITC: Oh! Okay.\n\nJF: And my family relocated to a very, very, very, very small town in Florida when I was three. \n\nPITC: Oh, okay.\n\n*JF: *So I was primarily young in Florida, I had moved back to New York at the age of sixteen, I finished high school there, and uh, my family would go back and forth a lot. My mom was- had only lived in Montreal, and New York, sort of bigger cities, all her life, and had a dream of taking the kids and moving them down to a very small beach town, which is what she did- she would do, but she would also get homesick, often, for New York, so we would just pack it up, she'd take me out of school and we'd go up to New York for a week and a half or so and then come back.\n\n*PITC: *Okay, great.\n\nJF: Yeah, no, I'm a native New Yorker, and uh, my dog, unfortunately, just passed away last week at fourteen.\n\nPITC: Oh, my goodness.\n\n*JF: *She was also a native New Yorker, and my cats were also native New Yorkers.\n\nPITC: I'm so sorry.\n\nJF: Oh, thank you, yeah, it's been a rough week, but she had a really peaceful goodbye.\n\n*PITC: *Oh my goodness. And what- how do you mean they were native New Yorkers, did you adopt them from here?\n\nJF: Yeah, they were all rescues out of New York, yeah. And then I moved to Los Angeles, I guess about... fourteen years ago now? So they all made the move with me, and adapted, you know, seamlessly, of course, so the weather out here, they loved the idea of having a yard and all that kind of stuff that I didn't have in New York, so. But my dog- you know, I was living in LA when my dog came- it was sort of a weird rescue, a friend of a friend that had a dog that needed a home, and sort of one of those stories, and the original owner was an actor, so he threw out some auditions, he brought the dog, who was ten months old, and for about the first, I'd say, eight or nine months of her living in Los Angeles, all she wanted to do was walk up and down concrete streets [inaudible]. (host laughs) I couldn't get her to go hiking, she was- she just didn't get it, and then as she got a little older she was like, \"Oh, I guess this hiking thing's OK\", you know.\n\n*PITC: *Wow, that's-\n\nJF: I have had in these last fifteen years or so, two cats; one came out of a shelter in New York City, one came out of a shelter in Brooklyn, and then a Boxer- I was already living in LA- that came out of New York City out to LA to be with me, and yeah, so all three of my pets are from New York, and were all rescues.  \n**  \nPITC:** Wow. And I know you said that you had lost, um, two of them recently.\n\nJF: I lost my dog Ali last Sunday, uh, January 30th-\n\n*PITC: *Awww, I'm sorry.\n\nJF: She was fourteen years and four months young. Um, for a Boxer, that's a really, really, really long, great life, yeah. She... she was sort of on borrowed time for a few years already, and uh, yeah, I'll miss her horribly. So I'm recovering from that, I'm sure-I'm sure there will be another dog in my future, but I'm going to take a little and just celebrate her first.\n\n*PITC: *Never gets easier, it never gets easier.\n\nJF: No, no, it doesn't, and uh, that's their big joke on us, is that their lifespans are so much shorter than ours, I think* (laughs)* I was thinking, well, maybe I'll get a turtle, you know, or a parrot (host laughs) Takes them a long time! And, uh, but again, I actually don't advocate exotic pets as pets for anybody, but you know, I think about it; it'd be nice to have an animal that, you know, would be with me hopefully as long as I have left. \n\n*PITC: *Well, you know, you kinda have by proxy twenty-five lions in Colorado so there you go.\n\nJF: (both laugh) *It's gonna be exciting! I hope everybody will tune into the ADI website; they do a great job of presenting video diaries, you can sort of check updates almost daily, and sort of join along in this adventure and this journey, and um, Jan Creamer's been in Bolivia for a couple of months already, preparing everything. Tim Phillips, who's based out of London is now there too, the next time I'll see them will be at the Denver airport. We imagine February 16, probably sometime around in the day, and, uh, it is a huge undertaking as you mentioned, getting four* lions to California was a massive ordeal and the plane had to reload in Panama, so you're really bringing in three countries. You had Bolivia, you had the country of Panama and the country of the United States, that were all able to coordinate this together, they landed at San Francisco International in San Francisco. Couldn't have been more amazing, uh, it was an odd request, and not something they get everyday (host laughs) and, uh-\n\nPITC: I would imagine! \n\nJF: (laughs)\n\nPITC: \"Excuse me, customs! Uh, what do you have to declare?\" \"Oh sorry, five lions.\" (laughs)\n\n*JF: *Yeah, and you know, there's pretty strict, you know, wild-life importation laws in the United States and that's a GOOD thing. But, when you're actually trying to do something like this, it can be a very complicated procedure, the paperwork alone, the different languages that people speak, as I said, um, it's quite an ordeal, and one of the coolest things about these twenty five lions is that a couple of them are-had been living in prides already, under these circus conditions, so they'll be together. As soon as the first lion moved, we were moving three brothers and a sister, and they've been together their whole lives, and the transition was actually very smooth, and we believe [it's because] we didn't separate them for the entire journey. And so these guys will all go together and the few that didn't know each other have had a chance to get to know each other, in the last couple of months in the temporary compound, which we're very grateful to Mayor Hernandez in Santa Cruz for providing the space for; a large, temporary compound for twenty-five lions! (laughs)\n\nPITC: Uh, yeah! (laughs)\n\nJF: That came from Bolivia, and they'll be bidding them farewell, so, um, it's gonna be amazing, I mean the wild animal sanctuary in Colorado is a remarkable place, uh, they have three hundred acres and these animals, you know, most of them have never stepped on grass, they've never had a pond or a lake to swim around in, their lives will be *drastically *different in a couple of weeks for the better.\n\nPITC: Jorja, can you tell us one more time how our listeners can help, you know, basically really make this a great happy ending and a great new home for the lions?\n\nJF: Yes, please! If you're inspired or moved, you can go directly to the savethelionsappeal.com or adiusa.org- there will be a link to their site- ADI, also, I believe will be hosting video diaries if you want to find out more or learn more about these lions. They are endangered and they're incredibly majestic animals, and I think that we need them, and they deserve a nice place to live.\n\n*PITC: *And so we'll be in touch with you hopefully, you know, in a week or two, and see what's going on?\n\nJF: Oh, I'd love that!\n\n*PITC: *Okay!\n\nJF: Yeah, follow up, that'd be great!\n\n*PITC: *Fantastic! Jorja, we really appreciate you visiting with us today, thank you.\n\n*JF: *Oh Diane, thank you so much!\n\nPITC: That was very cool. I really hope that you guys got some good dish from CSI Las Vegas from, of course, the wonderful Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle, and we're gonna check in with her again and see how the lions are doing. We will put all the information she had spoken about how you can help the lions settle in at their new home, up on our Pets In The City On PetLife Radio website, so check that out after you listen.

Take a look.\n\n\"(clip from CSI)\"\n\nJulie: Please welcome Jorja Fox.\n\nJorja Fox: (walks in, waves to audience) Oh wow! (hugs hosts, sits down on the couch with Julie Chen, Sharon Osbourne and Sara Gilbert) I am so honored to be here, thanks for having me...\n\nJulie: Oh, we're honored to have you.\n\nJorja: ...I really am.\n\nSara Gilbert: So are you a good tipper?\n\nJorja: Oh my goodness. You know, I think that we all would like to think that we're really good tippers (laughs) you know? I did work in the service industry for quite a while in New York, before I was (airquotes) &#8216;acting full time', and so yeah, I do try to tip generously, even if the service is horrible. (laughs)\n\nSara: And get attention for it, like Leah [Remini]?\n\nJorja: (nods) Yep. (laughs) That's possible, yeah.\n\nJulie: What's generously? Because like I'm straight-forward 20% cause it's a little more than 15 and the math is easy, but I find that-\n\nJorja: The math is easy. (gestures at Julie)\n\nJulie: -the math is easy.\n\nJorja: That's an important-\n\nJulie: -but if I'm with someone who like, I see is looking at, you know, when you're doing the math, they're just looking, I ntip up because I want them to think I'm more generous than I am.\n\nJorja: (laughs) No.\n\nJulie: -I'm like, &#8216;yeah, throw on another ten bucks'. Isn't that terrible? So what do you do? Do you do, what, the 20%?\n\nJorja: Yeah, usually a minimum of 20. Even if it's a big group, you know, with 18 [percent] included.\n\nSharon Osbourne: So many of us, especially in the industry that we're in now, we all started serving.\n\nJorja: (nods) Mm-hm.\n\nSharon: I mean, I did. And didn't do very well at it.\n\nJorja: Me either. (laughs at herself)\n\nSharon: But I always feel, I always feel bad because people think it's just an easy job, and it isn't. It's a very difficult job to do it well.\n\nJorja: Absolutely.\n\nSharon: It's tough to be able to serve well.\n\nJorja: (gestures) And I think in Los Angeles, honestly, sometimes the service isn't so great, because people really are, their passion is something else.\n\nSharon: Yeah.\n\nJorja: And they're working to be a writer (ticks things off on her fingers), to be an actor,-\n\nSharon: Yeah.\n\nJorja: -to be a musician. So often yeah, you're, you, you don't necessarily have the best service you've ever had in your whole life, but at the same time, I like supporting the arts-\n\nSharon: Me too.\n\nJorja: -so I tip. (laughs)\n\nJulie: You, um, so you worked in the service industry, but were you a child actor, because you are such a wonderful actress.\n\nJorja: (smiles) Oh, that's so nice of you. Um, thank you.\n\n(audience applause)\n\nJulie: What were you like as a child?\n\nJorja: Um, the time. I knew I wanted to be an actor when I was five, and I, I grew up in a very very small coastal town in Florida, so, and, and every once in a while I think to myself, &#8216;well, I'm living my life based (gestures with her hands) on a decision I made when I was five' which is all so (gestures again) kind of interesting, I mean I-\n\nSara: Me too.\n\nJorja: -Yeah, yeah.-\n\nSara. It's weird.\n\nJorja: Like, &#8216;oh, okay, should I rethink that' but, you know, 'cause acting's not really a grown-up job, I think, I play make-believe for a living, but, it's so rewarding still, I, I kinda decided y'know as long as this is fun for me, I'm gonna keep doing it. But, I was a chubby kid, um, my mom was a parent of the Depression, and to her, a, a great way to love her kids was to feed her kids, so I ate five times a day. And this was, uh, like late 70's, early 80's so I don't know if you remember, they, there was a really popular t-shirt called &#8216;Foxy Lady' that everybody was wearing, you know the one, everybody wore one-\n\nJulie: Kind of.\n\nJorja: Yeah. And my mom bought one for every day of the week, 'cause she thought this was amazing, 'cause my last name was Fox, and I was sent off to school in these &#8216;Foxy Lady' t-shirts-\n\n(laughter from audience)\n\nSara, Julie: Ohhhh...\n\nJorja: I learned some humility real, really young.\n\nSara: But then it all turned around, right, because you became a model...\n\nJorja: Weird.\n\nSara: Right.\n\nSharon: No, not with those legs it ain't, missy. Those...\n\nJorja: Thank you.\n\nSara: No, it's not weird now.\n\nJorja: I went to... we had built a mall in this small town, probably, you know, a couple of years, you know, I was about 14 when this mall showed up. So I'm about fifteen and a half, and my mother told me I was hanging with the wrong circle of friends, I can't, I'm not to hang out with them any more, they were older than me, and they had cars, and we would go places that were a little further than my mother wanted me to go. So I arranged to meet these friends at the mall to say goodbye, to have a very dramatic goodbye with them, and I had been crying all morning, and, there was a modeling contest at the mall. It was the last thing that I wanted to do, but of course my friends were very fashion-forward and really cool, they're like, &#8216;well let's, you know, I know we're saying goodbye to you, but let's just join the modeling contest', and oddly, weirdly, strangely, I won. And again, you know, growing up in Florida in a small town, sort of the idea - you, you described this earlier (looking at Sharon) - what was beautiful in Florida was blonde, tanned,-\n\nSharon: Mm-hmm.\n\nJorja: -you know I was none of those things, I mean, um, obviously I'm very fair-skinned, I'm taller than most of the men even in Los Angeles, forget about the women-\n\n(audience laughs)\n\nSharon: Most of the men I date, anyway.\n\nJorja: Some of them, yes. And, yeah, so winning this contest was the, the greatest fluke that ever happened to me, and my face was in the *paper/e,, and the kids at school were like (covers her mouth briefly) &#8216;okay, chubby, Foxy Lady girl won the modeling contest?'. Like-/p \n\nSharon: Never.\n\nJorja: Oh yeah.\n\nJulie: We'll have more with Jorja Fox when we come right back.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nJulie: Oh, we're on this camera - sorry. Maybe I should do television sometime. Hah hah. Welcome back to \"The Talk\", we're having a conversation with Jorja Fox. Hello, hello, hello.\n\nJorja: Hello, hello.\n\nSharon: I wanted to ask you about the work that you do with Bob Barker because you do a lot of work for animal advo-\n\nJorja: Ahhh.\n\nSara: Advocacy.\n\nSharon: Thank you.\n\nJorja: That's a tough one, right?\n\nSharon: I can't get it, I can never get it out.\n\nJorja: Um, I had the honor and pleasure of working with Bob this spring-\n\nSharon: He is amazing.\n\nJorja: He is. He is a force to be reckoned with. And he funded the transport of 25 lions from Bolivia, ex-circus lions, to a wildlife sanctuary north of Denver, Colorado. This has never been done before, 25 lions have never gotten on a plane and, and been taken somewhere else-\n\nSharon: Wow.\n\nJorja: -in connection with an organization called ADI. And basically, Bolivia outlawed their travelling circuses, which is a thing that's sort of happening all over the world, and they didn't have the infrastructure afterwards to, to provide sort of decent, compassionate homes for these animals. So the wildlife animal sanctuary in Colorado took all 25 of them, and now they have 80 acres to share-\n\n(audience cheers, applauds)\n\nSharon: That must give you tremendous satisfaction.\n\nJorja: You know, on a personal level it really does, and then, you know, it stems, like I'm an environmentalist, I care about the planet, and, and these great land mammals that we have are, are falling off the planet at a very fast, fast pace, and... so for me my commitment is habitat for them, to keep the wild places wild, and the animals that are in captivity that we already have, let's take good care of them, I think they deserve it. So...\n\nJulie: What I, actually, but what I also hear about you is that you love to play games. (Jorja smiles) So we have a little game for you.\n\nJorja: Uh-oh.\n\nJulie: You have to get up and switch seats with me.\n\nJorja: All right.\n\nJulie: Okay.\n\n(they switch seats)\n\nJorja: Very exciting.\n\nJulie: This is a little game that we call &#8216;Jorja On My Mind'.\n\n(audience applause)\n\nJulie: (hands Jorja a red headband)\n\nJorja: Any game that involves a headband, something I'm excited about.\n\nJulie: Put the headband on with the velcro facing out and here's how it works.\n\nJorja: (puts on the headband, straightens her hair)\n\nJulie: I have a stack of cards-\n\nJorja: I do uh, all [Jimmy] Fallon or Bjork style?\n\nSara: Yeah, yeah.\n\nJorja: Cool. (makes a funny face)\n\nSara: Wait, pull the hair down a little...\n\nJorja: Pull it down a little? (adjusts her hair)\n\nSara: The hair, there we go.\n\n(Jorja and Sara laugh)\n\nJulie: This stack of cards is a picture of a celebrity. We're going to give you clues as to who you're wearing on your forehead, and-\n\nJorja: Uh-huh.\n\nJulie: -and like you, Jorja Fox, they too have the name of an animal in their name, but it might be the first name. Okay, it doesn't have to be the last name.\n\nJorja: Okay.\n\nJulie: But it could be, either-or.\n\nJorja: Can I get hints from the audience?\n\nJulie: No.\n\n(audience &#8216;awwws', Jorja looks around)\n\nSharon: No.\n\nJulie: No, you only get hints, we're going to take turns giving you hints,\n\nJorja: Okay.\n\nJulie: If you don't want one, you can pass and we'll go on to the next one.\n\nJorja: Okay.\n\nJulie: Okay, and if you get five right in 45 seconds, everyone in the audience goes home with a \"Talk\" t-shirt (holds up the t-shirt).\n\n(audience applause)\n\nJulie: 45 seconds on the clock, please!\n\nJorja: No pressure there...\n\nJulie: The most famous golfer in the world, cheated on his wife.\n\nJorja: Tiger Woods.\n\nJulie: Allegedly!\n\nJulie: Go, Sharon.\n\nSharon: Singer, songwriter, beautiful, blonde...\n\nJorja: Male, female?\n\nSharon: Gorgeous blonde lady!\n\nJorja: Okay.\n\nSharon: Gorgeous!\n\nSara: If it makes you happy.\n\nJorja: Sheryl Crow!\n\nJulie: Sara, go!\n\nSara: Okay, he's a singer married to Heidi Klum, it's on a rose, an animal...\n\nJorja: Oh, Seal!\n\nJulie: Okay, the most famous Tibetan monk.\n\nJorja: Dalai Lama.\n\n(audience starts counting down the clock)\n\nSharon: You're good at this! She thinks she's Angelina Jolie.\n\nSara: Married to Brian Austin Greene.\n\n(clock counts down to zero)\n\nSara: She once transformed into each other- (buzzer sounds)\n\nJorja: (makes a face) Augh!\n\nJulie: She has the same last name as you.\n\nJorja: Megan Fox.\n\nJulie: You know what, everyone goes home with a t-shirt! (Julie and Jorja hug; Jorja bangs into Julie's chin) Jorja Fox!\n\nJulie: You can see \"CSI\" every Thursday night at 9 o'clock right here on CBS. We'll be right back.\n\n(as the camera cuts away, Julie points to her chin)\n\nJorja: I'm so sorry about that.\n\n[...]  \n",

        "content": "\nJorja Fox: Hello! Hi, I'm the one who's going to have to read everything, as Marg knows.\n\nMarg Helgenberger: It's what you do.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah. I'm so happy for you. I had the very good fortune of meeting Marg Helgenberger in July of 2000, just as we were embarking on what would prove to be one of the signature adventures of our lives. Over the course of these last twelve years, we've shared some of the best and most exciting times a person can have. It's been kind of like riding one of those magic carpet rides that you read about when you were a kid. We were blessed. We won the number one show in the world title again last year. There's been mountains of accolades, parties, trips, award nominations, awards, critical acclaim, magazine covers, games, museum exhibits, dolls, and there's been lots of very, very, hard work. Sometimes in the dark, or the cold, or the rain [laughter].\n\nThere's been loss, too. Loss of partnerships, both professional and personal. Loss of beloved pets, loss of our younger selves. And the toughest, of course, loss of loved ones along the way. Through it all, Marg's been an unshakable rock, a fearless leader, a devoted cheerleader, and very often the brains of our operations. Marg sets the bar sky scraper high for the rest of us, without making us feel small. She can wade through a landfill in the morning, and slip into an evening gown by dinner time without missing a single beat. She's tough as nails, smooth as silk, easy like Sunday morning, and steady as she goes.\n\nI think she's touched every single person she's met along the way. She's generous, she's giving, and she's an amazing listener, wether she's hanging with old coast executives at a swanky event or hanging out in a ditch somewhere with our unseen, heroic, crew, or hanging out in a hospital with women who've been struck with breast cancer.\n\nNow, I know I don't have to tell you how talented Marg Helgenberger is. Her craftsmanship is legendary and very well documented. But I will gloat for a minute about getting to watch her perform on a daily basis. She lights up any corner of the world that she's in, and brings an authenticity and intimacy to every scene that she does that is simply dazzling to watch. Speaking for your CSI tribe today, and there are many of us that are here. Give yourselves a shout out! We love you. We're SO going to miss working with you in the near future. And we wish you the absolute best going forward at everything you do. I, for one, am willing to wager a large, Vegas, bet that this is just Marg's Professional Halftime Show. After all, you do have to stop and smell the roses.\n\nWe have a pretty epic football pool at work. When the guys need help with their picks, Marg is the first person that they ask. Marg's also the first person the guys ask to dance at our seasonal parties. Marg is an... anomaly. She's a broad, she's a dame, and she's a lady. And I am very proud to call her my friend.\n\nCongrats, Marg, Hollywood Boulevard's going to shine even brighter tonight, now that you are a fixture on the scene.\n\n[...]",

        "content": "\nMonica Gleberman .. and just ask you, how did you get involved in acting to begin with?\n\nJorja Fox Oh my goodness. I wanted to act since I was probably four or five years old. I think that the television that sat in the living room of my house was one of the bigger influences in my life. It was definitely a babysitter for me. You know, I grew up in a small town, so there weren't many acting programs. And it was high school before I was able to be in a drama class. I think there were two things that happened. First of all I love it so much, and then second of all, people were really supportive of me, and doing acting. I think I had a lot of support doing it, and so there was no doubt in my mind. I went to New York and got lucky. I got in [something] very quickly because I ignored all these signs that said \"Do Not Enter.\" [laughter] I didn't have an agency, you know &#8216;Don't go beyond this point.' And I sort of ignored all of those signs that told me not to go further and landed up in an agency, and I was able to have a conversation with my agency and I had an audition, and they started sending me out. It was so processed. But definitely I started my career in New York and was there for probably seven years before ending up in Los Angeles.\n\nMonica I have followed your career, and of course I did research before this. You have had some major television show lucky jobs. Some of the biggest shows known to man. So I want to ask you, of course you were on ER, you were on The West Wing. What was it like- I know when you're on it, you might not think &#8216;This is huge' and might not realize how big it is. But looking back, reflecting back on your appearances, what does that feel like? To look back and note that you were on these two shows that are probably going down in history as some of the best television?\n\nJorja Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. ER in particular because I started on ER in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. And less appointment television. I don't know if you remember, but people had to actually turn on the TV at the right time. VCR's existed but even then, people wanted to a lot of the bigger shows live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. Even though I hadnât watched ER, it was my momâs favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like in a week or two's time, everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor. That I was just claiming to be an actor and I was terrible. So I came really close to just driving to Mexico the week before I started and forgetting the whole thing. But I'm glad I didn't. I always felt it was a pretty incredible learning experience, to get to spend time with that caliber of people every day, writers and actors and BPs(?) and directors. \n\nAnd absolutely the same goes for West Wing. I think West Wing... I was a huge fan then, of Sorkin, and ER and West Wing had a number of the same producers. I think the thing that surprised me the most for myself was I could get to be a part of telling a wonderful story like that. It was something that I hadn't even dreamed of. I just felt like it was such an honor to get to try and tell that story. I really like looked after Martin Sheen's daughter. I couldn't believe it! I got to do something like that! I think that Sorkin, he said at the time on West Wing, he's alone, and there had been very few women Secret Service Agents at that time, that had actually been on screen. Even getting to be that, getting to be this female Secret Service Agent was kind of a lot of fun that people hadn't gotten to do.\n\nMonica And I know, obviously, you've done a ton of movies and other TV shows, and then you land CSI. Which, again, another- it's like crazy, your career, because it's another huge show! So I want to go back to Season one, and what that was like, finding out you're going to be playing Sara, and where your mind was when you got that call. \n\nJorja Um. That was also a big surprise. I really didnât think that CSI was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was something that was pretty different and something that I hadnât really read about often. You know, Quincy was sort of the thing that I could think of that sort of reminded me a little of CSI. And I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night, that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do. I was so wrong about that. I really thought I would do CSI, have some fun and be back on The West Wing by Christmas. You know, that's what I thought was going to happen! I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later. And it was just this monster. Not &#8212; I guess monster's kind of &#8212; this behemoth that none of us expected. I think that nobody could have imagined how big the ride was going to get. \n\nAnd thank you for saying that! I'm actually starting my eighteenth consecutive season in a row on Prime Time television. It's big for me.\n\nMonica I know! It's crazy!\n\nJorja So thanks for talking about that stuff.\n\nMonica I want to ask- so were you surprised &#8212; before we get into Sara and where she's gone over the course of- and now we're in- there's gonna be a fourteenth season. I want to ask you, I know that in 2007 you had announced that you were leaving the show. Were you surprised at how many fans freaked out and started sending in gifts and money and started a campaign to try to keep you on CSI? Was that shocking to you at how many people cared about this character?\n\nJorja Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. It was one of the most magnificent experiences. I had no idea there would be that kind of a response. Truthfully, that was my season twelve in a row, and I was tired. I was just thinking &#8216;Oh my god, I just need to lie down for a minute.' I just needed to kind of sit down and reground. So I wanted to get off-screen before it started to show on screen, or before my coworkers started to notice. It was an amazing show of support, and I wished I could have changed my mind to show the fans the amount of gratitude I had for them suggesting that I stay. Honestly, if I wasn't so exhausted, I absolutely would have. So yeah, it was an amazing feeling of surprise.\n\nMonica So now that you're back, and you've been back for a while, everyone's been super excited. I want to know from you how has Sara changed from season one, I know she's had a lot of life changes with the proposal and getting married, but how has she changed from season one to season thirteen?\n\nJorja It's funny. I think in some ways she really hasnât changed that much [laughs]. There's been some seemingly big changes. When we met Sara in 2000, if anything I think she was very much a product of her past and of her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be a CSI that definitely stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7, and was gone most of season 8, she had a chance to really wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself. \n\nAnd yet, here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character, who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested, but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of the way I've been playing the character for the last couple of season. And yet at the same time, now we are in season fourteen, I do feel that Sara- there is this compulsive drive, something very deep rooted. She can't stop being a CSI, it's what fuels her, maybe the duration of her life, she's going to be there in the trenches, on the street, in the muck, in the darkness, trying to get justice for people. I'm looking at it again, myself, and like \"huh!\" I thought the compulsive side of her was finished, and now maybe it's not, not at all. Maybe she's just the same.\n\nMonica What can fans look forward to this season? What kind of cases? What are you guys going to get involved with, cause there's always a craziness happening every episode. So what can fans expect this season for the upcoming episodes?\n\nJorja I think so far &#8212; we are in the middle of episode 7 and I've seen the script for eight, and I think we have an amazing season opening up. Really exciting. We have some incredible guest stars including somebody likeâ¦ oh you know what I donât know if I could say cause I don't know if I'm a spoiler alert. [laughs] We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff â I think the writers this year again, they suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper. \n\nIt's going to be a darker season of CSI, but within that also there's going to be as much character stuff as there was last year. I think they're continuing to write a lot of character stuff, which is great. Certainly we start the season with Morgan in jeopardy, the stakes are really high. We also start the season with a funeral and itâs not really until we get to the end of the show that you, the audience, will come to find out why we're at the funeral and who has passed. Itâs a very compelling kind of suspenseful episode.\n\nYou know, yeah it gets crazier every year. I don't know how the writers come up with stuff in season fourteen. The unfortunate thing is there's no shortage of crazy crime in America to draw from. But the stakes continue to get higher, and I hope the fans will continue to enjoy that. I always am partial to the action/adventure show. And so in those episodes where we get a little kooky, hopefully the fans will still be able to roll with us.\n\nMonica I wanted to ask you, was it nice that all current cast members continued on for season fourteen? \n\nJorja Absolutely! Because we have had so many changes. You know, part of me, you were speaking about ER, ER began to lose their core cast members in season three. So the fact that our show made it to season seven with the core cast intact, I think is a testament to the show and a compliment to how much we actually did get along and liked working together and did like the work itself. I think very few shows have gone seven seasons retaining their full original cast.\n\nBut yes, it's been really nice to have a cast that's been able to stay together for a couple of seasons. You can't fake chemistry. You've sort of got to build it organically. The more you know each other, the more you work together, the deeper you can go. It's given a chance for that. I think it's been kind of a really great thing for the writers, because there were a lot of seasons where it was really hard for them to start breaking stories over the summer, because they weren't completely sure who their cast was going to be. Knowing early enough that they were going to have everyone has allowed them to spread their wings more than they could for a bunch of season. \n\nThis team, this troupe of actors, you never think that &#8216;Wow, three new actors in practically one season. This is definitely- this can't go well. This is going to be difficult.' And to love these three actors as much as I do, as much as we all do, we're having so much fun every day. I hope it shows on screen. As usual, I'm just grateful I get to come here and hang out, because it's a really fun place to be.\n\nMonica Of course I have to ask too, season fourteen, will mark the 300th episode, which is like, nuts. So what is that? What have you guys, I think it's like mid-season, right? The 300th?\n\nJorja The 300th? Episode five. We're pretty soon, like pretty pretty soon. We're going to do ten new shows in a row. I don't think we've done that before. And so, yeah, I think five weeks after the premiere tomorrow, you'll be able to see the 300th episode.\n\nMonica So what is that like? Being a part of ... I feel like a lot of this interview is about you being a part of these crazy, amazing, genius shows. And not only do you have this awesome career, but you're a part of another benchmark, which is the 300th episode. So what is that like, being a part of?\n\nJorja It was such an honor for me. You know, it is a milestone. I didn't think much about it going in, but then we all showed up for work the first day, and a couple people gave speeches, and I started to feel the gravity of it all. I think it's been a great second chance for me. I missed the 200th episode, I wasn't here. I was here for the 100th episode. And to get to be a part of the 300th episode meant a lot to me. More than I even imagined it would. I haven't done 300 episodes yet, I'm behind several members of the cast because I did take that season off, and I don't appear in every episode every year. I think with my combined with my ER and West Wing I might be on episode 296 or something. I can share that.\n\nIt's funny, because ER went 300 episodes, and Marg Helgenberger, George Eads and myself had all had parts on ER, so with another show that the three of us can be happy for and be a part of this tiny piece of ER history. Of course, the history that we have on CSI is a lot deeper and bigger. It's really cool. I don't think it's ever going to happen to me again, to be a part of something like this. I don't know if it's going to be possible for a lot of shows to get to do this. Most shows are doing 13 episodes a year instead of 24, which is what we started out with. It takes a long time doing 13 episodes a season to get to 300 episodes. I think this is kind of a marker we may not see that much of in the future. It meant a lot and I'm really proud of- for everyone. I'm really proud of everyone and just very excited to get to be a part of it. It's cool.\n\nMonica I want to ask, and I know it could be a little spoiler, but in the 300th episode, I've heard rumors there might be some flash backs? Is that...\n\nJorja Ah yes. Flashbacks slash faux-backs. [laughs] That's what we're calling them. We did out best. It has been thirteen years. [laughs] Thirteen meaningful years. But it was truly fun and embarrassing and silly to try and do it- I hope we pulled it off. I hope the fans enjoy it. There's- You know it's not a huge chunk of the show, but three flashbacks. Four I think! We go back to 2000. There's some funny clothes, and funny hairstyles. I threw in a wig. And it's great. We do, we're- the episode is really about a cold case from 2000, that has certainly haunted Sara for the last thirteen years. And I think it, within the show, Sara feels a certain exuberance at having a second chance at a case she thought had really slipped through her fingers. \n\nSo not only did I get a second chance to be a part of something so exciting, but she's getting a second chance to really try and find justice for somebody who's living a nightmare several times.\n\nMonica Is there anything else you want to tell to the fans who are super excited &#8212; they're counting down the hours to the premiere. Is there anything you want to say to them? Anything about the season or just in general that you want them to know?\n\nJorja I think yes. I wanna say to all the fans of CSI, thank you so much! Thank you thank you thank you thank you for your support all these years. We are continually surprised and completely elated that we get ratings every years, that we continue to get to be on this show and do these things, that's all because of you. Thank you for your loyalty and your willingness to go on some really crazy rides with us. I hope this year we don't disappoint you and we're really excited to show you what we have coming up.\n\nMonica Okay! Great! Those were all my questions.\n\nJorja Thank you so much, Monica, it was great speaking with you.\n\n",

        "content": "\nThea Andrews: Oh dear! Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, seems to be in some hot water tonight on CSI\n\nKevin Fraizer: Jorja, welcome.\n\nJorja Fox: Hi.\n\nKevin Fraizer: And your character seems to be in a little bit of trouble. What's going on?\n\nJorja Fox: You know, I don't know what you're talking about. It's just a little misunderstanding! \n\nThea Andrews: What'd you get up to?\n\nJorja Fox: It gets completely blown out of proportion. You know, Sara's universe kind of implodes tonight. I'm nervous about it. I hope the fans enjoy it. It's a very scary, dark, terrible wormhole. \n\nThea Andrews: Kind of on the other side. They're looking for your DNA.\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah! It impacted me a lot deeper than I thought it would. I've done this for a long time with a lot of guest actors, with lots of different stories, and it was the first time in all- I'm looking at it differently now. If I have to process somebody, or if I'm interrogating someone, it's a hat that I wore for one night that I can't ever go back from. I think I have more empathy than I did. Which is kind of &#8212; My character's always had a lot of empathy in the show, and now I feel even more for people.\n\nThea Andrews: It is incredible when you think about it. That this is the most watched television show in the world.\n\nKevin Fraizer: In the world. \n\nThea Andrews: Not in America. In the world. In it's thirteenth season. You've been there since the very beginning. Give us some stats. How many murders have you solved?\n\nJorja Fox: Personally?\n\nKevin Fraizer: People have died a lot on your show.\n\nJorja Fox: That's an even scarier question. I think one of the &#8212; I have no idea how many murders we've solved. I think ... How many murders haven't we solved? That one I can probably answer. It's like six.\n\nThea Andrews: People are looking for new crazy kinds.\n\nJorja Fox: Six times we haven't-\n\nThea Andrews: Oh that you haven't gotten the-\n\nJorja Fox: That we haven't gotten our person, or that we've had a couple serial killers over the years and it's taken us a while to get. But we've been really lucky, we get most of them.\n\nKevin Fraizer: There's a bunch of versions of you around the world, by the way. Is is weird watching yourself, in like, Mandarin?\n\nJorja Fox: It's amazing. I'll see it and I'll like \"I'm so smart!\"\n\nThea Andrews: You just get to a hotel, you turn on a TV, and there you are.\n\nJorja Fox: It's weird to be fluent in almost every language on earth. Not me, but the version of me. Sara is fluent in pretty much every language on earth. That's a huge compliment. It's really cool.\n\nThea Andrews: You're also fluent in many genres of this business. Because you're also producing an off-Broadway play right now. What's it like to put that hat on?\n\nJorja Fox: It's been a huge learning experience. The show is [[Forever Dusty]] and it's an off-Broadway musical in New York. Obviously musicals are a complete left turn for me, I come from, I like to think, comedy and drama, but more drama. That scene you just played is actually the funniest scene in the whole episode. It's been fascinating. New York City is my home town, and I've always wanted to do a project there. We're really proud of it. It's funny and beautiful and deep. It's about the singer, Dusty Springfield, so if you like her music, it's all you need, you're gonna have a great time there. \n\nKevin Fraizer: Why are people still obsessed with William Petersen, and the fact that there could've, would've, should've been something... what is the fascination-\n\nJorja Fox: You mean my husband? My television husband? Yeah, cause Sara and Grissom are... Well. He's been a little disracted lately, and it has been really interesting. I think I've done the show three seasons now without him, and never imagined I'd possible-\n\nKevin Fraizer: That's the thing. People are still like \"Well? Well? What's going to happen?\"\n\nJorja Fox: All roads lead to Grissom. From the beginning, middle and end of this show, I think that always our protagonist, the person that the audience- We followed through his eyes. And I think it's a tremendous compliment, and it's still true today, that we kind of are still following the whole story through his eyes.\n\nKevin Fraizer: Will he ever come back?\n\nJorja Fox: I would love to answer that question, but I'm not gonna.\n\nKevin Fraizer: I like that you know something! I love that! People come here, and they know stuff, and they're all \"Ha ha! Can't tell you.\" \n\nJorja Fox: Yep, just a little Cheshire Cat. But there will be some Sara and Grissom information in the episode tonight.\n\nThea Andrews: Oh, I thought \"Sara information\" &#8212; \n\nKevin Fraizer: William Peterson's gonna pop on! He's going to be there!\n\nThea Andrews: Well thank you. Thirteen seasons, going strong, congratulations. \n\n[...]",

        "content": "\n[...]\n\nJane Velez-Mitchell: CSI star Jorja Fox plays a determined crime scene investigator, who won't let anything stand in her pursuit of the truth. When she's off the set, she's just as determined to free animals from captivity. I talked to Jorja about why she thinks Blackfish is a giant step for all animals in captivity.\n\n[Clip of CSI]\n\nJane Velez-Mitchell: Jorja Fox, you play Sara Sidle on CSI and you do such a great job of investigating. In this movie, Blackfish, the director describes it as an investigation into what lies below the surface. Do you relate to that?\n\nJorja Fox: Absolutely, and I'm so very thrilled that this documentary is out there and it's going to be televised. I think that this is an issue that people are really going to respond to in a powerful, powerful way. And it's a story whose time has come.\n\nJane Velez-Mitchell: So when Sea World says \"Hey, we're the leaders in animal husbandry, we're breeding these orcas in captivity.\" is that a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?\n\nJorja Fox: It's a bad thing, in my opinion. And it's a pointless thing, in my opinion. It's absolutely pointless. These animals live really long lives, sometimes, if they're lucky, they live shorter lives. A life in captivity, for a wild marine mammal, is a life of suffering and misery and loneliness. It goes against every innate desire that they have.\n\n[Clip of the movie]\n\nJorja Fox: A good number of these captive orcas and killer whales were rounded up in a certain time in history. We have watched these pods in the wild for many years. We know where most of these orcas and killer whales, we know where their families are, we know where their pods are &#8212;\n\nJane Velez-Mitchell: So you endorse what Russell Simmons suggested? Change it radically, eliminate the performance of the orcas or shut down?\n\nJorja Fox: I think the future that we're looking at, if these animals can't be released into the wild, then we can do much better by them. I'm talking about sanctuaries, I'm talking about ecological preserves, marine preserves, where these animals can live out their lives in somewhat more of a normal way. My first and foremost idea would be lets release as many of these animals as we can into the wild, and lets take the risk and see what happens. \n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  \n",

        "content": "\nIntroduction\n\nAnnouncer: Please, before we start anything, give a big hand to Pacific Sun, who is responsible for letting Lion Ark be here today.  The film is co-presented by Animal Defenders International, which had, obviously you'll see, an integral part in the creation of Lion Ark. We're very happy to have this film, it's a powerful film, it's an exciting film. It's going to subvert a lot of your expectations about both seeing a documentary and about some of the assumptions we had growing up or seeing in our culture. I think it's going to be a really successful event today. Please give a warm welcome to an ambassador for Animal Defenders International, and also the associate producer, Jorja Fox. \n\nJorja Fox: Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone, [Light laughter] and welcome to the North American premiere of Lion Ark.  Very exciting day for us. On behalf of the filmmakers, Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, we want to humbly thank the Mill Valley Film Festival for having us at this incredible event. And we also want to thank you very much for coming out to see the movie. \n\nBeing a part of Lion Ark has been an epic adventure for me, and today is no exception. I'm thrilled to get to watch all of you watch the movie. It's very fitting for Lion Ark that we're premiering here, as it's the first place the first group of lions landed from Bolivia, back in the spring of 2010. Those four lions are living in the PAWS Sanctuary, near [Gulf(?)], California. Moving lions on airplanes is kind of a strange and rare thing. And the city of San Francisco, San Francisco International Airport and the surrounding areas were so very kind to us and welcomed us with a very serene calm and gracious resolve. We're very grateful for that.  Lion Ark&8216;s biggest stars, the main stars of the movie, lions, of course couldn't be here today. They're tired from their life in show business. But many of the key human players are here. They've traveled far and wide, from the United Kingdom to South America. \n\nWe are having a Q&A immediately after the film, and I very much hope you'll stick around for questions and comments, and to hear from this amazing and diverse group of people who are all experts in their fields. We're also having a party tonight, a bit of a fundraiser for the next chapter of Lion Ark. We cordially invite all of you to come. It's going to be at Bungalow 44 at six o'clock. You can see anyone in the black Lion Ark t-shirts with clipboards for tickets, and tickets will also be available at the door if we don't sell out. Tickets are $70. As I mentioned, it's a fundraiser. You'll get drinks and appetizers, and a chance to mingle with the filmmakers and the rescue team. We hope to see all of you there.\n\nLastly, and I'll be brief, I just want to talk about the film makers. Jane Creamer and Tim Phillips for a minute. Jan and Tim have been working absolutely tirelessly for over thirty years for the betterment of wild and domesticated animals alike, across the globe. They run an organization called Animal Defenders International. This wonderful film that you're about to see highlights just one of their campaigns. Needless to say, they lead very exciting lives. From bustling cities to the most barren and remote landscapes, Jan and Tim have a knack for making friends and allies wherever they go. They're bridge builders, of a sort. Metaphoric bridge building is a very rare skill, a very special skill. I think it's a skill that's sorely lacking in most fields in the landscape today. And I think that it is the Golden Key to finding solutions for our planets' issues.\n\nAnimal Defenders International works from private support. They depend on private support for the work that they do. If you feel inspired by this film, and I think you will, please offer up your own support, be it a donation, spreading the world, or volunteering, or all of the above. It's ADI's greatest hope &#8212; sorry, forgot to change my page [Jorja laughs at herself] &#8212; It's ADI's greatest hope to give as many animals as possible, out in the world, a happy ending.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Lion Ark. Thank you.\n\n&#8212;-\n\nQ&A\n\n[Asked how they got involved]\n\nJorja Fox: I think I was lucky I grew up in a very small town in Florida. My grandmother was very influential in my life. She was a rabid environmentalist, and kind of a modern thinker on a lot of levels, and I took after her quite a bit. I think I also &8212; it was also the '80s, and it was music videos and it was new media and there were a couple kids in my school, eccentric kids in my school, who were vegetarians and would talk about that stuff. It kind of opened a door for me to learn as much as I could. I had a lot to do with books at that time too. I think it's amazing, in the few short years since the '80s, how far some of these ideas have come. I really do think we're reaching a tipping point with animals and entertainment and circuses and zoos. There's better options. There's PAWS and the Wild Animal Sanctuary and I think we're starting to get those ideas, and I think we're going to see some really positive changes over the next ten, fifteen, years. Maybe we'll be thinking that's really a thing of the past, it's really not that cool to see an animal in a cage do a trick, like roll a ball or whatever. There's far cool things they can do.\n\n[How do they get all these animals in circuses?]\n\nJorja Fox: You (Jan Creamer) kind of just said what I was going to say. Most of it, especially in the United States, all comes from breeding programs. The animals are here. It's actually very difficult now to get them across International borders. People do it, sometimes for the right reasons, and sometimes not. I think there's a whole bunch of animals up at PAWS that started out in somebody's basement. They bought it on a black market, it was a pet for a time, and then it got too big, too strong, and they had to figure out what to do with it.\n\n&#8212;-\n\nPost Screening\n\nJorja Fox: You know, I love the film so much. And I've really only seen it finished twice, so today was my second time. I was moved a little more than I wanted to be, 'cause I was in this public theater with a lot of people. I wanted to be so very cool and calm and collected. It was a thrill and a half. It was amazing. We're so happy to be here at the Mill Valley Festival. We want to thank everybody or having us.\n\nInterviewer: [unintelligible question]\n\nJorja Fox: Yeah, I think so. Not too many people left early, so that's always a really good sign. I do, I kind of see the film as an action/adventure piece. It is a documentary, and it's real events, but to me there's a lot of hair-raising, edge-of-your-seats moments, and yes, I think the audience very much stayed with us for the film.\n\nInterviewer: [unintelligible question]\n\nJorja Fox: Why did I have to make it? I think I was lucky to get to be a part of the film. The events, moving the lions from Bolivia to the United States a couple years ago, I got to be a part of that move, and at the time I remember somebody saying \"Oh yeah, we're documenting this.\" and we all had mics on. I was just really thrilled to get to be a part of it. It was, I think, an epic accomplishment to move 28 lions 48,000 miles to a sanctuary. I really wasn't sure that it could be done, that it could be pulled off. Certainly there would be some hitch somewhere along the way. You know, it's funny. For a movie that's so exciting, so much of the work that went into the actual move was so slow, and meticulous and methodical, including securing these laws on traveling circuses throughout the world. It's very tedious work. It was a miracle that it all came together.\n\nInterviewer: [unintelligible question]\n\nJorja Fox: It's Northern California, I love this part of the country, I come here often. I think that Mill Valley is a very peaceful place, it's a place that's very connected with the nature surrounding it. There's water everywhere, it's in the foothills and the redwoods. There's amazing surfing and sailing. So particularly, not only for this film, Lion Ark, I think it's a perfect match in terms of content in a place, but also for me as a person who's a surfer and an outdoor person, it's always good to be up here. I love the food here. I love the wine, I love the coffee. It's a really great place to visit, and I'm sure a great place to live. \n\n",

All 300.\n\nSara Gilbert: You've been there since the first season, but I heard, Jorja, that you didn't think the show was gonna take off.\n\nJorja Fox: No, and I can say that we're [Jorja and Eric] getting old. [laughter] I can't speak for you guys [Elisabeth and Ted] at all. When I see a grey hair on his [Eric's] head, I'm done. I'm out. That's when it's over. [group laughter] I though, \"Okay it's this show about death. It's gonna be on a Friday night. Death in the Western Hemisphere culture, not so much.\" I thought we were doomed. I thought we were gonna do six shows and we were canceled. I knew *I* loved it! And I still love it. It's weird... we're still here.\n\nAisha Tyler: That's awesome.\n\n[audience applause]\n\n[interview with Eric, Elisabeth, and Ted]\n\nJulie Chen: Now Jorja. The show is so serious, and you guys have such a great sense of humor, but it must get dark on the set at times because of the content. What do you do between takes to lighten the mood?\n\nJorja Fox: Well, as a matter of fact, we have one of the great funny men of all time on the show now: Mr. Ted Danson. [audience laughter and cheers] And he &#8212; he does some dancing. He was a competitive dancer, yeah, and many times, when it gets a little intense, you dance.\n\nTed Danson: You know what it is? My hips are going. I fall. [audience laughter] I sway and fall and it looks like a dance.\n\nJulie Chen: Are you gonna bust a move?\n\nAisha Tyler: Yeah! We were hoping that &#8212;\n\nJulie Chen: Come on, you've got to. One or two steps.\n\n[audience cheers this idea on]\n\nTed Danson: I'll dance, if Jorja &#8212; cause she does these funny things where she takes her clothes off-\n\n[The Talk ladies break into hysterics, Jorja laughs]\n\nJulie Chen: Fair is fair!\n\nJorja Fox: Not in these heels, they're not right for a dance.\n\nTed Danson: No no! I will, but you've got to [laughter]\n\nJulie Chen: We want to keep it PG here! Maybe later Ted will bust a move. [...]eros as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we'd know each other ten years. He's a master at intimacy. It's not forced, it's authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.' I've said this before, but I swear he's got wings on. Like under his jacket, there's wings. He is an amazing guy.\n\n[group &#8216;awwww' and applause]\n\nChen: Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there's one that's coming out later this year, and you're really proud of it. It's called \"How I Became An Elephant.\" Tell us about that.\n\nFox: Thank you for asking about that. It's a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It's really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you're from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person can make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it's a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live. \n\n[applause]\n\nFox: Thank you.\n\nChen: Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We'll be back.\n\n[...]  \n",

Take a look.\n\n[Clip from \"Sheltered\"]\n\nGilbert: Please welcome Jorja Fox!\n\nJorja Fox: ... two hour The Talk special today?\n\nJulie Chen: Oh yes, we're taking over the network. Two hour special, Affiliates take notice.\n\nFox: There's so much to talk about\n\nAisha Tyler: I know!\n\nChen: Well we were just talking about disastrous vacations, in light of Heidi Klum's son almost drowning in the ocean. Have you ever had a disastrous vacation?\n\nFox: You know, I had to really &#8212; I've had so many disastrous, I had sort of sit and think about which one I wanted to talk about. Nothing nearly as excited as yours [Sharon Osborne]. I am also prone to food poisoning on the road. My family went to Europe when I was 13, I went with my mom and my dad and my grandmother, who was in her y'know late seventies, eighties, at the time. And we take the train to Paris and, you guys have probably done this, there are several stops and we hit like &#8216;Paris North.' And the worst part is my family speaks French. So we put my grandmother on the platform and we're passing bags out, like twelve bags, and the train leaves. So not only do we leave my grandmother on the platform in Paris, but it's the wrong platform. It isn't even Paris.\n\nTyler: [laughing] Oh no!\n\nFox: It took about two and a half hours to circle back, go back an get her. My mom was in tears, she thought she was going to have a heart attack, she's all alone. But she was just kind of sitting on the bags with a cappuccino. Enjoying the day. [group laughter] Yeah, that's my favorite disaster.\n\nGilbert: Now, you actually had another experience in Europe, before you became an actress, when you were seventeen you moved to Italy, right? To try and be a model. \n\nFox: Yes, &#8216;try' is the operative word. \n\nGilbert: But how did that go? I heard you almost ended up homeless?\n\nFox: I don't know where you heard that rumor, but it's one of the true ones. You know, this is- My manager sent me with five-hundred dollars and said \"Take $500, you'll have plenty of money, you're going to start working right away with Seventeen.\" And I was partnered up with another model, who was all of 21, and she was going to be the smart one, you know, and sort of the savvy one. And we get there and she tells me she had two-hundred dollars, she didn't tell anyone she only had $200. We had $700, even in the 80s, in Europe, you're out of money pretty fast. We got kicked out of our pension and, quite honestly, a young American architectural student in Milan saved my life and let me live with him for five or six weeks, until- It was sort of the closet I ever experienced college dorm life, with a student in Milan.\n\nGilbert: And then you moved into one of those model &#8212;\n\nFox: Yeah, we got on our feet- We did start working. It took a little longer than we thought. And yeah, we moved into a model's pension, which was also like my &#8216;college' experience.\n\nGilbert: Right.\n\nFox: It happened to be a girls pension, a woman's pension and I was one of the youngest there. Women would sneak their boyfriends in several times a week, which was kind of fun. But one of the things I loved the most, and there was so much traveling at that age, you know everybody kind of looked after each other, but there were women there from all over the world, and young girls, and &#8212; All of them, we'd go out to dinner and you could be from Thailand, and maybe you're from Iceland, and you're from France, and everyone would speak in English together. Broken English. So the conversations were pretty simple &#8212; not because we were models &#8212; there was a launguage-\n\n[group laughter]\n\nTyler: You joined the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation very- in the year it debuted and- [applause] Yes, and I was on it!\n\nFox: Alma Mater!\n\nTyler: &#8212; And I loved working there. It was an incredible show. And it's so hard to believe that you're wrapping up the thirteenth season of the show. It's incredible for any actor to have a job for this long and to be so successful.\n\nFox: It doesn't happen! It just- You know when you go to acting school they prepare you. You know, \"You're going to go from job to job to job to job. It's just kind of the nature of the business.\" And so this is a complete anomoly. None of us are prepared for it.\n\nTyler: Does your kind of crime scene investigating skills from the show start to creep into your real life [laughter] after this long?\n\nFox: [faux dramatic] I know all the secrets of everyone here.\n\nSharon Osborne: Last season, Ted Danson joined the cast. And we love him in the show. He's such an amazing guy. I mean, it must be such a joy to work with him every day.\n\nFox: [deadpan] He's a terror. He's horrible. \n\n[group laughter]\n\nOsborne: He's naughty!\n\nFox: He's amazing. He's amazing! He's one of these gentlemen, you know he's been in the business for years, he's one of my heroes as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we'd know each other ten years. He's a master at intimacy. It's not forced, it's authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.' I've said this before, but I swear he's got wings on. Like under his jacket, there's wings. He is an amazing guy.\n\n[group &#8216;awwww' and applause]\n\nChen: Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there's one that's coming out later this year, and you're really proud of it. It's called \"How I Became An Elephant.\" Tell us about that.\n\nFox: Thank you for asking about that. It's a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It's really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you're from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person can make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it's a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live. \n\n[applause]\n\nFox: Thank you.\n\nChen: Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We'll be back.\n\n[...]  \n",

I'm representing Artists & Athletes tonight. I'm on the advisory board and we're a collective of artists and athletes that connect with Washington DC on issues that are close to everybody. Kind of create a dialogue between the different camps and bring us together to get things that we care about on the floor and up for conversation.\n\nTP: That's so important. Are you an athlete yourself?\n\nJF: I'm a surfer. I don't know if that really counts. \n\nTP: Of course that counts. [...] Do you have a green tip? Is there something that you could tell our viewers?\n\nJF: Okay, well I'm going out on the edge here, but I'd like to take \"Meatless Mondays\" into three more days a week. Probably the single-handed biggest thing that any individual can do to really help the environment is to eat vegetarian. And maybe not all the time, but even just more would make a huge difference.\n\nTP: That is a good one. So are you a vegetarian?\n\nJF: I am, yes.\n\nTP: How long have you been a vegetarian?\n\nJF: Like ... twenty-two years?\n\nTP: Wow! \n\nJF: Yeah like that. You know, for me it's something I don't even think about anymore. It's just... it's not complicated, it's not hard. [...] In terms of raising cattle and raising food, the water that gets used and the land that gets sort of clear-cut to make that happen... you don't think about that when- I mean, why would we?\n\nTP: I don't think people put faces to their food. How that works, where their food comes from. That is a great one, thank you for that tip. \n\nJF: Thanks Tiffany.\n\nTP: Have a great night.\n\nJF: Alright, you too.\n\n",

You are presenting, correct?\n\nJorja Fox: I am presenting best episodic series and best limited series, TV awards, which should be kind of fun.\n\nQM: Very cool. And you recently narrated a documentary, correct?\n\nJF: You know, I have actually. Thanks for knowing that! Actually a bit ago I narrated a documentary about Gidget. One of the first female surfers in California. I produced a couple of documentaries and most of those are wildlife based. Lion Ark, Extinction Soup, and How I Became an Elephant.\n\nQM: Awesome. Working in television and documentaries, what is the different process that you go through initially? \n\nJF: Entirely different process. Obviously usually with television you're dealing with a script- at least in my world! I'm not part of reality television or news television. And so you'll develop a script for a really long time and then hopefully somebody will be interested in it. And I think with documentaries, at least for me so far, someone has just had an idea and a camera and decided that they had a story that they needed to tell, and almost started the process of telling it without even knowing where it was going to end up, or what the results were going to be. Those are the projects that I've been a part of so far. I think there can be pre-production in documentaries. People sit down and they kind of scope it out. But so far ours have just sort of been like run and wing it.\n\nQM: Very cool. Do you plan on doing more in the future?\n\nJF: I hope so, yeah. I've been really enjoying it. It's a fun thing to do.\n\nQM: And then ... Robert Redford is being honored tonight. He's kind of been the founder of Sundance-\n\nJF: Do you see my boots shaking?\n\nQM: Are you a- Obviously you a fan, yes?\n\nJF: Yes. You know, I think everybody has a couple heroes in their lives. For many, many people, Robert Redford is one of those people. He's absolutely one of mine from the time that I can remember. I am a huge, huge &#8212; not only fan of his but he's been a personal hero for me. So yeah, it's going to be incredibly exciting to see him. An honor he clearly deserves, and I'm sure it's going to be fun to see.\n\nQM: That's so cool. Thank you so much, have fun tonight!\n\nJF: Alright, thank you.\n\n",

So tell me, why is it so important to be at this event?\n\nJorja: I think it's one of the most important events that you could attend in Los Angeles. Bringing attention to environmental awareness, which is at such a critical, frightening stage right now. I'm super excited to celebrate emRacing Extinction/em tonight, I've had the pleasure of seeing it already. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen.\n\nRenee: Really?\n\nJorja: Yeah.\n\nRenee: Why so?\n\nJorja: There's a context that the filmmakers are able to sort of just put everything in perspective, and share it in such a way that you feel it cerebrally. You feel it in your heart, you feel it through your body. You just want to get up and do something. It's also a hopeful film, believe it or not. You don't leave the theater going 'Oh well. Everything's lost.' Which is great.\n\nRenee: That's amazing. That you so much for being here. We're gonna let you get down the carpet, 'cause everyone wants to talk to you.\n\nJorja: Thank you.\n\nRenee: But we'll see you inside. Thank you.\n\nJorja: Thank you.",

But if I had to pick a favorite style it would probably be ... like ... Jazz. Maybe? \n\nLyla: Jorja! What's your favorite type of ice cream?\n\nJorja: Well, Lyla. I think my favorite kind of ice cream is called Kind Cream. And it's the cookies'n'cream flavor. Classic cookies'n'cream. And they used the cookies they get them from Baby Cakes Bakery in New York City. What about you?\n\nLyla: I like ... Hmmm ... So my three favorites would probably be- I just have three favorites because I can't choose.\n\nJorja: You can't choose!\n\nLyla: So I have cotton candy, chocolate, aaaaand ... So there's an ice cream store on Fire Island, it's called Unfriendly's Ice Cream, and one of their flavors is called Play-doh. It's vanilla ice cream dyed yellow, with little bits of cookie chunks in it.\n\nJorja: Wow!\n\nLyla: And they're dyed blue and orange and red to look like play-doh. This is Lylapalooza signing out!

        "content": "\nJorja Fox talks about her personal connection to the ocean and her perception of trophy hunting and the misrepresentation of sharks in the media.\n\nOur Connection to the Ocean\n\nI spend as much time on the water as I can. I've been bodyboarding since I was about six and surfing for about the last fifteen years. So I'm there, you know, several times a week if I can be.\n\nA long time ago, when you think of how mankind kind of evolved on earth, it was this battle  \nbetween man and nature. Man needed to dominate nature in order to survive. And we won that battle a long time ago. Now, you know, our job and and our kids' job is to figure out the balance on the planet. I guess at the end of the day, it's really important to know that that without the ocean, human survival will end. We need fish for our own survival and we need water and oxygen for out own survival. The ocean makes the bulk of the world's oxygen. If the oceans are sick, then the balance of the entire planet will fall apart.\n\nWe cannot survive without a healthy ocean.\n\nSharks and the Media\n\nThe shark programing, I think it's been very, very unfortunate you know in the last twenty or thirty years. On one hand, we know more about sharks than we ever did, and we've been exposed to sharks more than we could have ever imagined. But so much of that information has been negative information or kind of information that's more for to instill fear in people or to instill cheap kinda thrills, action packed thrills. \n\nThe media, whether it's been intentional or not, often focuses on stories that are gonna have a shock value for people, that are going to get people's attention. So, often, that's what sharks have have done inadvertently to people, or how people have been harmed by sharks. But I think what would be really important piece of this puzzle is if the media could start focusing on on how we are affecting short survival.\n\nTrophy Hunting\n\nSport fishing, in my opinion, and hunting for sport is kind of something that should go the way the history books. Something that people did. We don't do that anymore. Now we're actually trying to create sustainable habitat for wildlife and for sea life. \n\nThere was a time where lead paint was a great idea and where asbestos was a great idea. And both of them are sort of human ingenuity and we kind of  \nrealized \"Okay, well that was then and let's build things differently now and and and do things differently now because that's not sustainable for us anymore.\"\n\nWell me, personally, I'm not a fan of any kind of hunting and that would include commercial and sport fishing. It's just not something that I really understand and ... I think I would invite anybody who does enjoy that activity to take a few moments and ask themselves what about killing is so satisfying for them. I'm not really sure where the the sport or the fun is in that and I would encourage people just ask that question to themselves.  ",
