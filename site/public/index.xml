      <description>Sharks are more important to our lives than we may imagine. It is time for us to appreciate their significance. We are grateful for the amazing job they do, every day, in all the oceans around the world to keep fish stock and the ocean healthy and vibrant.
Thank you, sharks, for making us feel awe and wonder, for connecting us to the wild, for being a fierce predator but not seeing us as prey.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox of CSI fame celebrates her birthday today, so we take a look at how she spends her time off screen promoting plant based living.
She has been a vegetarian since she was 19, an aspiring vegan and has worked with PETA to help highlight the benefits of going veggie. She has also worked with ADI to inform people of the cruelty that goes on in circuses around the globe.</description>

She was essentially unknown at the time, but just a few months later she&amp;rsquo;d become much better-known to mainstream audiences when she joined the first-season cast of CSI.</description>

      <description>SELLER: Jorja Fox
LOCATION: Los Angeles, CA
PRICE: $1.85 million
SIZE: (approx.) 3,600 square feet, 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms
YOUR MAMA’S NOTES: A well-maintained, circa 1937 Mediterranean with loads of intact original architectural details in the hipster-chic Silver Lake area of Los Angeles — owned, according to our resources, by actress and producer Jorja Fox — has come available at $1.85 million. Miz Fox isn’t a tabloid superstar or even a gossip glossy regular, and we’d bet the farm she prefers it that way.</description>

AVC: So were you happy to come back in order for Gil and Sara to literally sail off into the sunset?
WP: Well, yeah, that was kind of… [Hesitates.] I mean, what are you going to do after all these years and everything, and you’re supposed to do a wrap-up in two hours? If they’d said, “Why don’t you do a wrap-up over several episodes?” we’d’ve done something different. But they sort of just sprang it on us after they canceled the show.</description>

Jorja: I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most important events that you could attend in Los Angeles. Bringing attention to environmental awareness, which is at such a critical, frightening stage right now.</description>

In Praise of CSI&amp;rsquo;s Happy Ending Question: Several years ago, I wrote to you regarding my extreme disappointment in CSI for divorcing Grissom and Sara, the series&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;long ship&amp;rdquo; known as GSR. Well, you were the voice of reason, saying that you hoped William Petersen would be back for the end. Thankfully, you were right. Although I still think they should not have been separated, the end of the finale was oh so satisfying.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox talks about her personal connection to the ocean and her perception of trophy hunting and the misrepresentation of sharks in the media.
Our Connection to the Ocean
I spend as much time on the water as I can. I&amp;rsquo;ve been bodyboarding since I was about six and surfing for about the last fifteen years. So I&amp;rsquo;m there, you know, several times a week if I can be.
A long time ago, when you think of how mankind kind of evolved on earth, it was this battle</description>

At some point in the episode, another woman blows herself up, this time, it&amp;rsquo;s a Lady Heather doppleganger outside of the mistresses&amp;rsquo; house. When the lookalike&amp;rsquo;s car explodes, Brass catches on fire, but once he&amp;rsquo;s extinguished by a fast-acting Sara, he stands there like a total bad-ass, proving once again that the former captain&amp;rsquo;s cajones are made of â¦ well, brass.
Gil&amp;rsquo;s in Vegas, sees his ex-wife Sara (#Awkward), and runs into a chipper redhead who flummoxes him to no end.</description>

Despite Lady Heather&amp;rsquo;s rivalry with Sara Sidle over the years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone wanted her to be a true terrorist, and CSI obliges. It&amp;rsquo;s a frame job, and when the real terrorist shows up&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s played by frequent baddie Doug Hutchinson&amp;ndash;we know immediately where the episode is going. Regardless, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, as this was an episode about bringing together the original team and sending them off in a way that pleased fans who showed up earlier in the show&amp;rsquo;s run as well as the fans who stuck around for the series over the long term.</description>

      <description>Full disclosure: I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in years, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean tonight wasn&amp;rsquo;t a total emotional roller coaster for me.
I watched every single episode for the first nine seasons at least, and even stuck around for a couple more after Grissom left (and broke my heart in the process).
[&amp;hellip;]
I loved CSI, and I never really stopped loving it. I just kind of grew up and apart from the show, just as the original characters grew apart from each other (looking at you, Grissom and Sara).</description>

      <description>Confession: I have never purposefully watched an episode of CSI. Or any of its spinoffs.
[&amp;hellip;]
 Sarah and Catherine, are they frenemies? I feel tension? I feel history? Tempted to Google, but that feels like cheating.  [&amp;hellip;]
 Wait, Sarah and Petersen were MARRIED?! Is that why there was tension with her and Marg&amp;rsquo;s character?! Love it.  [&amp;hellip;]

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja Fox, one of the show&amp;rsquo;s original cast members, has said in previous interviews that she didn&amp;rsquo;t think anyone would watch the series when it first premiered in 2000. She could not have been more wrong. The drama about a forensics investigation division in Las Vegas was an instant smash.
During its 15-year run, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; spawned three spinoffs and became one of TV&amp;rsquo;s most popular series, in the U.S. and internationally.</description>

      <description>In the end, &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; died as it lived: fun, flabby, and altogether too invested in the undying love of two deeply sexless characters.
[&amp;hellip;]
Though Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return for the series finale gave the show a badly needed jolt of original &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; magic, it also meant that the love story of Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle returned to center stage.
Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, was another of the show&amp;rsquo;s originating characters.</description>

      <description>While CSI has been one of the longest-running shows of the decade, its series finale drew almost no digital buzz. Amobee Brand Intelligence analyzed the engagements around the finale and found that just a few fans were called to action last night, which either means that CSI is more a of a VOD hit than anything else or that everyone was watching ABC, which premiered Quantico and Once Upon a Time last night.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Still, it was hard to complain about that, when the show not only brought back Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), but the long-since-gone Grissom (William Peterson) and- be still my heart- even Lady Heather, aka Dr. Kessler (Melinda Clarke). I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Grissom was as wonderfully grizzled and nerdy as ever, (Sara) sidling back into the role as if no time whatsoever had passed. As such, it was probably inevitable that he would get the most screen time, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s as it should be.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Grissom and Sara ended up together &amp;ndash; for good this time, we assume.&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
For a moment it seemed like the on-again, off-again lovers might go their separate ways, but come on. There&amp;rsquo;s no way that was happening. Instead, Sara left Vegas and flew to San Diego to join Gil on his boat. The pair literally sailed off into the sunset.&amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; was never the subtlest show.

      <description>After 15 years, 335 episodes and countless grisly death scenes, &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; said goodbye with a TV movie entitled &amp;lsquo;Immortality.&amp;rsquo; It was a chance to bid adieu to old friends, wrap up some loose ends, and watch a television institution ride off into the sunset.
But in true &amp;lsquo;Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; fashion, it was also an opportunity to bring some grisly drama. With Las Vegas itself under attack, would the return of Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass help save the day?</description>

DEADLINE: Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the final scene of Gil and Sara sailing off into the sunset. How did that ending come about?
ZUIKER: SixteenÂ years ago, William Petersen, (executive producers) Cindy Chvatal and Jonathan Littman and myself sat down at the Beverly Wilshire, that was the first time we got together.Â We actually met there 16 years later, same table, same party of four. And William Peterson pulled out this research folder that dealt with sea shepherd.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Still, it was interesting seeing this most coldly logical of mystery shows indulge its romantic side. At one point in the finale, a mysterious bad guy sends in a face-scrambling video message straight to Grissom: &amp;lsquo;The grand finale is specifically designed for you.&amp;rsquo; That vibed like a meta mission statement for &amp;lsquo;Immortality,&amp;rsquo; which worked best as an extremely melodramatic triangle between Grissom, longtime antagonist/ambiguous love interest Lady Heather, and even-longer-time ally/ex-wife Sara.</description>

We find Grissom working on a boat in San Diego, helping catch people illegally trapping sharks for shark fin soup. The CSIs that show up don&amp;rsquo;t mention Nick, who is their head last we heard.</description>

      <description>How will the &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; special two-hour series finale address the romance between William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Gil Grissom and Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle?
[&amp;hellip;]
Will there be closure for Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle?
You have to watch. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how they edited it so who knows?
They are teasing a lot about it in the trailer.
Of course, they are. I am always leery of saying much about it. With the technology and everything, everybody is going to find out anyway.</description>

      <description>Gil Grissom (William Petersen) returned to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; to talk to bees, lecture about whale songs and tell of a flower whose fragrance can make anyone lose control. For a final time, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s offbeat brilliance brightened the forensics work.
As the influential CBS crime procedural ended its 15-year run &amp;#8212; SPOILER ALERT &amp;#8212; Grissom also stopped a mad bomber and found personal happiness. Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return was a reminder that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; had never been the same since Grissom left.</description>

Beyond being entranced by the newly sophisticated level of high-tech forensic investigation and the clever murder scenarios the show employed, fans also fell for the character&amp;rsquo;s personal dramas &amp;ndash; most specifically Grissom&amp;rsquo;s slow-simmering romance with Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s fellow investigator Sara Sidle.
&amp;ldquo;All we wanted to do was sort of have a real relationship that exists sometimes in the workplace where there&amp;rsquo;s a little thing that happens,&amp;rdquo; says Petersen. &amp;ldquo;And that becomes a little bit more of a thing.</description>

Sara Sidle &amp;ndash; CSI Forensic scientist Sara Sidle makes a living being up-close and personal with dead bodies, but she draws the line when it comes to animals. Sarah wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a vegetarian, instead she became one halfway through the show after spending a night with a dead, decomposing pig. Remarkably, Sara wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first vegetarian character played by actress Jorja Fox, who also gave up meat for Dr Maggie Doyle on E.</description>

Without giving too much away what is the most important bit of closure that you&amp;rsquo;ll offer your die-hard fans?
This is the Super Bowl for (Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s) Sara Sidle. She&amp;rsquo;s applied for the directorship of running the lab. This is the one incident that brings back Grissom, and we see her being mentored by (Ted Danson&amp;rsquo;s) D.B. Russell. This is a case that paralyzes Vegas. One of the big burning questions of the finale is where (Grissom&amp;rsquo;s) heart will lie.</description>

Not surprisingly, there was a &amp;lsquo;the gang&amp;rsquo;s all here&amp;rsquo; quality to the finale (and SPOILER ALERT if you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched), which concocted an excuse to bring back Grissom (Petersen) to work a case alongside Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and ex-wife Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), all in the ostensible service of solving a crime that tied into his past, involving the dominatrix Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke). Frankly, anyone who has watched TV in the last 20-some-odd years should have instantly known whodunit when Doug Hutchison (who has been playing a psycho as far back as Tombs in &amp;lsquo;The X-Files&amp;rsquo;) showed up, but that really wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description>

After playing Las Vegas forensic scientist Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; for 15 seasons, Jorja Fox is preparing to face &amp;ndash; even welcoming &amp;ndash; uncertainty. &amp;ldquo;I think you kind of have to embrace the unknown if you&amp;rsquo;re an actor,&amp;rdquo; she says. The show that launched the colossal franchise on CBS &amp;ndash; as well as career aspirations for forensics obsessives everywhere &amp;ndash; concludes Sunday with a two-hour finale.</description>

Zuiker is staying pretty mum on the details of the finale, other than acknowledging that there is an explosion that &amp;ldquo;paralyzes Las Vegas&amp;rdquo; and hinting that the episode will deal with the resolution of Grissom&amp;rsquo;s relationships with both Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) and fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). In some ways, that feels ironic because of the show&amp;rsquo;s insistence early on, partially at Petersen&amp;rsquo;s behest, not to go home with its characters.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; wraps up its final case Sunday (Sept. 27), with a two-hour movie (CBS, 9 p.m.) that allows one of the most influential and successful shows in TV history to take a well-deserved final bow.
&amp;lsquo;If any show ever earned this kind of sendoff, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rsquo; CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler said this summer.
The last show, modestly titled &amp;lsquo;Immortality,&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t only let the CSI team save Las Vegas one final time.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; was a last-minute pickup by CBS, plugged into a Friday lineup whose widely forecast surefire hit would be a reboot of &amp;ldquo;The Fugitive,&amp;rdquo; not a quirky little drama dwelling on hair fibers and blood spatter.
&amp;ldquo;I thought it was never going to succeed,&amp;rdquo; says Jorja Fox. At the time she had a recurring role on &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; as a Secret Service agent, &amp;ldquo;but I thought, &amp;lsquo;How fun would it be just to take this ride for a little while!</description>

After 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes, the crime drama will bid farewell with a two-hour finale on Sept. 27. We asked some original cast members to reflect on their time behind the yellow tape.

The case only gets odder when they determine the man fell from a building blocks away, being thrown through glass thick enough to take a bullet. At first the lab suspects a missile, but they determine it&amp;rsquo;s a Squirrel Suit and manage to ID the deceased: Captain Robert Holland, Air Force.</description>

Disclaimer: Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s is not a typical success story. The CSI: Crime Scene Investigation staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt.</description>

      <description>It is hard to believe the &amp;ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; writers specifically meant for an episode surrounding panic around an Ebola-like virus to land on the schedule exactly when Ebola panic has permeated the US consciousness at yet to be matched levels of cable news attention. Even so, with multiple references to Ebola in the first fifteen minutes alone, the comparisons are too timely and specific to be a complete coincidence.</description>

Season 15 has the CSI night-shift chief, played by Ted Danson, dealing with a crisis of conscience, and a threat to his career, when Las Vegas is rattled by a series of murders strikingly similar to those committed by the Gig Harbor Killer &amp;#8212; aka Jared Briscoe (Mark-Paul Gossalaar) &amp;#8212; a sicko Russell put behind bars years ago.</description>

      <description>Twenty years ago this week, a little hospital show called &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; debuted on NBC to much fanfare and managed to exceed the hype. For years, it was television&amp;rsquo;s #1 drama; it reinvented the television form, bringing a previously-unseen cinematic approach to shooting action in its Chicago hospital setting. And it had one of the deepest, craziest, most lovable ensembles in the history of television, both helped and eventually done in by its excessive longevity.</description>

      <description>Synopsis The CSIs investigate a present-day crime with ties to a mob heist that occurred 25 years ago, out in Ellis Springs. Back in 1989, a trio of local kids got tangled in a heist, where the loot was never recovered and one of them (Scotty Gates) was presumably killed as he was never seen again. Of the survivors, Roger Mathers had moved to Texas, but when his solar-panel company started failing, high-tailed it back to Nevada, and ended up dead near the shack where the kids ran into the mob all that time ago.</description>

      <description>HOW DO YOU DEFINE BALANCED LIVING?
 JORJA FOX
VIVA COVER GIRL AND STAR OF CSI
Balance comes from the inside anbd I think it looks different for different people. What is balance for you and for me might be two different things. At the end of the day, if you are doing something you love, and if you can sleep at night, then that sets up a good equilibrium. An accomplishment and a restful night&amp;rsquo;s sleep help to keep me stable.</description>

&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;How does it feel to be on a show that&amp;rsquo;s clocked up over 300 episodes?&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing and it hit me today because I saw Jorja (co-star Jorja Fox) in the trailer getting ready and for her, she has been here for (over) 300 episodes. So to see the impact on her made me realise how powerful it was. You know, I&amp;rsquo;ve only done 33 episodes, so I have such a great deal of respect for all the people that have made this show so amazing to make it last this long.</description>

Jane Velez-Mitchell: CSI star Jorja Fox plays a determined crime scene investigator, who won&amp;rsquo;t let anything stand in her pursuit of the truth. When she&amp;rsquo;s off the set, she&amp;rsquo;s just as determined to free animals from captivity. I talked to Jorja about why she thinks Blackfish is a giant step for all animals in captivity.
[Clip of CSI]
Jane Velez-Mitchell: Jorja Fox, you play Sara Sidle on CSI and you do such a great job of investigating.</description>

      <description>Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s episode of CSI marks the CBS procedural&amp;rsquo;s 300th episode, and no matter how you slice it, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of murder.
[&amp;hellip;]
Realizing the show would reach the milestone this season, executive producer Don McGill says they wanted this entire season in general, and the 300th episode in particular, to look back at the show&amp;rsquo;s history. &amp;ldquo;When Carol and I talked about the season, [we thought,] &amp;#8216;Back to the beginning,&amp;lsquo;&amp;rdquo; McGill says.</description>

      <description>Over 14 seasons and 300 episodes, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has concocted some wild plots and brought in memorable guest stars to keep the body-bagging business fresh and fun. We asked the cast - including Marg Helgenberger, who reprises her role as Catherine Willows for Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s landmark 300th episode, which flashes back to a case the team failed to crack in 2000 - to reflect on the show&amp;rsquo;s best installments, selected by longtime executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</description>

      <description>The 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.
A cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.
The evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series.</description>

      <description>Introduction Announcer: Please, before we start anything, give a big hand to Pacific Sun, who is responsible for letting Lion Ark be here today. The film is co-presented by Animal Defenders International, which had, obviously you&amp;rsquo;ll see, an integral part in the creation of Lion Ark. We&amp;rsquo;re very happy to have this film, it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful film, it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting film. It&amp;rsquo;s going to subvert a lot of your expectations about both seeing a documentary and about some of the assumptions we had growing up or seeing in our culture.</description>

&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Is there any chance of Grissom popping up in CSI&amp;#8216;s 300th episode? &amp;ldquo;Selena&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;ADAM:&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo; In the flesh? Nah. But the episode, which flashes back to a 14-year-old case, does feature a full-circle shout-out to the man who started it all. &amp;ldquo;[The writers] pay a very sound and beautiful homage to [Grissom],&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox says. Speaking of Grissom, how is Sara handling the couple&amp;rsquo;s separation this season? &amp;ldquo;Sara is too young to sleep alone,&amp;rdquo; Fox says.</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox answer burning questions about Sara&amp;rsquo;s return and the crime show&amp;rsquo;s killer new season&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;
The most baffling crime on CSI last season wasn&amp;rsquo;t a stabbing or shooting. It was a missing persons case: The show&amp;rsquo;s lead investigator for its first nine seasons, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), left the series halfway through the year, sending CSI&amp;#8216;s ratings slipping and causing concern for its cast and producers.
&amp;ldquo;We look at last season in a way not dissimilar from the fans,&amp;rdquo; admits executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</description>

The entire lab takes the case personally, with even David Hodges complaining that Morgan was undercover (not a role for a CSI).</description>

      <description>Monica Gleberman .. and just ask you, how did you get involved in acting to begin with?
Jorja Fox Oh my goodness. I wanted to act since I was probably four or five years old. I think that the television that sat in the living room of my house was one of the bigger influences in my life. It was definitely a babysitter for me. You know, I grew up in a small town, so there weren&amp;rsquo;t many acting programs.</description>

Looking at your filmography, you’ve been on a ton of great shows with some amazing actors, Reaper, House, Buffy. Was there an actor you worked with that really surprised you?
I’ve been so lucky that I just walked on set after set with just such welcoming actors, and that’s great because you hear horror stories. But I remember having to do a very emotional scene on CSI, and at the time, CSI was the #1 show, 30 million viewers each week, absurd numbers, you would think that if there was one set there would be big egos, it would be that set.</description>

Question: I know you will probably give me your stock answer about &amp;ldquo;ships&amp;rdquo; and the realities of TV business, but don&amp;rsquo;t you think the break-up of Sara and Grissom on *CSI* was unusually cruel to the long suffering fans of this couple? I know William Petersen won&amp;rsquo;t be back on the show, but would it have been so bad to keep him off-screen like he has been, and let the writers keep their marriage safe and in the background?</description>

      <description>Synopsis Peter Coe, a professional poker player, lost big in the Palermo Poker Classic (PPC) before dying from having his neck cut open in the elevator of his hotel. The only problem? He was in the elevator alone. His friend (and virtual neice) Eva Rendell, the only woman left in the PPC, was at the hotel with Coe, but left before he got on the elevator. David Hodges solves the locked room mystery by determining the killer threw a playing card (the Ace of Spades) to slice Coe&amp;rsquo;s throat as the doors closed.</description>

      <description>CSI returns to UK TV tonight, with the American goliath that&amp;rsquo;s spawned not only the rise of the pathology TV show, but also thousands of careers in forensics back to defend its crown on Channel 5.
As she begins to start her latest tour of duty as the devoted Sara Silde on the show, we chatted to star Jorja Fox about being on the show for more than a decade, the world of forensics and her dreams of being a rock and roll star.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m crushed that the *CSI *writers broke up Sara and Grissom! What are they thinking?
Lisa
ADAM: Hopefully, this news will console you. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s over,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Don McGill tells us. &amp;ldquo;We felt the relationship had hit the true rocks and things were really at a breaking point. But they&amp;rsquo;re not divorced or even separated. They&amp;rsquo;re really just taking a very big time out.&amp;rdquo; More good news: The writers aren&amp;rsquo;t planning to throw Sara into any rebound flings and are actually hoping that this relationship hiccup might lure Grissom himself, William Petersen, back to the show.</description>

      <description>There has always been a great divide amongst the fans of CSI, between those who love Grissom and Sara together and those who, I don’t know, hate romance and kick puppies for fun. Up until last night, the fans of GSR had pretty much won most of the battles in this cold war, but with “Forget Me Not,” this week’s episode, the other side landed a major, heart-breaking victory when Sara revealed that she and Grissom have separated.</description>

      <description>The February 20 episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; sees Sara (Jorja Fox) in hot water after a brief encounter with a man leaves her as the prime suspect in his murder case. Even worse &amp;#8212; her interaction with the victim has the team suspecting she&amp;rsquo;s cheating on Grissom (William Petersen).
In The Huffington Post&amp;rsquo;s exclusive clip from Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s Sara/Grissom-centric episode, Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) points out that as far as the rest of the team is concerned, if Sara cheated on her much-beloved husband, she &amp;ldquo;may as well have cheated on God.</description>

How long have you been working on this show
About 7 years ago, I started to listen heavily to her music, watching videos and reading anything I could get my hands on. I wrote monologues in her voice and sang her songs at an open mic night at The Gardenia Club in West Hollywood. I won a screenwriting grant at University of Southern California and used that to get some musical charts in order and prototype a show.</description>

      <description>Santa visited &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans early this year, as we received the unexpected gift of a Sara-centered episode on &amp;ldquo;Risky Business Class.&amp;rdquo; It was based on a former colleague of Sara&amp;rsquo;s, Doug Wilson from the NTSB, asking for the help from the crime lab.
First, I&amp;rdquo;m thrilled that we got an episode that focused on this team member, specifically her marriage to Grissom. Many fans have wondered why there isn&amp;rsquo;t more mention of Grissom or why Sara doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to acknowledge that she&amp;rdquo;s even hitched.</description>

      <description>Now that all of my fellow GSR fans have breathed a collective sigh of relief, although it might be a bit premature, I can honestly say that &amp;lsquo;Risky Business Class,&amp;rsquo; this week&amp;rdquo;s episode of CSI, will only ever be memorable as the episode that clearly exposed the rift in Grissom and Sara&amp;rdquo;s marriage.
There have been signs that the long distance arrangement is wearing on her all season, but it usually takes something big to make us wake up and realize there&amp;rdquo;s a problem in our lives, and for Sara it took the appearance of Doug Wilson, an NSTB investigator and former fling from San Francisco, who arrived in Vegas to investigate the crash of a small charter plane just off the Strip.</description>

NTSB Investigator Doug Wilson is brought in to help work the case. The plane took off from Las Vegas airport, headed to Chicago, but cited an unspecified emergency. Then there was radio silence, and the plane just missed running into a tower at the Mediterranean Hotel before crashing.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line to ride when doing interviews with folks from the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation franchise. Obviously, I am a huge fan of the shows (otherwise I would not be here), so there’s always a bit of excitement and nostalgia when doing promotional material. But there’s always a reminder in the back of my head that CSI Files is a very professional outlet, and I have to be somewhat on guard as to how ‘geeky’ I get.</description>

In general,Â *CSI*Â has become a richer series. It&amp;rdquo;s minimized the crazy-Vegas murder scenarios that were beginning to undermine minimal believability, and I&amp;rdquo;d say that even if you wish that, say, Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;s Sara had more of a role in the show these days, that reflects the way things happen in any given workplace â some veterans tend to recede into the background, content to do their jobs well, while new faces (Shue&amp;rdquo;s Finn, in this case) come on like gangbusters, eager (or neurotic, or insecure, or all of the above) to prove themselves.</description>

The PSA is only 90 seconds long but the impact of the video is strong. The scenes flip from free roaming wild elephants in Africa to a traveling circus elephant named Krissy that is chained, beaten, and broken for the entertainment of humans.
Fox appears in the PSA holding a bullhook with a very solemn expression on her face.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a joke almost as old as show business itself. The aging actor - or, the more common stereotype, actress - who insists they can play characters decades younger than they are.
In our modern information age, though, it&amp;rsquo;s no laughing matter.
In October, an actress filed suit against Amazon and its subsidiary, the Internet Movie Database, for posting her birth date on the latter website.
The world&amp;rsquo;s most comprehensive repository of information about films, television shows and just about everybody who&amp;rsquo;s ever worked on them, IMDb has become the standard reference for not only journalists and fans, but increasingly for folks in the industry who want to check out potential hires.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox spends her days investigating crimes on the TV show &amp;lsquo;CSI.&amp;rsquo; Now, she&amp;rsquo;s asking the public to do some investigating of their own. Not hair remnants or clothing fibers, but the way 10 billion farm animals are raised for food annually in the USA. She wants you to explore vegetarianism.
The actress debuted her new PETA ad at the vegan restaurant Sublime, and even helped with the cooking. They prepared spicy Singapore street noodles, &amp;ldquo;chicken picatta, and gourmet pizzas.</description>

      <description>Washington, DC &amp;#8212; Ever wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening with Sara and Gil and their long-distance, practically nonexistent relationship on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? So does Jorja Fox. If she could write her own episode, she&amp;rsquo;d want to &amp;ldquo;look at her love affair more closely.&amp;rdquo; She says &amp;ldquo;it would be amazing if she traveled somewhere kind of exotic to see Grissom and see what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.&amp;rdquo; She says Sara may be happily married, but &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s really lonely.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox thinks that everyone should play detective and investigate how animals are killed for food. Jorja unveiled her pro-vegetarian PETA ad to an enthusiastic crowd Sunday at Fort Lauderdale&amp;rsquo;s gourmet vegan restaurant, Sublime.
She even got things cooking in the kitchen, helping the chefs with the evening&amp;rsquo;s delicious cruelty-free feast.
Jorja went vegetarian years agoâhalfway through a sandwich. &amp;ldquo;I was having a meatball sub one day in Brooklyn, and it just clicked,&amp;rdquo; she explains.</description>

      <description>Animal activists and celebrities launched a new effort Wednesday to protect exotic animals by taking the &amp;ldquo;traveling&amp;rdquo; out of traveling circuses.
The proposed federal legislation would place sharp limits on the ability to transport lions, tigers and elephants around the country. Circuses say it would essentially shut down the animal portion of their shows.
Representatives from L.A.-based Animal Defenders International and Northern California&amp;rsquo;s Performing Animal Welfare Society, along with critter-friendly celebrities Bob Barker and Jorja Fox, held a press conference in Washington, D.</description>

      <description>I do think that a question that some of you may be asking right now is &amp;ldquo;Well what about my kids? Can&amp;rsquo;t my kids have the same chance I did to go to these traveling circuses?&amp;rdquo; Or maybe these circuses your parents went to. And I thought about this at length, and I think the truth is that our kids look to us for what is right, and our kids look to us for what is fun.</description>

      <description>Bob Barker, the former host of &amp;ldquo;The Price Is Right,&amp;rdquo; made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses.
At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty.
&amp;ldquo;How do they train them?</description>

      <description>Bob Barker, a well known animal enthusiast, and Jorja Fox, an animal advocate as well, had teamed up to help get three elephants moved to a sanctuary from a Toronto zoo where things were too cold.
And now they are in Washington, launching a bill called the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act.
The bill would:
&amp;ldquo;[â¦]restrict the use of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses,&amp;rdquo; [and end the] &amp;lsquo;random cruelty and neglect&amp;rsquo; found in these circuses.</description>

Jorja Fox: It feels amazing and embarrassing at the same time. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled that I get on the list, and I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how that happens. It may have to do with the little bit of green that I slip them to put me on it.
Glittarazi: Oh! Okay! I guess my other question is how would you like to expand or take this cause one step further?</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but I think I am starting to actually &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; D.B. Russell. Granted, the show&amp;rsquo;s new lead (played by Ted Danson) had a very good supporting story this episode, continuing the trend of the crimes getting more interesting, which is something the show hasn&amp;rsquo;t done for some time.
Two different scenes took the forefront this week. Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) and Greg (Eric Szmanda) followed a man found dead on the streets, his lungs full of chocolate.</description>

The youngest child in the house, a small girl, Fiona, was cleaned up in fresh clothes after she was killed.</description>

Is it possible that, in his zeal to help save the show from cancellation, Ted Danson is rubbing some castmates the wrong way? Sure. A lot of the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cast has been on the show from the beginning and probably have their own ways of working together.</description>

      <description>The merry-go-round that is Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s status on the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has changed once again &amp;#8212; but this time the news is good.
Fox, who has been a guest star for the last four years, is returning to the show this fall as a series regular (as reported by TV Line). The actress was briefly fired from her role as CSI investigator Sara Sidle back in 2004 for failing to report to work (along with her co-star George Eads) during a contract dispute.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox is returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; as a series regular in the fall.
The actress was a series regular for the first seven seasons, playing tenacious forensic scientist Sara Sidle. Fox left at the beginning of Season 8 and returned only as a guest star the following seasons. But now she&amp;rsquo;s coming back to Clark County for good, TV Line reported.
Fox will be starring alongside Ted Danson, who recently replaced outgoing Laurence Fishburne as head of the investigation team for the procedural during the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s 12th-season shakeup.</description>

      <description>When she was abducted and buried alive, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s head spun. If he needed to kill someone to find her, he would have. When she left for good Grissom felt like his whole world fell apart &amp;ndash; no he felt like dying was a better punishment for his inability to set aside his career for his relationship with her.

      <description>It appears that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s on-again, off-again relationship with the long-running CBS hit &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is on again. And this time it&amp;rsquo;s permanent &amp;hellip; for now.
The actress who plays crime scene investigator Sara Sidle has signed on as a series regular after four seasons as a guest star, according to a report from TV Line.
Fox has disappeared and re-appeared from the show seemingly as many times as the Miniature Killer that almost took the life of Fox&amp;rsquo;s character.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox returned to CSI, and considering her long history with the CBS crime procedural and the huge popularity of character Sara Sidle, you&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking the actress was already a series regular. Not so, TV Line revealed this week, as Fox has only just been promoted to regular status, coinciding with the start of CSI&amp;rsquo;s twelfth season this fall.
Fox, 43, used to be a series regular during the first seven seasons of CSI; however, she left the show at the start of Season 8.</description>

How it was the experience working in a chapter of a prime time TV show CSI with Academy Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin or TV stars like Jorja Fox?
It was truly wonderful. Marlee is a genius, I was so jealous watching her work. Because it was a deaf themed episode (The Two Mrs. Grissoms) we had tons of deaf actors, including Phyllis Frelich, who won the Tony for the same role, Marlee won the Oscar (Sarah in &amp;ldquo;Children of a Lesser God&amp;rdquo;, Phyllis on Broadway and Marlee in the film).</description>

The CSIs trace the evidence to Dr. Elliot Davis Aden, a discredited psychoanalyst who worked for the government during the Red Scare, until he fell into the lure of drugs.</description>

      <description>(CNN) &amp;#8212; Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains.
Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its &amp;ldquo;Operation Lion Ark.&amp;rdquo;
The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses.</description>

TIM PHILLIPS, ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL: These lions have lived their life in a tiny, rusting, disgusting cage on the back of a lorry. Tomorrow they&amp;rsquo;re going to feel the wind blow in their face. They&amp;rsquo;re going to feel grass beneath their feet. They&amp;rsquo;re going to roam into the bushes. They&amp;rsquo;re going to do whatever they want. They&amp;rsquo;re going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.</description>

      <description>These times are tough for CSI. Yeah, the show still does well in the ratings, but the series has lost its mojo since William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Gil Grissom left two years ago. [&amp;hellip;]

The return of Jorja for as Sara Sidle hasn&amp;rsquo;t really upped the energy level. (If anything, the shoe has suffered a bit by loosing another woman &amp;#8212; Liz Vassey as the sparky &amp;ldquo;lab rat&amp;rdquo; Wendy Simms.)
Now in its 11th season, CSI still airs good hours, and coexecutive producers Treena Hancock and Melissa R.</description>

      <description>DENVER &amp;#8212; More than two dozen Bolivian circus lions were getting accustomed to their new surroundings at The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colo., Thursday.
They arrived at their new permanent home on 80 acres of open space Wednesday evening, after a long flight from Bolivia to Denver.
The lions were greeted by a couple of well-known celebrity animal activists, Bob Barker from &amp;ldquo;The Price is Right,&amp;rdquo; and actress Jorja Fox from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</description>

The 13 males and 12 females were scheduled to land at Denver International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.
Animal Defenders International say the lions were rescued from deplorable conditions after a law was passed last year in Bolivia prohibiting performances that involve animals.
Television personality Bob Barker financed the rescue.</description>

      <description>**Pets In The City: **For many of us, the circus brings back fond memories of lions, tigers, and other large, beautiful creatures performing incredible acts of courage and agility usually with their tamers and trainers on board. But in recent years, the ability of some circuses to properly care for these large beasts has been under scrutiny. This scrutiny has not been limited to the United States. Joining us today is Jorja Fox, who plays the popular character Sara Sidle on the mega hit *CSI *Las Vegas, to talk about her personal work on behalf of some very special and now globe-trotting lions that she and other notable stars have helped move from Bolivia to the U.</description>

Story:
While attending a scholarship benefit party for the hearing impaired with Gil&amp;rsquo;s mother Betty (Phyllis Frelich), Sara (Jorja Fox) is first on the scene when a car bomb goes off. The man inside is Dr. Eric Lambert (Anthony Natale), a colleague of Prof. Julia Holden (Marlee Matlin), who we later learn is Gil&amp;rsquo;s ex.
After learning that Julia, who was at the scene when the car was discovered, lied about her whereabouts at the time of the explosion, Sara puts her in the crosshairs as the prime suspect.</description>

It was not, however, a particularly splashy comeback. Grissom appeared only at the end of the episode (the scene is above) to chat with his wife, Sara (Jorja Fox) and mom (guest star Phyllis Frelich), via video conference.</description>

Sources tell Entertainment Weekly that the actor - who departed the drama a year ago &amp;ndash; has already shot his upcoming scene, which will involve Grissom&amp;rsquo;s on-screen wife, Sara.
Considering the storyline of &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms,&amp;rdquo; which will feature Gil&amp;rsquo;s mother and ex-girlfriend, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the appearances goes down this week.</description>

The following promotional clip from the Feb. 3 episode â which finds Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara working through some issues with her disapproving mother-in-law â strongly suggests that William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s MIA Grissom will figure into the family squabble.
But will William Petersen actually be making an appearance â as CSI Files is reporting? Or will Grissom remain an off screen presence?</description>

      <description>As hard-core fans of CBS&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; know, former CSI boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen) had deaf parents and therefore is adept at American Sign Language. They also know he married fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and is in the jungle doing research, while Sara is back in Las Vegas working crime scenes.
But what they probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that Grissom had another woman in his past, something that Sara discovers in a rather uncomfortable way.</description>

Ainav in Israel: I found a piece of information on the web that episode 11.13 of CSI is called &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms&amp;rdquo;! Now I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much for CSI anymore, but if that&amp;rsquo;s true then I care a whole lot!
It&amp;rsquo;s true! The Mrs. Grissoms in question are Sarah Sidle (the current Mrs. Grissom)&amp;hellip;and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s mom! Producers are casting now for the older Mrs. Grissom, who is described as a &amp;ldquo;strong, confident, intelligent and influential woman has never allowed her lack of hearing to keep her from doing anything she wanted, and has no trouble making her feelings known to one and all.</description>

      <description>Following an early season&amp;rsquo;s worth recent rocky episodes, &amp;ldquo;House of Hoarders&amp;rdquo; was a pleasant surprise.
After weeks of sharks in pools, vampires taking on werewolves, and a gimpy serial killers wearing pleather suits, I was almost certain the show&amp;rsquo;s handling of this psychological ailment of the moment would be serve as nothing but shock value.
But the writers took time to address the issue as a mystery and a very real problem.</description>

- &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; premiere thoughts: Man, where to freaking begin?Â Okay, first the good stuff. Larry Fishburne enters his third season on the show with some goddamn attitude, something his Dr. Raymond Langston character has been missing since he started in 2008, and it&amp;rsquo;s been great. Langston, still hurt from the prison attack that ended last season, walks around with a cane and a sneer, like he&amp;rsquo;s telling the world &amp;ldquo;I am through with you all fucking with me!</description>

As the aircraft touched down, the level of excitement hit fever pitch: after months of negotiations, the four lions had finally made it: Camba, Simba, Bambek and Dactari were going to a new home.</description>

      <description>Some TV couples just have a certain spark. It makes them intriguing to watch as an audience, and their will-they-or-won&amp;rsquo;t-they plotlines and ups and downs create fan bases. Here is a list of the top ten TV couples.
[&amp;hellip;]
 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) &amp;ndash; CSI  This was handled in a different way. There were always hints that Sara and Grissom had a relationship prior to their time at CSI, and then it was suddenly revealed that they had been dating &amp;ndash; for years &amp;ndash; during the time period of the show.</description>

CSI show runner Carol Mendelsohn tells me Bill Irwin will be reprising his role as inmate Nathan Haskell in the show&amp;rsquo;s 11th season premiere, then return for three additional episodes in a story arc that will finally introduce the wife of Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s Dr. Raymond Langston. &amp;ldquo;Toward the end of the season, Mrs. Langston will play a pivotal role,&amp;rdquo; says Mendelsohn. Plus, hearing that Marg Helgenberger has decided to end her long run as Catherine Willows this season, Mendelsohn says she plans to &amp;ldquo;start begging on my knees as the season progresses.</description>

Having Roger Daltrey on the team was awesome. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any scenes with him but I went with Jorja Fox to present myself at his trailer.</description>

**Question: **Just read that Jorja Fox is returning as Sara Sidle on CSI, though it is not known yet whether she&amp;rsquo;d come back as a recurring star, as she has been since her initial &amp;ldquo;return,&amp;rdquo; or as a regular cast member. Though I was happy to read the news &amp;mdash; I think the show is better when Fox is on it &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;d be happy if she does a recurring role because then she&amp;rsquo;d still be Sara Sidle Grissom, but if it&amp;rsquo;s as a regular, I would think her tie with Gil would have to be eliminated, and I&amp;rsquo;ve rather liked the mentions because I still think the show lost a lot when Grissom (William Petersen) left.</description>

      <description>**Q. **I guess I missed an episode, because I have no idea why Sara (played by Jorja Fox) is back on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo; The last I saw, she quit and went to live in the jungle, followed shortly by Grissom. Later, she made a statement about her husband being in Paris. Could you please clear up this puzzle?
- Sandra Robson,
Port St. Lucie, Fla.
A. The CBS show wrote Sara out during season eight, and she bowed out by leaving Grissom (William Petersen) a letter explaining that she had to go away to deal with personal demons.</description>

      <description>Washington&amp;rsquo;s resident water lover, Philippe Cousteau (yes, he&amp;rsquo;s the grandson of that famous Cousteau) was exported to Hollywood on Thursday to teach actress Alyssa Milano and musician Jason Mraz a thing or two about the Gulf oil spill.
The District-based group, the Artists and Athletes Alliance, shipped Cousteau to Los Angeles so he could talk about the environmental effects at a private Hollywood briefing.
&amp;ldquo;Philippe offered his unique insight into the disaster and suggested ways for members of the entertainment community to assist with the recovery efforts,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Ross, executive director of the Artists and Athletes Alliance.</description>

At another Hollywood party, I recognised Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle in CSI. Buoyed by my earlier success with Liv Tyler, and fortified by several beers, I loitered with intent, waiting for the right time to introduce myself.
It is possible that I appeared to be a wild-eyed, leering madman. Apparently sensing that I was standing a little too close to be innocently passing by, Jorja stood up and, well &amp;hellip; ran away from me.</description>

      <description>This just in: Jorja Fox (Sara) has renewed her commitment to CSI.
Sources confirm to me exclusively that Fox has signed on to return for the procedural’s upcoming 11th season. Terms of her new contract are being kept under wraps, so it’s unclear whether she’ll be billed as a recurring guest star or a series regular.
CBS declined to comment.
Fox was one of five CSI vets negotiating new pacts with the show &amp;ndash; and the last to sign on the dotted line.</description>

Carol Mendelsohn tells me. &amp;ldquo;But [she&amp;rsquo;s] definitely in the finale, and since the finale is a &amp;lsquo;to be continued,&amp;rsquo; I would say it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good bet that Jorja will be back for at least some or all of next season.</description>

YOU know how entwined the character you play on screen is to your real life when die-hard fans raised enough money to fly banner-bearing planes over a television network demanding to keep your character from leaving.
Or when your name is Jorja Fox and a silly reporter (that would be me) greets you over the phone with an unthinking &amp;ldquo;Hi, Sara!</description>

      <description>Welcome home, Jorja Fox. Even as we longed for her return as Sara Sidle (a.k.a. Mrs Gil Grissom) on CSI, Fox said she had been missing her onscreen persona, her cast-mates and the show terribly.
So much that she had to restrain herself from tuning in.
&amp;hellip;I stopped watching* CSI* because I figured the sadness would go away if I don&amp;rsquo;t watch it,&amp;rdquo; the 48-year-old actress said in a recorded interview.</description>

      <description>WHEN she announced that she was taking a break from acting three years ago, CSI fans flew planes over the Universal Studios film sets in California in protest.
But the banners they used, which read &amp;#8216;Keep Jorja Fox on CBS&amp;rsquo;, can now be kept away.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Jorja Fox, 42, will reprise her role as tough cookie forensic scientist Sarah Sidle on hit crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;s 10th season.</description>

Question: I&amp;rsquo;ve been a *CSI *(Las Vegas) fan from the beginning. But this season has just lost me. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Sara is back while Grissom is off in Paris? I thought their love story ended beautifully in the jungle. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;happy Sara&amp;rdquo; either. It just seems too OOC (out of character) for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about the Dr. Jekyll storyline the way I did with the miniature killer, blue-paint killer or the Paul Millander story.</description>

The evidence backs up the witnesses, and the rookie officer didn&amp;rsquo;t see what happened. A second case at a school appears to be a gang execution of a snitch, but the cases intersect when the two victims turn out to have been talking regularly.</description>

      <description>I think we all saw this coming, right? The return of Sara Sidle (uhh, Grissom) cannot be just for five episodes this season. Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the current season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; will be indefinite, which means we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of her than we initially thought this season.
&amp;ldquo;This season is about bringing the family back together again,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told Entertainment Weekly&amp;#8216;s Michael Ausiello.</description>

**Question: I’m thrilled Jorja Fox is sticking with CSI, but what about William Petersen? I want to see Grissom and Sara together. &amp;ndash;Alex
Ausiello: They were just together, albeit off screen. As exec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells me, Sara will reveal in this week’s episode that she “just got back from visiting Grissom in Paris.” Mendelsohn adds that, “We have no plans for Billy to return at the moment, but the door’s always open.</description>

      <description>This long-distance marriage thing seems to be working for Grissom and Sara on CSI. Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms to me exclusively that Jorja Fox’s five-episode comeback has been extended indefinitely.
“We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja,” says Mendelsohn. “The season is about bringing the [CSI] family back together again, so [this] was just a natural. Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.</description>

Jorja Fox, who we will soon see back on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; guest stars as housewife in jail in desperate need of legal services on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; (Sunday, Lifetime, 9 p.m.). Do you remember a few years ago, when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; acted like they didn&amp;rsquo;t need Jorja Fox or George Eads and that basically the cast was replaceable a la &amp;ldquo;Law &amp;amp; Order?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that this hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out to be the case.</description>

      <description>Synopsis Ryan Lester is a porn producer, killed in the tub similarly to the Paul Millander killings in a relatively upscale Vegas area. The economic downturn has led to more renters and people of shadier incomes. The investigation leads them to a peeping tom by the name of Craig Mason, adopted son of Judge Mason (aka Paul Millander), now a teenaged goth with a penchant to heavy metal music. They find a second body, his throat slit similarly to Lester, but on the ground outside his house, which he&amp;rsquo;s using as a drug house.</description>

Question: I went to bed Thursday night thinking, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to ask Matt what he thinks of [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/ CSI],&amp;rsquo; and then Friday I saw there was a CSI [http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/csi/sara-is-back-2548.html recap] by Neil Turitz and found it SO RIGHT ON that I commented right away. I&amp;rsquo;d always loved the show and had high hopes for it after Gil left, thinking Laurence Fishburne would bring something different to the mix and the rest of the wonderful cast was still there (Sara had left already) so I gave it my all but it didn&amp;rsquo;t give back.</description>

All times listed are Eastern Standard Time for September 28- October 4
[&amp;hellip;]
You know how sometimes I have to remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m only watching a TV show and the characters aren&amp;rsquo;t real? That&amp;rsquo;s EXACTLY how I felt when we found out Sara and Grissom are married on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.). I was so happy that those two crazy kids had finally found a way to make it work.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Trifecta: &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;CSI: NY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;
The mothership clearly had the strongest opening, with that stellar freeze-frame shot that traveled all through the lab, water droplets floating in the air, bullets rippling by. It was visually arresting, almost like a comic book come to life. So some actress died. The sad thing about being a procedural fan is that there are so many things you&amp;rsquo;re hip to, that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;ndash;like the fact that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cast Cromatie (Garret Dillahunt) from Sarah Conner unless he was doing some dirty.</description>

      <description>Sara returns to a team in transition.
[&amp;hellip;]
Sorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they&amp;rsquo;ve opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She&amp;rsquo;s badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris.</description>

      <description>I found out Jorja Fox was a KCRW fan when I spotted her at an event we put on earlier this year called RadioActive. She looked like all the other music lovers, ready to get her groove on! The actress is perhaps best known for her work in the hit CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as well as roles on ER and The West Wing, but her love of music is clearly a major part of her life.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like one of those long, cool, signature &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; tracking shots, but the one that opened the new season last night was a little longer and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, a lot cooler than the norm. We would even go so far as to call the shot &amp;ndash; which showed the entire team in freeze frame even though they were clearly in the middle of some kind of gun battle &amp;ndash; downright nifty.</description>

Most Special Effect: The elaborate opening shot of CSI&amp;#8216;s opening episode was as dazzling as promised: a freeze-frame tableau of the lab&amp;rsquo;s violent invasion by gun-toting Russian mobsters. Shards of broken glass, blood spatter, bullet trajectories, gunshot flares, and bodies in various modes of action-hero motion, all frozen in a 3D-like tapestry of chaos. The episode that followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, either, and Jorja Fox is welcome back anytime, although we&amp;rsquo;re sorry we missed Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s wedding.</description>

      <description>The way I see it, it&amp;rsquo;s as if Sara Sidle never really left.
I mean, she left in the eighth, showed up on the ninth, and is sort of returning to the team for the tenth, which starts tonight, right? Then again, there are a lot of questions now that Sara&amp;rsquo;s back on CSI. You know, stuff about her reasons for her return, or what she&amp;rsquo;s been up to in between her first departure, her Costa Rican gig, and her return.</description>

JH: Original cast member Jorja Fox is coming back for a handful of episodes. Is she coming back in the same role with the CSI group or&amp;hellip;?
NS: In a sense, she is stepping into her old role but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a different Sara. The Sara who left was burnt out, was pretty messed up by the job and what happened to her but when she first came back there was a big question mark in her life which was the nature of her relationship with Grissom but that actually got resolved in a very happy way.</description>

      <description>One of the many conflicts about Thursday night TV is this:
I don&amp;rsquo;t watch CSI regularly (weak stomach), but the thought of Jorja Fox and Marg Helgenberger together forever with no Grissom in sight certainly earns the show a place on the DVR, even if I have to FF through the icky parts.
But a spoiler dropped this week turns out to be ickier than all of the carved corpses in creation.</description>

Jorja has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and, most recently, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be playing excerpts of songs she selected that have inspired her over the years, as part of KCRW&amp;rsquo;s Guest DJ Project.

Also lending a hand is the returning Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who drops in to relieve Catherine&amp;rsquo;s shorthanded staff. Helgenberger says the character, who is newly married(!), is a great deal happier than when we last saw her.
&amp;ldquo;When Sara left CSI, she&amp;rsquo;d had it and couldn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore. She needed a big break,&amp;rdquo; Helgenberger says. &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s in a much better place now.&amp;rdquo;

Just because we used to put asbestos in our walls, and we used to put lead in our paint, and it was a great idea at the time, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s still a great idea.</description>

8. Getting Fooled Again
The last time &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans saw Sara Sidle, Grissom had surprised her in the jungle in season 9 and the two shared a steamy kiss. Now Jorja Fox is back again for five &amp;#8212; count &amp;lsquo;em, five! &amp;#8212; episodes in season 10. Is Grissom next?

While executive producer Anthony Zuiker was mum and [Jorja] Fox was cagey on some high-tech opening sequence that she&amp;rsquo;d only say &amp;lsquo;will knock your socks off,&amp;rsquo; [Marg] Helgenberger showed a little leg, or tried to. &amp;lsquo;It starts with this technique, it&amp;rsquo;s this lack of better way of describing it &amp;ndash; these specialty cameras, almost this freeze-action kind of thing &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the opening yet, but it was very arduous shooting it.</description>

Voiceover: Jorja Fox was even there. She is making her return to the show this season.
Dayna Roselli: Did you ever think, in the beginning, that it would be going on this long?
Jorja Fox: No! Never in a million years. Nor did I ever think, in a million years, that there&amp;rsquo;d be a museum that has our mugs in it, in Vegas. It&amp;rsquo;s really - we&amp;rsquo;re all very overwhelmed and touched and thrilled to be here.</description>

Something I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize until I was a mature nerd was just how regularly, in TOS, Kirk and/or the rest of the crew of the Starship Enterprise violated the Prime Directive [&amp;hellip;]
Here&amp;rsquo;s where the idea for a new show in the Star Trek franchise comes in.
The show would focus on a set of characters who are the Star Fleet equivalent of an internal affairs bureau on a cop show.</description>

      <description>Less that a year after reuninting in the jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox is heading back to CSI this fall &amp;#8212; alone. But don&amp;rsquo;t take Fox&amp;rsquo;s five-episode to mean that Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s happily-ever-after was a bust. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re absolutely together,&amp;rdquo; insists executive producer, Naren Shankar, who nonetheless says Sara will drop hints at trouble in paradise. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a coulpe of very independant individuals who have decided to share their life together.</description>

New Project: Um &amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;
You Can Go Home Again: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled for Jorja&amp;rsquo;s return to &amp;lsquo;CSI,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The viewers and longtime &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode.&amp;rdquo;
Follow the (Ratings) Evidence: Looks like the addition of Laurence Fishburne hasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied viewers as much as producers had hoped, who acknowledge the drop in ratings and claim to be &amp;lsquo;listening&amp;rsquo; to fans who haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over last year&amp;rsquo;s departure of three original cast members.</description>

      <description>Just when I think we&amp;rsquo;ve heard enough about the developments on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; over the past week-Jorja Fox arriving for five episodes, and Lauren Lee Smith leaving entirely-then comes more. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve already heard some of these things, but I shall point your attention to this article&amp;rsquo;s title, somewhere up there. Yeah, exactly.
Executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar talked to &amp;ldquo;Entertainment Weekly**s Michael Ausiello, and discussed a little bit more about Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s return to the Las Vegas lab for the tenth season of the crime drama.</description>

      <description>Now that the initial burst of excitement surrounding Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s CSI comeback has died down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get down to business &amp;#8212; the business of getting answers to some burning questions! What prompted her return? How long will she be sticking around? What impact will Sara&amp;rsquo;s reappearance have on the rest of the team? And, last but not least, is Grissom next? CSI showrunners Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar tackle all those Qs and then some after the jump.</description>

Do you people listen to me? Well, some of you do, and the rest of you should. Months ago, I told you about a conversation I had with Jorja Fox when she left &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; At the time, she told me that she&amp;rsquo;d be coming back to the show the next season, but many of you scoffed&amp;ndash;it couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, I was told. And now, poof, she&amp;rsquo;s back. Foxy returns in the season premiere on September 24th, and will be back for additional episodes.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; season 10 will see a lot of Sara Sidle but none of Riley Adams.&amp;rdquo;
One person in, another is out. While Jorja Fox is welcomed back as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;, an actor has to be let go because the character is not working for the whole show. The unfortunate one would be Lauren Lee Smith aka Riley Adams, the crime investigator who joined the unit in season 9.</description>

      <description>I guess people didn&amp;rsquo;t really warm to Riley Adams after all.
Lauren Lee Smith is not going to be back for the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, executive producer Naren Shankar told TV Guide Magazine. And, much like the departure of Kim Delaney on her first season in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s because the character just wasn&amp;rsquo;t working well as everyone had expected.
&amp;ldquo;It was an issue of how we were feeling the ensemble was working,&amp;rdquo; Shankar said.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s official: Lauren Lee Smith is out on CSI, and Jorja Fox is back in! The prodigal star spoke exclusively to TVGuideMagazine.com about her return for at least five episodes.
So what prompted your return to CSI?
Right around March, I felt really rested and was itching to work&amp;ndash;I was ready and going to meetings and auditioning. When I was in Atlanta [filming a guest shot on Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s Drop Dead Diva], I got the call about CSI&amp;ndash;it was completely out of the blue!</description>

That was the other thing: burlesque&amp;ndash;or at least Dita&amp;rsquo;s burlesque&amp;ndash;is big here. Big space: held at Avalon, which has a capacity to hold a few thousand people, and was sold out. There were multitudes of celebrities in the audience: we spied Margaret Cho and Jorja Fox, (of CSI: Las Vegas), as well as Jenny Lewis (or at least her exact replica). The size of L.A.&amp;rsquo;s geography lends itself to making burlesque seem more than a quick and dirty striptease in a tiny hovel of a club in the Lower East Side.</description>

Item two: It won&amp;rsquo;t be that much of a reunion. The biggest item on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; front is the return of Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle; it&amp;rsquo;s been confirmed that she&amp;rsquo;ll be appearing in the tenth season premiere, and in yet-to-be-disclosed extra episodes. Obvious question is, is Grissom returning? William Petersen is, sadly, not returning to the role. At least not yet.
But executive producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed that some classic characters will be returning to the series.</description>

      <description>When Oscar-nominated film star** Laurence Fishburne** joined the cast of CSI, it seemed like a natural match. CBS was replacing departing star William Petersen with a well-known face and presence.
Best of all, the network&amp;rsquo;s core hit was adding a black man as star in the same month Barack Obama would take office as the nation&amp;rsquo;s first black president.
But after an initial boost in viewership, ratings have sagged for Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s version of CSI.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m worried about &amp;ldquo;CSIs future. Given the poor reception Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s character has been getting, is there any chance CBS will replace him? &amp;ndash; David**
TIM: Nope. A network rep notes that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was still the highest-rated scripted show of the 2008-09 season, and Fishburne was the show runners&amp;rsquo; dream replacement for William Petersen. Also, he&amp;rsquo;s only had half a season to win fans over. Hopefully his use of deadly force in the May finale will herald more of a bold, commanding Fishburne (think &amp;ldquo;Boyz n the Hood&amp;rdquo;) and less of the bookish Professor Langston.</description>

      <description>Oh, Sara Sidle. CSI just can&amp;rsquo;t quit you. Original series actress Jorja Fox will return for five episodes in the new season of the hit crime drama.
Jorja left the show in its eight season, but returned a few times last year in its ninth season for guest appearances. When we last saw Sara, she was caught in an embrace with her bearded boyfriend Gil Grissom, who had left the lab behind for good to meet her in the jungle.</description>

      <description>**Jorja Fox returning to CBS&amp;rsquo; hit drama for multiple episodes. **
What does an actor do when they have an open invitation to return to one of television&amp;rsquo;s biggest shows? Come back, of course.
Actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s revolving-door relationship with &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; continues to spin, as CBS today announced the news that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back to play the popular character Sara Sidle when the forensics drama returns in the fall. Fox left the show as a regular in 2007, but made a short return (and was last seen) during William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s final episode of the show last season.</description>

When enormously popular William Petersen left CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last season, the series fumbled a couple of million viewers; toward the end of the ninth season, the procedural crime drama was clocking some of its smallest crowds ever, though it remained the country&amp;rsquo;s most watched drama series.
What to do? CBS announced Monday that Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, Petersen&amp;rsquo;s employee and love interest, is returning to reprise her role for &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; episodes.</description>

      <description>Admit it, that question is very much a natural, not after that long string of events stretching way back to the seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;-Sara and Grissom finally address their relationship, the Miniature Killer gets in the way, she leaves to address her past, he leaves to move on (to her, natch)&amp;hellip;
But yes, just in case you still can&amp;rsquo;t believe what you&amp;rsquo;ve read elsewhere, Jorja Fox is returning to the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When last we saw actress Jorja Fox on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, her alter ego Sara Sidle was deep in the Costa Rican jungle, happily reunited with the love of her life, Gil Grissom. Well, apparently Sara&amp;rsquo;s going to have some very good reason to leave that romantic idyll because come this fall, Jorja Fox is returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; for five episodes.
There&amp;rsquo;s no indication that William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Gil is joining her, although since Petersen is still connected to the show as an executive producer, he could decide to pop in for a show or two.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox left the grimy Las Vegas crime scenes of &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; for sun, surf and soul searching. But now she&amp;rsquo;s set to return as Sara Sidle for a much anticipated five-episode arc on the series&amp;rsquo; 10th season (premiering Sept. 24 on CBS). There&amp;rsquo;s wild speculation around the circumstances of her visit &amp;#8212; Is another CSI in danger? Are Sara and Grissom still together? &amp;#8212; and AOL TV grilled her mercilessly for the juicy details.</description>

      <description>Following an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama&amp;rsquo;s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will &amp;ldquo;reappear&amp;rdquo; in a September 24th episode where viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in its upcoming season.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a rocky relationship for Fox and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, with the actress leaving and returning once before over salary and contract disputes.
Her return will only be temporary, as she&amp;rsquo;s just signed on to star in a handful of episodes for the season. Thus far.
We&amp;rsquo;d advise her not to look a gift horse in the mouth this time!</description>

      <description>Bah, we all somehow saw it coming, right? After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she&amp;rsquo;s arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; which aired yesterday.
That detail&amp;rsquo;s been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was announced.</description>

      <description>So much for Grissom and Sara&amp;rsquo;s happy ending!
Less than a year after walking off into the sunset jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as Sara for multiple episodes &amp;#8212; sans Grissom.
According to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn, Fox will reappear in the Sept. 24 episode when viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; team in Las Vegas.</description>

For the Spring/Summer 09 look, we were feeling pretty damned good about ourselves and went for a &amp;lsquo;top of the world&amp;rsquo; theme, deliciously shot on the rooftop of The Chapman Building (many thanks to GwG&amp;rsquo;s dear friend and loft tenant, Matthew Vafiadis!) The location was divine, but I have to admit the whole inspiration for our &amp;lsquo;world-topping&amp;rsquo; thing came once I knew the lovely Jorja Fox was on board to be our &amp;lsquo;model&amp;rsquo;.</description>

I have a whole new appreciation for Riley after &amp;lsquo;No Way Out&amp;rsquo; because any lady who takes pistol-whipping like that deserves hats off. I truly am looking forward to seeing Adams&amp;rsquo; character in depth, and Lauren Lee Smith is a talented individual. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she will soon become a favorite, and give the girl a break; it can&amp;rsquo;t be easy following in the footsteps of Jorja Fox. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Fox was so loved that some of the fans where near padlocking her to the set - not that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t donate a chain or two to that cause, as I am a die hard Sara Sidle fan and I miss her terribly, but we have to eventually move on guysâ¦.</description>

Summary It&amp;rsquo;s Neela&amp;rsquo;s last day and everyone in the ER seems to have forgotten that she is leaving. Neela proves she is ready to be an attending when she and Dr. Dubenko argue about the treatment of two surgical cases. Meanwhile, Brenner has an epiphany about his troubled past.
Character Review Doyle&amp;rsquo;s name is seen when Neela puts her nameplate on the wall of departed doctors.</description>

Dr. Maggie Doyle
&amp;lsquo;The first time Anthony Edwards directed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, he had this epic idea to shoot all of act two as one fluid Steadicam shot. We came in and rehearsed it all morning like a stage play.
The scene took place in the emergency room and included almost the entire cast and recurring cast and several guest actors &amp;ndash; maybe thirty actors altogether. If I remember right, the camera followed Laura Innes&amp;rsquo;s character, Dr.</description>

      <description>Crime Scene Investigation has long been the televisual highlight of the week in my house, so it was with some sadness that I tuned in last week to witness the apparent demise of one of the show&amp;rsquo;s greatest assets: the relationship between team supervisor Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). What made this portrayal of heterosexuality so notable was not anything intrinsically subversive about its set-up (older, more powerful guy gets it on with younger, more attractive woman) but the refreshingly non-formulaic way it was represented.</description>

 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Why, oh why, must it be Sara? Office romance is inevitable sometimes and their relationship was hinted at early on in the series.
 Understandably, working closely together at the crime lab and crime scenes leave little time for both Sara and Grissom to do any socialising. Plus, they share the same interests &amp;ndash; bugs, blood, logic.</description>

**20. Gil/Sara/Lady Heather, &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;
History: Forensic examiner Gil Grissom (William Petersen) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly lucky with the ladies. Dominatrix-turned-therapist Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) only comes into his life when she&amp;rsquo;s a murder suspect, when her daughter is murdered and when her kinky past is helpful to Grissom in solving a case. As for his subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), their relationship is only hinted at until he proposes in season 8.</description>

Is she or isn&amp;rsquo;t she Jorja Fox resumed her role on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as Sara Sidle, one of the hottest forensic scientists on the block. CBS had thousands of viewers popping antacids as they anxiously awaited word on whether the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer&amp;rdquo; had offed Sidle, his last victim. Thank God the network negotiated a deal to have Fox stick around for a few guest spots on season nine. Last week Grissom (William Petersen) passed the baton and said farewell to a life of blood and gore before showing up unexpectedly in the jungle to surprise Sara with a little monkey lovin&amp;rsquo;.</description>

Q CSI has been a hit since its debut. So why would the producers drop three of its biggest stars: William Petersen, Jorja Fox, and Gary Dourdan?
*&amp;ndash;Ala Smith, Clovis, Calif.*
A After eight years, viewers get tired of the same faces&amp;ndash;and actors get bored doing the same thing. Those three stars all left voluntarily. Incidentally, while Marg Helgenberger has survived the CSI upheaval, she and actor Alan Rosenberg recently separated after 19 years.</description>

      <description>Hell yeah!
With sincere apologies to the male fans, I&amp;rsquo;m going to believe the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; writers wrote this William Petersen swan song especially for me &amp;#8212; okay, me and the millions of other female viewers &amp;#8212; who believe a happy ending is possible for just about anyone, even a moody sleuth in a perpetual state of emotional lockdown. Sappy sendoff? Perhaps. Satisfying? You bet &amp;#8212; especially since the last cast member to take a permanent hike (alas, poor Warrick) did it in such a depressing and tragic manner.</description>

**Grissom&amp;rsquo;s farewell to &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;
SPOILER ALERT! Discussion of the final scene in Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s last episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; follows. Read on at your own risk.
That last scene in last night&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; saw Grissom (William Petersen) trekking through a Costa Rican jungle, coming upon Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and swooping her into his arms for a big Hollywood kiss. It was essentially a reverse of the way Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) departed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; with Doug Ross (George Clooney) coming back to fly away with her.</description>

      <description>The final moment of Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; career &amp;#8212; and the surprise first moment of the rest of his life &amp;#8212; were in the planning stages for two years.
That may be why the closing scene of Thursday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was so satisfying. Yes, we are going to discuss spoilers here, so run to your DVR or cbs.com and get caught up. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
The departure of William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character from in front of the camera was mapped out in long conversations between two of the show&amp;rsquo;s two executive producers, Petersen and co-star Jorja Fox, according to Carol Mendelsohn, one of the showrunners on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; who has been overseeing production of the show since episode one.</description>

A: According to industry sources, the film (which we first reported on in 2005) is very much on the fast track, and out writer/director Jessica Sharzer has just turned in a polish of her screenplay.
But Viacom and CBS reportedly have a competing project in the works produced by &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox and based on the live stage show Stay Forever: The Life and Music, written by and starring Kirsten Holly Smith.</description>

Question: Have we really seen the last of Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Last week&amp;rsquo;s ending of Episode 2 was heartbreaking. The creators have invested years hinting at, building up and finally revealing the relationship between Gil and Sara. I appreciate that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all hearts and flowers, but now that Petersen is leaving the show anyway, why not let these two tortured characters have a happy ending together? â Patrice</description>

      <description>I WAS shocked at the amount of wrinkle-relaxing poison in the face of Jorja Fox when I watched CSI last week. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any. She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.
She was back for Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues&amp;rsquo; face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn&amp;rsquo;t look remotely upset, even though she said she was.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised to learn that so many of you got choked up at the gut-wrenching scenes from Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, but I was taken aback by some commentary regarding Sara&amp;rsquo;s appearance &amp;ndash; namely, whether or not she was with child, and if her condition would eventually explain her abrupt decision to leave Las Vegas last season. All I can say is &amp;ndash; good God, no. Look, I hated her poofy dress (and the curls she wore with it) probably as much as the next fan, but never in my wildest dreams would I have considered she was trying to cover up a secret pregnancy.</description>

Catherine and Nick work the suicide, who threw herself off of her balcony, however the evidence contradicts the initial analysis as she had arranged a dinner with her soon to be in-laws for the next day and was getting married in two weeks.</description>

      <description>Synopsis After being shot by Undersheriff McKeen, who calls in the crime, Warrick is found by Grissom and dies in his arms. McKeen tries to frame another dirty cop, Pritchard, who killed Gedda and tried to frame Warrick. The CSIs try to solve the crime, and quickly exclude Pritchard from their suspect list and replace him with McKeen due to inconsistencies in McKeen&amp;rsquo;s report. From his phone records and the tiny partial off the bullets in the murder weapon, the CSIs trace McKeen to a hotel where he happens to have Pritchard holed up.</description>

      <description>None of us wanted her to go, least of all Gil Grissom &amp;hellip; so it&amp;rsquo;s great news that Jorja Fox, aka CSI Sara Sidle, will return to reprise her role in season nine. Fox is expected to appear in the first three episodes of the year as the team lay Warrick Brown to rest.
Don&amp;rsquo;t bank on any resolution to the truncated love-story between Grissom and Sara, though. As Fox recently told &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, talking about their feelings isn&amp;rsquo;t something the pair find easy: &amp;ldquo;As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous.</description>

As part of a cross-country tour, ADI spokesperson Fox presented Council Member Lee Leffingwell with a copy of the report. Referring to &amp;ldquo;The ABCD&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; acquisition, brutality, confinement, disposal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that are an inherent part of the circus industry, she highlighted the success of human-performer-only circuses like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese State Circus.</description>

      <description>Circuses advertise a joyful, colorful form of entertainment, but for circus animals, the shows hold dark promises of horrible living conditions that force animals into miserable confinements, according to animal advocacy groups.
Circuses featuring exotic animals may be banned from Austin in the future after Animal Defenders International, an animal rights group, presented an abuse report to the Austin City Council Friday.
The London-based group asked Austin City Council to ban these circuses in the city of Austin as part of the group&amp;rsquo;s nationwide campaign.</description>

&amp;ldquo;I think Jessica Simpson has every right to her opinion, but I&amp;rsquo;m not offended by it at all, because it was done in jest,&amp;rdquo; Fox assured me earlier today.</description>

Nerdiest Cop: Sara Sidle, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;
You gotta love her: She&amp;rsquo;s dry, supersmart, slightly damaged and obsessed with cadavers. The original &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t what you&amp;rsquo;d call a character-driven show, but Sara Sidle has more personality than all her co-workers combined. Too bad depression got the best of this geek guru. We can only hope for the surprise return of her character &amp;#8212; and, hopefully, no more lab explosions.</description>

Q Will actress Jorja Fox ever return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?&amp;ndash;Betty Rudder, Mascot, Tenn.
A We&amp;rsquo;ve received dozens of letters like yours since Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in November and told us she needed a break from the daily grind. She then turned down several TV movies to focus on producing a musical about the late singer Dusty Springfield, which was staged in L.A. earlier this year. But Jorja, who&amp;rsquo;ll turn 40 this week, always hoped to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, and fans will be thrilled to learn that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back on the season premiere this fall.</description>

Jorja&amp;rsquo;s Coming Back to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;
When Jorja Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last fall, producers promised it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the last fans would see of her. They&amp;rsquo;ll hold up their end of the bargain when the actress&amp;rsquo; Sara returns to the crime drama for it&amp;rsquo;s third episode next season. &amp;ldquo;It involves an old friend of Sara&amp;rsquo;s who has to confront a [life or] death situation with his wife,&amp;rdquo; she teases.</description>

      <description>Inside sources reveal top secrets about the season&amp;rsquo;s biggest burning questions
[&amp;hellip;]
Why did CSI&amp;rsquo;s Warrick have to die (and was the story line influenced by Gary Dourdan&amp;rsquo;s real-life troubles)?
&amp;ldquo;Executive Producer Carol Mendelsohn says&amp;rdquo;: We thought that if we ever lost Warrick [Dourdan], this was the way he would go. Warrick&amp;rsquo;s a local guy. The only family he had was Grissom [William Petersen] and the team, so this was not a guy who was going to leave Las Vegas or CSI.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans have not seen the last of Sara Sidle. In fact, the time has come for fans to welcome one of the key players of the forensic drama, Jorja Fox, whose character left the series in the season 7 episode &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck&amp;rdquo; where she had to go face the ghost of her past.
According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, the 39-year-old actress has just inked a deal to return for &amp;ldquo;CSI**s ninth season premiere next fall.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; boss Carol Mendelsohn wasn&amp;rsquo;t pulling my leg when she told me last October that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the last of Sara Sidle. Sources confirm that Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return for the show&amp;rsquo;s ninth-season premiere next fall.
Specifics of her comeback are being kept under lock and key, but my &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; mole assures me that she &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t be appearing in a flashback.&amp;rdquo; The likely scenario has Sara returning to Vegas to shag Grissom mourn ex-colleague Warrick, who was shot (and presumably) killed in last week&amp;rsquo;s finale.</description>

      <description>When Sara left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, driving out of Las Vegas on her way to who knows what, he left behind a brokenhearted Gil Grissom. The producers of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; were wise to keep the door open for the character to return, and that&amp;rsquo;s just what&amp;rsquo;s happening &amp;#8212; at least for one show. According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, Jorja Fox will be in the season premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. Oh, and she won&amp;rsquo;t be the only former cast mate on the show; so will Gary Dourdan as Warrick.</description>

Recycling, obviously, I think we&amp;rsquo;re all doing that in California. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed.

Question: What happened to Catherine finding the picture of Grissom and Sara that was teased all week? That scene sure wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; I watched on Thursday! â Kathy
Ausiello: Good question â let&amp;rsquo;s ask exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The scene where Catherine finds Sara&amp;rsquo;s picture on Grissom&amp;rsquo;s fridge is really fun. But the paradox of writing a procedural is that sometimes even our favorite scenes (scenes that show the personal lives of our CSIs) aren&amp;rsquo;t required by the narrative.</description>

Due to the limitations of this presentation, certain aspects of the show couldn&amp;rsquo;t be fleshed out &amp;lt;&amp;gt; making it somewhat unclear whether this was an actual play or a very good lounge act. What is undeniable is that Kristen Holly Smith is a goldmine of talent and knowledge (she co-wrote the piece).</description>

*Last Saturday (Mar 2) saw Jorja Fox with 3 non-celeb friends (2 guys and a girl) buying wine a bit after 10pm at CapNCork on Hillhurst in Los Feliz. She was in jeans, green shirt and white vest, hair down, no makeup and looking very casual but easily recognizable.

t was quite the celebrity day in Hollywood today. I just barely saved myself from looking like a total jackass to CSI star, Jorja Fox. Here&amp;rsquo;s the scoop: Being &amp;ldquo;on deck&amp;rdquo; at my voiceover agency to audition, means lingering my the desks of the assistants, who are awesome. I enjoy chit chat with the Tallest-Assistant-In-The-World, Jeff, who is almost 7 feet and hilarious. On Jeff&amp;rsquo;s desk last week, was a notice for a show at the LBGT Center, produced by Jorja Fox.</description>

      <description>If ever a TV couple shared some great chemistry it&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom.
But after years of successfully concealing their relationship from their colleagues - and from us - no sooner is the cat out of the bag, than Sara&amp;rsquo;s off.
So now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if maybe it was just the secrecy that was the real attraction for Sara, and the thought of being able to hold hands with Gil in the CSI canteen and drive in to work together each day is just too mundane for words.</description>

Speaking of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, former regular cast member Jorja Fox is now able to enjoy doing the other things she was raring to sink her teeth into when she decided to leave the show earlier this season. Since quitting as CSI Sara Sidle, Fox has had the opportunity to work on one of her dream projects.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m producing a musical about the life and music of Dusty Springfield called &amp;ldquo;Stay Forever&amp;rdquo; in Los Angeles at the Renberg theater,&amp;rdquo; Fox told Variety.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox and Kirsten Holly Smith talk about the life and music of Dusty Springfield.
For millions the music and life of Dusty Springfield has grand significance. More specifically, as a woman who was producing music in the man&amp;rsquo;s world of music making, a performer who professionally protested Apartheid (before it was de rigueur) and a household name who came out of the closet, Springfield&amp;rsquo;s music and life meant much more to specific groups such as women, blacks and gays.</description>

NZTVG: How did you feel about Jorja Fox (who plays Sara Sidle) leaving the show this season?
Marg Helgenberger: We only shot a couple of episodes more after she left but it was sad. Everybody reacted very differently and you don&amp;rsquo;t even really think about it until you have the party and it&amp;rsquo;s your last day and everyone shows up. Then it becomes the big, emotional thing. It hit some people really hard that day.</description>

What, what, what &amp;ndash; was that a real soul search, or was it &amp;ldquo;gee, it&amp;rsquo;s time&amp;rdquo;?

      <description>Can you please enlighten me about Jorja Fox/Sara leaving on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Surely CBS is not abandoning the romance story between her and Grissom after teasing us about it for over a year?! Will Sarah come back to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; show or have we seen the last of her? It would be a real bummer if she disappears from the show. I may quit watching if she goes!
1p6,1p6 Before Fox&amp;rsquo;s departure, it was widely reported that she and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; could not agree on a new contract.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Doing this show was one of the most rewarding things in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been one of the luckiest people in the history of TV getting to play Sara. My character had a full personal life, with a couple boyfriends, a couple meltdowns. She was almost killed a couple of times. They almost blew me up one! I feel like the writers were extremely generous in terms of giving me a lot to do, especially all the interesting relationship stuff between Sara and Grissom.</description>

      <description>REVIEW | Dazzling visuals set pace for TV procedurals, making departure of Fox or anyone else secondary
Jorja Fox fans surely will be bummed when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; returns with a new episode tonight. Fox left the show a few weeks ago, and she took away her character, Sara Sidle. But don&amp;rsquo;t expect &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; to suffer much because, duh, the true star of America&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 drama is its sci-fi special effects.</description>

      <description>Though Sara Sidle has already left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, fans of the forensic drama are still determined to convey their support to her portrayer, Jorja Fox.
Previously, fans combined their efforts to come up with a &amp;ldquo;Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign&amp;rdquo; to prevent the 39-year-old actress from leaving the show. When Fox officially exited the CBS series, the excess money raised by the crusade was donated to charity. And now that the campaign is over, a new drive is being created that aims to thank the former &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; actress.</description>

Your response to Sandra S.&amp;rsquo; question about whether Grissom and Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationship hurt &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was the most accurate evaluation of their romance and the last couple of seasons of the show that I&amp;rsquo;ve read. It was nice to see someone in the media not jumping on the &amp;ldquo;they turned the show into a soap opera!&amp;rdquo; bandwagon, which so many fans inexplicably have joined.</description>

Ausiello: I know that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty silly theory, considering what Carol Mendelsohn told me last month.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this by admitting that I was not a big Sara fan. I think I turned against Jorja Fox after the first contract dispute. To me, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is more of an ensemble show, so even though I have my favorites, *cough* Warrick *cough*, I resented the impression I got that she thought she was more important than any of the others. Besides that, I kinda wanted Lady Heather to loosen Grissom up a bit.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday marked the departure of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) from the long-running hit drama &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo;
Appearing as a guest co-host on &amp;ldquo;The View&amp;rdquo; this week, Fox says she&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fortunate&amp;rdquo; to have been a part of the series. She went on to say that the decision to leave was &amp;ldquo;the hardest decision I ever made.&amp;rdquo;
The actress is an original cast member from debut season in 2000, as a quasi love interest for lead investigator Gil Grissom.</description>

      <description>After eight seasons on one of TV&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated shows, Jorja Fox left the CBS drama &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; Thursday night.
Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the hot TV series, has told several publications that she decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the hardest decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made in my life,&amp;rdquo; Fox told Entertainment Weekly. &amp;ldquo;It has nothing to do with my contract, nothing to do with money.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck&amp;rdquo; was Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last appearance on the popular CBS series &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; after a seven-year tenure on the show.
Forensic scientist Sara Sidle, the character Fox had portrayed since 2000, was very popular with fans â so much so that, when the actress was fired in 2004. It was a temporary dismissal, as the public reacted strongly, demanding that she return.
Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s episode was the last Fox filmed as Sara Sidle and a worthy farewell for a notable character.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is probably a strong enough concept to survive cast changes, witness the success of the two spinoffs. But until now, its producers and CBS have never had to wonder. The original cast from the pilot episode-Petersen, Helgenberger, George Eads, Gary Dourdan, and Paul Guilfoyle-is still intact. Jorja Fox joined the cast for the second episode, and her Sara Sidle character becomes the first major departure from the show tonight.</description>

      <description>Question: Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; episode just aired, and that got me to thinking about all the brouhaha back when the relationship between Grissom and Sara was revealed in the Season 6 finale. At the time, there were dire predictions that this was the end of the rope for the series. It had become a soap, turned a corner, jumped the shark, etc. Looking back at it now, do you think that the romance &amp;ndash; its reveal, and the way it was woven into Seasons 7 and 8 &amp;ndash; was a detriment to the show?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.&amp;rdquo;
With this brief interchange, crime scene investigator Sara Sidle made her first appearance on the CBS hit show, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Yesterday, she made her final appearance. After a tumultuous seven years on the show, actress Jorja Fox finally packed up her fingerprint kit.
Fox enjoyed a long run of success with the show as a materials and element analysis specialist who was originally brought in during the first season by Gil Grissom (actor William Petersen) to do an internal affairs investigation.</description>

      <description>Which is the better way to go out, with a bang or a whimper? Unlike its Miami-based counterpart, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has never been about the bang. The flagship show&amp;rsquo;s characters are more cerebral, its sets dressed in somber blues. It may have made for better storytelling to have Sara Sidle die at the hands of the Miniature Killer, but her actual departure fit better with the show&amp;rsquo;s sensibilities.
[Sara didn&amp;rsquo;t have the sawdust to handle spoilers.</description>

      <description>For months, we&amp;rsquo;ve all known it was coming - the departure of a beloved &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; (8 p.m., KRQE News 13) character.
Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) makes her last appearance in tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode, and mostly this makes me sad.
She&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and complex character who truly bonds with people. I like her eccentricities, and while her hair will never be as cute as Catherine&amp;rsquo;s (Marg Helgenberger), she still manages to look good while knee deep in gross stuff.</description>

      <description>Fans put through ringer on Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s farewell episode
Do the creators of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; enjoy torturing their fans?
Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last appearance as a regular (Wednesday night at 9 on WBZ, Ch. 4) was bound to be difficult. &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck&amp;rdquo; is excruciating. Given the final moments, the title seems cruelly ironic.
CBS has asked that I refrain from any potential spoilers. If the network were serious, it would have gagged both Fox and the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers weeks ago.</description>

      <description>The time has finally come for fans to bid farewell to one of the key players of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. After seven years of playing Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox is ready to exit the forensic drama and move on. But before she leaves, the 39-year-old actress will be portraying her character one last time, giving closure to the &amp;ldquo;Grissom Sara Romance&amp;rdquo; many fans have learned to adore, in tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode entitled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck.</description>

      <description>Synopsis Hannah and Marlon West return as the prime suspects in the death of a college girl. Hannah killed the girl, Marlon&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend, because she was in love with him. When Marlon learned of his sister&amp;rsquo;s co-dependent adoration and that she was framing him for the murder (in order to lock him away so that only she could see him), he kills himself.
The two cases are just the final straws for Sara &amp;ndash; she leaves Las Vegas, and she leaves Grissom.</description>

      <description>Original &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; cast member Jorja Fox leaves the hit CBS drama Thursday night, but expect the series to be just fine without her.
&amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; which debuted in 2000, has been the most-watched scripted show on TV for the past five years, and its audience isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere.
&amp;ldquo;&amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; has built its success over the years by being more story-driven than star-driven,&amp;rdquo; Vincent Fitzgerald, who heads the communications department at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale, told the Daily News.</description>

      <description>AS if &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t de pressing enough, to night&amp;rsquo;s episode is devoted entirely to the disillusionment of Sara Sidle.
It&amp;rsquo;s the long-awaited episode in which sourpuss Sara (Jorja Fox) makes her exit from the show - finally.
Fox had been rumored to be on the way out last season when it seemed as if her character would not survive being pinned under a car in the cliff- hanging final episode following an &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo; engineered by the serial murderer known as &amp;ldquo;the miniature killer.</description>

      <description>Watch tonight&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and you too will understand why Jorja Fox - Sara Sidle - quit.
Murders, suicide, a drag and dump (whatever that is), woman with knife in back, pre-pubescent homicidal insanity&amp;hellip;all within 44 minutes. You&amp;rsquo;d quit too. One wonders what kind of toll this takes on an intelligent sensitive actress like Fox - year after year of it. She told &amp;ldquo;EW&amp;rdquo; that she wanted to start a family, but starting families requires a certain frame of mind, and &amp;ldquo;optimism&amp;rdquo; has to be a basic minimum requirement â optimism about life, your life, and the life of your unborn children.</description>

      <description>Beloved characters deserve fitting farewells, and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) receives one tonight from CSI.
The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; vividly makes you feel Sara&amp;rsquo;s disillusionment with her work. In witnessing an eerie case of domestic abuse, she remains oddly remote.
The real crisis for Sara, however, comes from familiar sources. Returning in creepy style are Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his genius little sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia).</description>

      <description>CSI is a curiosity. Long before the popular procedural drama became TV&amp;rsquo;s most-watched crime show, it bucked TV convention. CSI debuted on the same night and the same network as a slick, glossy remake of The Fugitive, one of TV&amp;rsquo;s most respected and fondly remembered classics. The conventional wisdom was that The Fugitive remake, starring a dashing Tim Daly, would be a hit, and CSI would be lucky if it played out the string for a season or two.</description>

      <description>Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m too well-adjusted to relate (and that would be a first), but Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) departs CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; (9 tonight) in the most unrealistic, only-on-TV way possible.
To really get into a critique of her departure would entail giving away things that CBS has asked critics not to reveal, but from my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s not how real people say goodbye to those they love.
The episode finds Sara confronting a case from her past when a crime in the present sends a coed plunging out a dorm room window.</description>

      <description>When I finally sat down to watch an advance copy of tonight&amp;rsquo;s CSI showing the exit of fan protest magnet Jorja Fox, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help thinking of Devon Pierce.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular blog reader, you know I wrote about Pierce weeks ago, outlining her efforts from a room in her father&amp;rsquo;s Dunedin hearing aid clinic to run a massive fan effort aimed at convincing CSI producers to keep Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle character on the show.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character is written out of CSI in a way that writes her off.
[&amp;hellip;]
As somebody who has never really understood the popularity of CBS&amp;rsquo;s three blockbuster CSI series, watching each episode is like getting random pokes from a tiny acupuncture needle every time something outlandish happens.
So watching an advance copy of tonight&amp;rsquo;s installment from the mothership CSI, the last episode featuring fan protest magnet Jorja Fox, felt a little like this:</description>

      <description>On last week&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, in the crossover stunt featuring &amp;ldquo;Without a Trace**s Jack Malone, Sara Sidle was shown as visibly shaken at an especially unsettling crime scene, walking away as if she&amp;rsquo;d had enough. Her psychological unease and emotional exhaustion had been well established even before last season&amp;rsquo;s cliff-hanger that left her trapped under a car in the desert, as fans wondered all summer if TV&amp;rsquo;s top procedural was going to kill off one of its own.</description>

Jorja Fox is one gutsy gal. After eight seasons on one of TV&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated shows, Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, is leaving. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t fired. She decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what she has told several publications. Will she be back? That&amp;rsquo;s what fans of the Sara-Grissom relationship want to know. After all, they are engaged. A season-finale surprise appearance might be the way to go, if you ask me.</description>

There are a couple of notable departures on television tonight, csistarting Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last regular appearance as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (9 p.m., CBS).
As you may already know, Fox &amp;ndash; who has had a sometimes contentious relationship with the folks who produce the series &amp;ndash; decided to bow out of the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; world earlier this year, giving the writers a chance to prepare a proper farewell to an important character.</description>

      <description>The TV hit series CSI will lose Jorja Fox as one of their starring actors.
Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; is leaving the show to pursue other opportunities. Fox has been on the show since it premiered in 2000.
Fox first broke the news in October that she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities before she gets too old.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character valuable to show, and she&amp;rsquo;s a role model, readers say
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. But whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves âCSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re more concerned that the show will suffer without her.</description>

In October, Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle on &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; since the show premiered in 2000, told EW.com she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities &amp;ldquo;before (she) gets too old.&amp;rdquo; We asked readers to weigh in on her departure, and while some fans were upset over the seemingly definite demise of GSR, others were practically jubilant.</description>

&amp;bull;If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (CBS, 9 ET/PT), you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard this was coming. Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably picked up on the signs the past few weeks, as Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle has given way to horror and despair.
Tonight, Fox says goodbye to Sara and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, exiting in a terrific episode that uses an old case (a child who tricked her back in 2006) to make her confront her current problems.</description>

After seven years of portraying the Las Vegas forensic scientist and one of the core players of the show, Jorja Fox has ultimately decided to move on and have a break from the commitment of a weekly television series. But before she leaves, she&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Sara one last time in the episode fittingly called &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; which airs on Thursday, November 15.</description>

November 8, 2007 proved a sad day for &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; fans when Sara Sidle left the Las Vegas Crime Lab for the last time. After escaping death at the nads of minature kill Natalie Kimble in the season eight opener &amp;ldquo;Dead Doll,&amp;rdquo; the gutsy CSI had struggled to settle back into her job, with even a marriage proposal from Grissom doing little to raise her spirits.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle leaves &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Thursday night. No matter how you feel about that development, the episode is tremendous. All actors who depart long-running series should receive such heartfelt, memorable sendoffs.
The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; skillfully makes you feel Sara&amp;rsquo;s disillusionment. She witnesses an eerie case of domestic abuse and remains strangely remote.
But the real crisis for Sara arrives with the return of Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his genius little sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia).</description>

Jorja Fox
This CSI is in desperate need of the style police. Hopefully she puts more of an effort into her post-CSI job hunt than she does into her wardrobe because this ensemble is seriously lacking in interest. The top is unflattering, the skirt is shapeless and the shoes look more orthopaedic than red carpet ready.</description>

Um, the job was just too much for her to, it was too much with her, and I think she knew that if she asked Grissom to go with her, even if he said yes, that would be the end of him, you know &amp;ldquo;(very emotional)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>It became official on Monday, when Jorja Fox, who plays the recovering alcoholic Sara Sidle on the still-enormously popular CBS crime show, CSI, confirmed to ew.com that she is leaving the show this fall.
There had been much speculation in the TV press that Fox was quitting in this, the show&amp;rsquo;s eighth season. Last season&amp;rsquo;s glimpses of Sara&amp;rsquo;s and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s personal lives (they are a couple) led close followers to believe that Sara was doomed as a character, as no love goes unpunished on this show.</description>

      <description>Well, I suppose this puts the nail in the coffin. Sorry, Sara Sidle fans.
Despite the promo taunting you all with a Gil-Sara marriage proposal, Jorja Fox has confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that she&amp;rsquo;s leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, saying she will appear in only five episodes this season.
&amp;ldquo;There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old,&amp;rdquo; explains Fox.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox &amp;ndash; the 39-year-old actress whose tenure on TV&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 drama almost ended in 2004 when she was temporarily fired during tense contract negotiations &amp;ndash; has quit the show. She wrapped production on the drama last week. Fox told EW.com exclusively that her decision to give up the role of Sara Sidle had nothing to do with money and everything to with wanting a break from the commitment of a weekly television series.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The actress will hang up her badge in November.&amp;rdquo;
ET confirms that JORJA FOX will be leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo; She will exit the long-running drama sometime in November.
In last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger, it was unclear whether Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, investigator Sara Sidle, would be returning to the show, as her life hung in the balance after she was attacked by the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer.&amp;rdquo;
Fox, who has also starred on &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ER,&amp;rdquo; has been on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; since its beginning in 2000.</description>

      <description>TV executives all over Hollywood must just want to beat Nina Tassler like a gong. The CBS Entertainment chief brought back &amp;ldquo;Jericho&amp;rdquo; for a deserved midseason run and admitted that the &amp;ldquo;Nuts to CBS&amp;rdquo; campaign by fans was a factor in the show&amp;rsquo;s survival. Now every Comic Book Guy and No. #1 Fan out there is managing a campaign to save their favorite canceled show or fired actor. Aside from &amp;ldquo;Jericho&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Cagney and Lacey&amp;rdquo; back in the &amp;lsquo;80s, there&amp;rsquo;s seldom any sign that these campaigns are effective.</description>

      <description>You may have read that Gary Sinise got a healthy salary bump this week. He&amp;rsquo;ll now be pulling down $5 million a year for scowling on CSI: NY. No mention of any increase for his costar, Melina Kanakaredes.
If this television season has taught us anything, it&amp;rsquo;s that women in prime time shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for raises - unless they are prepared to see their characters tortured or killed.
Take Jorja Fox, who has a history of playing contract hardball with the CSI mothership.</description>

Q: I heard that Jorja Fox is leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; I know she had contract disputes a few years back, but I thought that had been sorted out.
&amp;#8212; A Reader
A: Jorja&amp;rsquo;s contract expired last season, and it apparently has not been renewed. Back in 2004, she and co-star George Eads infamously held out for more money and were unceremoniously fired from the top-rated crime drama. Shortly thereafter they were rehired &amp;#8212; at the same rate they had been paid previously.</description>

      <description>As fans continue to fret about whether Jorja Fox will walk away from her six-figure gig on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, an insider tells EW.com that the Oct. 18 episode will feature a very unorthodox marriage proposal by Gil to Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara. So far, very little has been revealed about the duo&amp;rsquo;s clandestine relationship, though fans first got an idea that something was up in the season finale two years ago, and over last season, when Sara was seen sitting up in bed with Gil (William Peterson) in one episode.</description>

      <description>Synopsis As the weather breaks 110+ in Las Vegas, deaths are more common but less common place. A homeless man dies in an alley, a married couple are killed in a seedy hotel room, and a bee dies in mid-flight.
The couple in the hotel room were killed by their 12 year-old daughter, who they thought was possessed by a devil, and kept her locked in an attic room much of the time.</description>

Scenes filmed on campus involved series regular Jorja Fox, who plays Crime Scene Investigator Sara Sidle, and guest star Juliette Goglia, who&amp;rsquo;ll be reprising her role as Hannah West, a 12-year-old genius introduced in the sixth season episode, &amp;ldquo;The Unusual Suspect.&amp;rdquo;
Filmed on the quad outside of Eucalyptus Hall, the crime scene features Sidle speaking with West and showing her photograph. Sidle&amp;rsquo;s words and the photograph provoke West, who becomes upset and starts crying and shouting at her.</description>

      <description>A ratings juggernaut like &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hardly needs the help of a rabid fan campaign. But after news that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox would be quitting the show, Internet crazies started rallying together to keep her fighting TV crime.
So far, online group Dollarforsense.com has deluged CBS&amp;rsquo;s offices with whack-job gifts in the hopes of keeping Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, on the show. So far, their stunts have stopped just short of being mistaken as the calling cards of one of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s rotating cast of psycho killers.</description>

Will do, and best of luck.

So far, they&amp;rsquo;ve orchestrated three airplane flyovers in the airspace above the Universal lot in Los Angeles (with &amp;ldquo;Save Jorja&amp;rdquo; banners) and sent $3,500 in cash to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; production offices (to help offset Fox&amp;rsquo;s six-figure salary).</description>

Best of the Week #2: CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION
It has to be acknowledged that for the first time, fans are finally given a glimpse into the Grissom/Sara backstory. The interaction between the two this week was an example of âhow it&amp;rsquo;s done&amp;rsquo;, acting-wise. As a friend of mine pointed out, it was like watching fan fiction come to life. And with Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s impending departure, that symbolic last scene was just heartbreaking for a die hard GSR shipper like myself.</description>

Ausiello: I actually just screened the episode, but CBS personally pleaded with me via a standard form letter to refrain from revealing the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of Sara&amp;rsquo;s departure. All that leaves me to scoop is the &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s a vehicle of some sort), the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s at night) and the &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; (the episode&amp;rsquo;s final frame is a close-up of someone other than Sara).</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Scene&amp;rsquo; and unseen**
Jorja Fox will leave the long-running hit &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; next month, TV Guide reports. She&amp;rsquo;s been there seven years, although she and co-star George Eads were temporarily fired after a salary dispute in &amp;lsquo;04.
This is, I think, not a bluff. She&amp;rsquo;s been bitter since that previous contract trouble, and turned down a modest raise then because it entailed a one-year extension.
She told the mag she regrets not working any longer with co-star William Petersen: &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s the most incredible scene partner I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had and he&amp;rsquo;s a great friend.</description>

      <description>Sara sidles out
Sara Sidle, the lab technician character on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; may have survived the first episode of the show&amp;rsquo;s new season. But she won&amp;rsquo;t make it to the last installment.
Jorja Fox, who has played the role on the hit CBS series since it began in 2000, will not complete the current season and will leave after the seventh episode in November, E! Online reports.
Her departure comes after rocky contract negotiations offscreen and an onscreen story line that has been foreshadowing for months a less than happy ending for her character.</description>

      <description>When &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ended last season, the fate of lab tech Sara Sidle was up in the air, both on and off the screen. Viewers were left wondering whether the character would survive, especially since the actress that plays her, Jorja Fox, had not yet renewed her contract. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fox finally made up her mind and will leave the hit show by the end of the year.
Fox will continue to star as her character until the end of 2007, after which she will exit the show.</description>

Jorja Fox to sidle off
TVGuide.com&amp;rsquo;s Michael Ausiello reports that even though the &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; character Sara Sidle survived her run-in with the Miniature Killer in Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s gripping season premiere, her time on the show has nonetheless come to an end.
Multiple sources confirm that Jorja Fox &amp;#8212; whose contract expired at the end of last season &amp;#8212; will depart the hit procedural in November, after failing to come to terms on a new long-term deal.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; character, Sara Sidle, survived a harrowing run-in with a killer in Thursday&amp;rsquo;s season premiere, but now it seems Fox is a goner.
Reports at TVGuide.com and EOnline.com yesterday have Fox leaving the crime series in November. Her contract expired in May, and there&amp;rsquo;s been speculation for months that she would exit the show.
Fox was nearly fired in 2004 over a contract dispute.
Word of her departure came just as CBS was celebrating big numbers for Thursday&amp;rsquo;s telecast, which averaged 25.</description>

      <description>There was much speculation about whether or not Sara Sidle would make it out alive from her encounter with &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Miniature Killer. While the season premiere answered that question, the resolution was overshadowed by word that despite surviving, Sara is still not long for the CSI world &amp;hellip; because Jorja Fox, the actress who plays her, will be leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.
Although it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been definitively confirmed, multiple sources have said that she will be leaving the show this November, after failing to arrive at a resolution for a new contract.</description>

      <description>Sara Sidle is a survivor. The actor that plays her, not so much.
Jorja Fox, who has starred on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; since its inception in 2000, will not complete the series&amp;rsquo; current season, bowing out after the seventh episode in November, E! Online TV columnist Kristin Dos Santos reports.
The news will no doubt be a blow to fans of the actress, albeit not a surprising one.
Her departure comes after rocky contract negotiations offscreen and an onscreen story line that has been foreshadowing for months a less than happy ending for her character.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s outta there.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I can tell you about Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s status on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, the hit series that bested &amp;ldquo;Grey**s in the ratings last night.
As I mentioned on &amp;ldquo;E! News&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday [&amp;hellip;], reliable sources close to the show tell me Jorja will not be a part of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as of the seventh episode of the current season.
So, do not let the fact that Sara Sidle survived last night&amp;rsquo;s premiere fool you.</description>

      <description>**Jorja Fox Leaving &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;
The actress will appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the top-rated show that made her a household name
&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox &amp;ndash; who was briefly fired from the show in 2004 during an ugly contract dispute with CBS &amp;ndash; is expected to leave the top-rated drama before year&amp;rsquo;s end. A source close to the show confirms that Fox, whose contract expired last season, has agreed to appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the show that made her a household name and turned her into an unwilling poster child for greedy TV actors.</description>

      <description>SARA lives.
Lab tech Sara Sidle sur vived last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger ending of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; fans of the show learned last night in the premiere episode of the series&amp;rsquo; eighth season.
The survival of Sara, who was left to die in the Las Vegas desert by the serial murderer known as &amp;ldquo;the miniature killer&amp;rdquo; - for the miniature models of crime scenes she would build and leave for CSI investigators - means cast member Jorja Fox will be sticking around for a while on the top-rated CBS drama.</description>

      <description>The day finally arrived: &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; fans finally know if Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, survived or not. Last year&amp;rsquo;s finale had the CSI team not only continue their search for the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer&amp;rdquo; but also for Sara, who became the killer&amp;rsquo;s last victim. There was a lot of speculation over the summer surrounding Sara&amp;rsquo;s fate especially since the show was doing its best to keep it a secret (fans were told they would at least see Sara under the car in the premiere but didn&amp;rsquo;t say more).</description>

      <description>The eighth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; traverses a tense path that long-time fans of the show will find familiar: a race-against-time CSI team effort to find one of their own, left to die in the desert by a vengeful killer.
Last time this happened, the intended victim was Nick (George Eads), buried alive - but eventually rescued - in an episode directed by Quentin Tarantino. This time, Nick is one of the team members using all his skills and instincts to help his colleague, Sara (Jorja Fox), escape a similar fate.</description>

      <description>The pros and cons on how last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger might end
The seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ended earlier this year with crime scene investigator Sara Sidle trapped under an overturned vintage muscle car, her hand twitching with faint signs of life. Back at the Las Vegas lab, Sara&amp;rsquo;s boss and secret lover, Gil Grissom, finished his interrogation of a psychotic young cleaning woman who turned out to be the lab&amp;rsquo;s season-long nemesis, the Miniature Killer.</description>

      <description>Sara Sidle is carrying a heavy weight on her shoulders these days.
When the eighth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; opens, Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character will still be where she was at the end of May&amp;rsquo;s finale: stuck under a car in the Nevada desert, courtesy of a psycho killer &amp;#8212; and Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract negotiations with CBS.
But while producers promise to resolve this cliff-hanger one way or another (though they&amp;rsquo;re staying silent about Fox&amp;rsquo;s fate &amp;#8212; hmmm, she&amp;rsquo;s not in the network&amp;rsquo;s cast shot, left), they do say her costars will be carrying their share of dramatic weight this season.</description>

Exit Wounds: Despite talk of Fox&amp;rsquo;s departure, &amp;ldquo;Sara does interact with the killer in the premiere,&amp;rdquo; coexec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells Us -but later adds, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a Kleenex for that episode.

      <description>So what is happening with Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?
The character appeared to have been crushed under a car as the Season 7 finale ended, and all summer blogs have buzzed with speculation about actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract negotiations with CBS. Does it mean anything that Fox wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a recent &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cast photo in TV Guide?
Sidle, as fans know, was in a relationship with Gil Grissom (William Petersen), and the entire &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; team found out about the romance in the season finale.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation CBS. Thursdays, 9 p.m. Humor and personality distinguish America&amp;rsquo;s favorite scripted series from so many other &amp;ldquo;procedurals,&amp;rdquo; and last season was perhaps its best. When it ended, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s secret girlfriend, Sara, was lying pinned under a car, and rumors abound that Jorja Fox, who plays her, is leaving the show. Sexy Jessica Lucas (&amp;ldquo;Life as We Know It&amp;rdquo;) has been signed as a hotshot new CSI.</description>

If you watch &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; at all, then you are likely aware of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s reported contract difficulties. At the end of this past season, viewers were left with an image of her character, Sara Sidle, trapped under a wrecked sports car in the middle of nowhere. Signs of life were, shall we say, limited. For &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans, the debate has been raging since before the finale ever aired about whether or not Sara would survive the crash.</description>

      <description>Like other actors on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; franchise, William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) feel fortunate to portray their respective characters and to be part of such an award-winning series.
Petersen, 54, reveals that science was something he was never really good at. But since landing the role of the forensic entomologist, he has developed a keen interest in the field and has seen some surprising changes in his personality.</description>

      <description>Sneak Peek CSI
Instead of using &amp;ldquo;Who Are You?&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s theme song this year, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers might want to consider the Clash&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Should I Stay or Should I Go.&amp;rdquo;
In last spring&amp;rsquo;s season finale, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) was left trapped under a car in the Nevada desert by a serial killer &amp;#8212; with pouring rain threatening to drown her &amp;#8212; while Gil Grissom (William Petersen), her boyfriend and boss, and the rest of the CSIs frantically tried to find her.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; adds new cast member
Jessica Lucas is joining the cast of CBS&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; as a recurring.
She will play Veronica Lake, aka Ronnie, a young, vivacious, smart, sought-after newbie CSI in training who gets multiple job offers but chooses to go to Las Vegas because of the increase in crime rates there.
Ever since the role cropped up on breakdowns around town, it prompted speculation that the character might be groomed as a replacement for Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who was left crushed under a car with her hand barely moving in the Season 7 finale.</description>

We were strolling along the sandy shores of Venice Beach, LA, in search of hot surfer chicks when we bumped into rather famous actress and lesbian icon Jorja Fox, fresh from a wave-riding session.
You may know her as the firm but fair Sara Sidle from the popular TV crime series &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

MsMzz said: Any news on CSI and the Jorja Fox situation?
CSI: The decision has not been officially announced yet. The only word I got about it was the rumor saying that she would be back for 1 episode and that&amp;rsquo;s it. POLL TIME!

Let&amp;rsquo;s check our POLL!
CSI: 75% of voters want Jorja Fox to remain on the show&amp;hellip; we should soon learn if your wish will be granted.</description>

      <description>On the heels of news that Rory Cochrane is returning to one of the other CSI shows, CSI: Miami, comes this news: Jorja Fox is probably on her way out.
CSI Producer Carol Mendolsohn tells TV Guide&amp;rsquo;s Michael Ausiello that they have just cast a new female lab technician that will be introduced in the third episode, and there are hints that she&amp;rsquo;s not just a new cast member but a new cast member that will take over for Jorja Fox, whose Sara character might die in that car crash.</description>

      <description>Who are you? Looks like &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers are making way for a replacement for Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle. A new female character, a CSI or lab tech in her 20s, will turn up in the season&amp;rsquo;s third episode. Sara was last spotted in a car wreck, meaning she probably won&amp;rsquo;t survive. What is known is that Fox will appear in the Sept. 27 season premiere â but under the car.</description>

      <description>Although &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hasn&amp;rsquo;t even pronounced Sara dead yet, it sounds suspiciously like the powers-that-be are already planning to breathe new life into the show by introducing a replacement for Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s hot cop.
Executive producer Carol Mendolsohn has told me exclusively that a new female character will turn up in this season&amp;rsquo;s third episode. &amp;ldquo;[She] may be a CSI or lab tech,&amp;rdquo; the boss said. And, according to my casting spies, the junior detective will be in her mid-twenties, fresh out of college and lacking the capacity for self-censorship.</description>

Tell me more.
&amp;ldquo;We have a big storyline finish at the start of the season,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It will play out for a few episodes. &amp;hellip; The ambition of their [the writers&amp;rsquo;] stories is once again extremely high and extremely quirky. That arc worked so well with Grissom and Sara, that we are going to let these characters breathe this year.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox &amp;ldquo;(on Billy Petersen leaving the show for four weeks in November of 2006)&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed at all, I think, you know, obviously as I met Billy he had come almost directly out of this excitement of theater he was doing in Chicago and he&amp;rsquo;s very famous for that theater that he&amp;rsquo;s done. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s been the heart of his work over the time of his career, he&amp;rsquo;s done some films that are ground-breaking and memorable and everybody, those, that&amp;rsquo;s probably the way that the most people know Billy Petersen, but I think that people who know Billy Petersen &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; that his heart and his soul has always been in the theater, so, and it&amp;rsquo;s almost as if in a sense odd that it took him six years to find his way into one, you know, and I think that it&amp;rsquo;s a testament to the show, how much &amp;ldquo;CSI:&amp;rdquo; has all this passion that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t felt like he could go do a play at the same time.</description>

While cast and crew remain tight-lipped on the details, we can reveal that the violent outcome has a major bearing on another of the show&amp;rsquo;s most intriguing storylines &amp;#8212; the clandestine relationship between Grissom and his fiesty colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox).
As the CSI team tries to track down the killer, Sara goes missing and her secret relationship with Grissom is forced into the open.
Whether Sara becomes another victim of the mini-replica killer remains to be seen, especially in the light of speculation over Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s future on the show.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
On CBS&amp;rsquo; CSI, a series that&amp;rsquo;s not too concerned with personal lives, Jorja Fox has made her Sara a tough, world-weary pro who&amp;rsquo;s also a vulnerable woman hopelessly involved with her enigmatic equal, Gil Grissom. Hopefully, her previous shunning by the academy is a crime that Emmy voters will take time to investigate - and solve.

In the photos, Fox was inexplicably dressed in khaki pants worn UNDERNEATH a pretty sundress, posing with Thora Birch, who looked like she had no idea how to stand in front of the &amp;ldquo;red carpet&amp;rdquo; camera.</description>

      <description>Every lesbian&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star, Jorja Fox, isn&amp;rsquo;t your average sexpot. The attractive but geeky tomboy hasn&amp;rsquo;t graced the pages of Vogue, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t spend each episode in impossibly high heels, and you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to find her at a PETA rally protesting animal cruelty than pitching Revlon products to you from a talk show on the Oxygen Network. That&amp;rsquo;s why we love her and her strong, sexy brand of androgyny and even her slightly intoxicating don&amp;rsquo;t-care-to-talk-about-my-personal-life attitude.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about going from the beginning of this season. We&amp;rsquo;d ended last year with the reveal of Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s relationship and had been doing that dance of who in the lab is going to know.</description>

No, 7 years, you become very, very, very, very, very close to that character in ways that, uh, are difficult to describe. So intrinsically as an artist, y&amp;rsquo;know, my desire is to protect that character and keep that character safe.</description>

Way back then, viewers were just coming to terms with his secret relationship with Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). And in the finale, according to Shankar, &amp;ldquo;this is the episode where Grissom goes public about the relationship&amp;rdquo; after Sara suddenly disappears. Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract with the show is up at the end of this season, and the network has no comment on wether she&amp;rsquo;ll be returning next season. Shankar will only admit that the situation Sara finds herself in &amp;ldquo;will have some significant ramifications for her relationship with Grissom.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never watched any of those &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; shows &amp;ndash; except for the Faye Dunaway episode! But, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking out for Jorja Fox, since we&amp;rsquo;re both alums of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC. Alas, the actress&amp;rsquo; future with CSI is in jeopardy. There&amp;rsquo;s the well-documented salary dispute she and co-star George Eads had (they walked out, CBS said fine, they came back without a raise). Now we hear that when the show wanted to film Foxy&amp;rsquo;s death scene, she refused to show up on the set &amp;ndash; smart girl!</description>

Beware of possible spoilers for the upcoming season finale, set to air May 17.
Previously it was reported that her character was set to go missing, but this week the New York Post reported that her character was slated to die in a car accident because of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s ongoing contract dispute with the show.</description>

And &amp;hellip; SPOILER ALERT &amp;hellip; Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is apparently a goner due to a salary dispute, but she apparently got some revenge by refusing to show up to shoot the death scene.
Her spokesperson says she did eventually show up, but The &amp;ldquo;New York Post&amp;rdquo; says the show had already done an alternate ending.

Another ongoing storyline this season has been the secret romance between Grissom and Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX). Because of that, Thea, who watched as Billy Petersen interrupted her interview with Marg to plant a big kiss on his co-star&amp;rsquo;s mouth, had to ask where he sees his on-screen romance going.
&amp;ldquo;Grissom and Sara have had a relationship for a while,&amp;rdquo; he points out. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know for how long and in what way, but they have, obviously, had a relationship for a long time.</description>

Jorja on our minds
That Jorja Fox is one feisty &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; No wonder Grissom loves her.
According to the &amp;ldquo;Star&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;New York Post&amp;rdquo;, Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit CBS show, was supposed to bite the Las Vegas desert dust in this season&amp;rsquo;s sweeps finale, but she&amp;rsquo;s refused to show up for work to shoot her death scene.
&amp;ldquo;Her contract is up and they are in conversations,&amp;rdquo; said a CBS spokeswoman.</description>

      <description>Jorja has a raise on her mind. The star of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; staged a one-day walkout from the set during the shoot of the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s season finale, which airs May 17. The actress is in talks with producers about a new contract to keep her on the show, sources familiar with the discussions tell TV Guide. How those talks go may decide the result of the cliff-hanging finale in which Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, is struck by an automobile.</description>

CBS sources say the network decided to kill her off after failing to come to a salary agreement for next season. Only Fox refused to show up on set, meaning expensive reshoots with Marg Helgenberger.

The New York Post is reporting that Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, was being written off the forensics drama because show execs weren&amp;rsquo;t happy with her contract demands, one of which was a &amp;ldquo;major raise&amp;rdquo; from her $100,000 US per episode.</description>

      <description>Underneath the crime scenes and forensic labs on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; lays one of the show&amp;rsquo;s most compelling mysteries: the relationship between Gil Grissom, head of the crime lab, and investigator Sara Sidle.
Their relationship, which has been suggested went back years before the series began at a seminar in San Francisco, has evolved from season to season.
And as the seventh season of the show comes to a close, the situation could turn sour for the crime-scene couple.</description>

      <description>The first thing that I notice about Jorja Fox is how quick she is to laugh. It&amp;rsquo;s a little disarming, considering her character on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Sara Sidle, is not known for her jovial sense of humor. Disarming, yet infectious and even over the phone, its feels less like an interview and more like we&amp;rsquo;re kicking back a few beers in a local pub and sharing stories.
She talks to PopGurls about the community on CSI, the Grissom/Sara relationship, Eric Szmanda&amp;rsquo;s influence and being homeless in Europe at 17.</description>

      <description>Because I like stirring up &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post this summary of what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen on the May 17 season finale of the CBS show. Standard spoiler alert: Avert your eyes if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to know.
You&amp;rsquo;ll recall that a year ago, fans of the show were either really happy or really angry that a romantic relationship between Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) was revealed.</description>

      <description>Actress Jorja Fox is a committed environmentalist and animal rights activist. As I&amp;rsquo;ve just seen in an amusing video, she&amp;rsquo;s also really into biking. The clip shows Jorja and SpinDaily host, Katherine, Orange20 Bikes in LA and checking out all the new models &amp;ndash; from hybrid to fixed gear. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty candid take on their time there with Jorja and Katherine performing &amp;ldquo;ride-bys&amp;rdquo; while singing songs. As Cyclelicious points out, there are also some great quotes:</description>

      <description>Every young actress with ambition hopes to make it in movies. But if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out the way you wanted, television can be a great alternative for a successful career. A great example of this is Jorja Fox (38).
She has appeared on the hit series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] for six years. Previous, she appeared on two other hit series: [[ER]] and [[The West Wing]].
Anyone who tries to remember her movies, probably comes up with [[Memento]].</description>

Ellen DeGeneres focused on the word itself, telling Extra: &amp;ldquo;This particular word is thrown around all the time at the workplace, at the playground, on the sports field and no one gets outraged. Hopefully this incident will put an end to this and people will stop using this word and other hateful words once and for all.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s hope the insanity stops here, and that Jorja Fox isn&amp;rsquo;t forced to drop by Ellen to tearfully recount the time Gil Grissom called her a &amp;ldquo;greedy rugmuncher&amp;rdquo; upon discovering she ate the last craft service banana.</description>

According to Mendelsohn, his departure will cause tension in that relationship, the source of which will become clear in a future episode &amp;#8212; when Grissom will try to make things right by &amp;ldquo;sending Sara (Jorja Fox) something.

      <description>Number one all around the world, CSI is apparently still at the top of its game. One could be forgiven for thinking that after seven seasons and two spin-offs, the genre would have completely lost steam, but that&amp;rsquo;s not taking into account the talent of the writers and the quality of the actors. We went to talk to the team behind the show to find out what they have in store for us in Season seven and how the show has managed to remain as fresh as ever.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox takes time off from playing CSI&amp;rsquo;s forensics investigator Sara Sidle to show us around the set of the hit TV Show
###The crime lab###
&amp;ldquo;We have one of the best equipped labs in the US, even though it&amp;rsquo;s only TV. A lot of the equipment is given to us by the companies that make it, and there&amp;rsquo;s a technical expert with us every day. I could probably use the equipment to fingerprint and identify body fluids, but most other things vanish from my brain as soon as I do them.</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;9 Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle on &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
Last spring, in the last minute of the last episode of the season, Grissom (William Petersen) looked up from his bedtime reading at Sara (Jorja Fox) in the bathroom door, fresh from a shower. All this reticent fall, they haven&amp;rsquo;t touched and barely smiled, but their intimacy has a resounding vibe.

      <description>As forensic sleuth Sara Sidle on the hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox has had her share of murders to solve. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a professional to figure out who the perpetrator is behind the deaths of the billions of animals killed for food every year &amp;#8212; namely, the meat industry. That&amp;rsquo;s why Jorja &amp;#8212; a longtime vegetarian &amp;#8212; jumped at the chance to shoot a provocative new pro-vegetarian ad for her friends at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia-Pacific.</description>

WITH HER TOMBOYISH demeanor and love of rock music, surfing, beer and dogs, no one, least of all actress Jorja Fox, would have predicted that she&amp;rsquo;d be in one of the most talked-about love affairs on TV this season.</description>

      <description>Translated from French
The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in season seven?
The producers keep it secret. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven&amp;rsquo;t though about killing Sara. She&amp;rsquo;s had almost everything else happen to her &amp;#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating &amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s been the team&amp;rsquo;s scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s as if those procedural dramas, after spending years putting female crime victims through the wringer (and inside locked cages and under floorboards) have run out of ideas and moved on to harassing female crime fighters instead.
Yet it&amp;rsquo;s also the case that many shows &amp;#8212; facing softening ratings after many years on the air or tougher time-slot competition &amp;#8212; are attempting to inject more personal story lines into a genre that once regarded them like germs in the crime lab.</description>

Jorja Fox said that when she auditioned for the role of Sara, the &amp;ldquo;tiny little character description &amp;hellip; suggested that she was a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s played Sara Sidle in the hit American forensics drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for six years, but Jorja Fox says she still isn&amp;rsquo;t bored with the role.
Unfortunately though, some of her scenes still make her stomach turn, which is a bit of a problem for someone playing a forensic scientist.
&amp;ldquo;I had a bit of an epiphany about it this year. I&amp;rsquo;m not squeamish in general and I realised that it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m looking at that makes me squeamish, it&amp;rsquo;s the why and the how.</description>

LOVE, EXCITING AND IN THE WORKS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME: The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-finale shocker that Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) are an item wasn&amp;rsquo;t a spur-of-the-moment fling. It&amp;rsquo;s been in the works for six years, Fox said at the Television Critics Association&amp;rsquo;s summer meeting.
&amp;ldquo;In this tiny little character description that you get when you&amp;rsquo;re trying out for a show, it suggested that she was a love interest for Gil Grissom,&amp;rdquo; Fox said.</description>

      <description>For her part, Fox says she was &amp;ldquo;thrilled&amp;rdquo; to get the script pages with that intimate scene between Grissom and Sidle.
&amp;ldquo;I had sort of been gearing up from the beginning of the show that that might happen,&amp;rdquo; she told critics during the press session, noting that it&amp;rsquo;s never been entirely clear, even to those who work on the show, whether the two were an item before either arrived in Las Vegas to work as crime scene investigators.</description>

Jorja Fox says of her storyline: &amp;ldquo;The idea right now going into season seven, if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken, is that Grissom and Sara are the only people, and the beautiful audience, that know this is actually taking place.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation caught almost everyone off guard in the season finale when it was revealed that Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, the characters played by William L. Petersen and Jorja Fox, have had a thing going on for goodness knows how long.
Who knew?
Actually, Fox did. Given that the series has been almost all business, it might seem the detour into romance is a reaction to the move of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy into the Thursday-night-at-9 time slot this fall.</description>

CSI: Pasadena Since I took the liberty of skipping the CBS Digital Media Presentation (sorry; just say the word &amp;ldquo;multiplatform&amp;rdquo; to yourself about 75 times, and I swear it&amp;rsquo;ll be just like you were there), the last session of the day was for Television&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 Drama. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch this program (because I figure enough people do), so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what sorts of significant things were said.

Now, the biggest mystery on the show doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve the victim of the week, but how long that relationship has been going and how they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to keep it quiet all this time?</description>

The loyal audience of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; appears to be split 50-50 between approving this past season&amp;rsquo;s developing Gil Grissom-Sara Sidle romantic relationship, while the other half wants the show to focus on the forensic cases, said Jorja Fox, who plays Sara.
Since &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has focused so much on the procedural elements, &amp;ldquo;there are so many interesting stories we could still show&amp;rdquo; on the emotional side.
Fox has been with the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; since its second episode, but notes the Grissom-Sidle romance has been in the work for the past six seasons.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a headless corpse and the near-death of a colleague to get you in the mood for romance. At least this week that is how it seems in this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of US drama CSI.
In the final episode of the sixth series, Grissom is relaxing in his bedroom, when who should emerge from his bathroom wearing nothing except a silky robe and a warm smile but his colleague Sara Sidle!</description>

      <description>Move over, Madison. New names take hold.
The names of Saskatchewan babies suggest 2005 was a good year for the TV show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
While data from the province&amp;rsquo;s vital statistics bureau shows Madison, Emma, Emily and Olivia topped the list of Saskatchewan baby girl names last year, the oddly spelled Jorja made its appearance on the list at No. 30.
Twenty-four baby girls share their name with Jorja Fox, the sleuthing brunette actress who plays Sara Sidle on the popular forensics show.</description>

      <description>Question: Hey, Matt! I love your column and just wanted to say, as a sci-fi fan, I appreciate all the attention you give to those great yet underappreciated shows. Now to my question. What are your thoughts on TV&amp;rsquo;s growing trend of hooking up every character on a show with each other? I&amp;rsquo;ll use CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as an example because of the fuss the season finale created. The show was great because it focused on the stories and not the characters.</description>

      <description>CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION stars MARG HELGENBERGER and JORJA FOX will be showing off their singing skills as a duo at an upcoming charity concert. The actresses are reportedly working on a rendition of BEN E KING&amp;rsquo;s STAND BY ME for the fourth annual What A Pair benefit, which raises cash for breast cancer charities. Helgenberger, whose mother is a breast cancer survivor, is a longtime supporter of the event which, this year, will also feature the vocal talents of actresses JESSICA BIEL, LEA THOMPSON and JOELY FISHER.</description>

**Sara and Grissom have been having an affair for a long time on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;: ** See, I thought Brass&amp;rsquo; near death experience was a wake up call to Grissom but many of you think those two star-crossed lovers have been having an affair for awhile. They&amp;rsquo;ve just been keeping it from us (kind of like how we didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Sam and Jack on &amp;ldquo;Without a Trace&amp;rdquo;). I like this idea.</description>

      <description>One Final Question - Jorja Fox
What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be upstaged by strange fibers and fluids?
*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* is the top-rated drama in the US, but there are two spin-offs now. Does it annoy you that CSI: Miami and now CSI: NY are sponging off your ratings?
Well, they say it&amp;rsquo;s a great form of flattery, right? I think in the beginning we were all quite afraid. Our show in the States had barely got on its legs and already we were going to have competition from the inside.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s been working in some of the best shows on US TV for a full decade - ER and The West Wing among them. But it&amp;rsquo;s CSI which has made her a household name. We spoke to the actress on set of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular show.
How is Season Six coming along?
It&amp;rsquo;s flying by - it&amp;rsquo;s almost over, which is weird, they go so fast now. The first couple of years you feel like three years of your life have passed when you finish a season, and now we blink and we&amp;rsquo;ve got five shows left or something.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox aka Sara Sidle:
SHOOTING STARS OCT. 13, 2005
It deals with a bunch of kids that end up in a cult, and a spaceship is supposed to come get them. I loved that it had a little bit of mysticism in it. One of the scenes involves this girl who ends up in this abandoned barn. All of a sudden, the whole place starts to turn into white light and the barn starts to shake.</description>

      <description>In CSI she&amp;rsquo;s the ice cool utterly dedicated slightly grungy Sara Sidle but in real life Jorja Fox, 37, is far warmer with a passion for Blighty and in particular London. Revealing her anglophile leanings, she tells TV plus &amp;ldquo;I love London, it&amp;rsquo;s great I&amp;rsquo;m loving the walking thing and the street energy of London the diversity and most of the people are really educated, cool and hip.
CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox is passionate about Britain and in particular the beer.</description>

What does it mean to star Jorja Fox, 37, who plays Sara Sidle?
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea&amp;rdquo; she gasps. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing we play in all but four countries in the planet and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to process that. I just go about my life and sometimes people say hello, and that&amp;rsquo;s a really nice feeling.</description>

CSI
(CBS)
Rating: * * *
The finale word: Last year, CSI broke out of its normal pattern for a two-part finale that buried Nick alive. This year&amp;rsquo;s solid finale stuck closer to the show&amp;rsquo;s extremely popular formula - and yet it seemed to send many fans into a frenzy.
The fuss was not over the fate of a critically wounded Capt. Brass, perhaps because no one really thought his fate was in doubt.</description>

      <description>That sound you heard at 9 p.m. on May 18 was collective gasping from millions of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans as they watched an intimate scene from the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale, in which Gil Grissom (William Petersen) chatted casually with co-worker Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) &amp;#8212; in a bedroom.
The two investigators are in a relationship, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms. And it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;not so new.&amp;rdquo;
She says the show&amp;rsquo;s many law-enforcement contacts say that those who work in the crime field are often attracted to each other, due to shared experiences and interests.</description>

      <description>One of the stars of the US&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama CSI speaks out&amp;hellip;
AS SARA SIDLE, one of the crack forensics experts in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox gets to wade through human body parts to solve murders. The show has two spin-off series, and is set to return for its seventh year in the US in September.
Did you think the show would become such a huge hit?

      <description>For a season finale, the series leaves viewers on a sour note and cranks up the cheese more than usual
You expect a certain amount of cheese when you watch CSI, but the season finale &amp;ldquo;Way To Go,&amp;rdquo; was much worse than usual. There were a number of lines, which I like to call groaners, that were added to get a laugh, but instead caused me to audibly groan to ease the pain inflicted by terrible writing.</description>

After the surgery, Brass pulls through. Everyone is happy. It&amp;rsquo;s how the episode ended that left me asking questions. Grissom was lying in bed talking about how he&amp;rsquo;d like to die. He wants cancer so he has time to plan out and enjoy his last few months. At first I thought he was talking to himself&amp;hellip; which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put past Gil. But then Sara walked out of the bathroom wearing a white silk bathrobe!</description>

      <description>Modest to a fault, Jorja Fox is gracious about what many would call the burden of fame and relentless scrutiny by the public that comes when starring on TV&amp;rsquo;s top rated show. CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;In general, I&amp;rsquo;m only surprised that people want to hear what I have to say at all, about anything,&amp;rdquo; she laughs. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m always, you want to interview me? OK. Sure!&amp;rdquo;
But Fox doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about her fabulous television career, doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to pose for the cameras in yet another glamorous photo shoot.</description>

      <description>CSI Colleagues Aren&amp;rsquo;t Just Pals
For years, fans of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; have been wondering: Is there more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye?&amp;rdquo; In the May 17 episode, we found out that the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
But now we have even more questions . and, as it turns out, so do the show&amp;rsquo;s stars. *The Early Show* co-anchor Julie Chen talked to the cast of the CBS primetime drama about their characters&amp;rsquo; futures.</description>

Now we have even more questions, and so do the CSI stars. Last night&amp;rsquo;s episode was almost over when we heard Gil Grissom ruminating about the end of his own life.
William Petersen: And it&amp;rsquo;s a little scene, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a coda to the end of the season.</description>

      <description>Oh snap! &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; better watch out. It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale (warning, don&amp;rsquo;t read this if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-ender yet):
I got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: &amp;ldquo;The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a &amp;#8216;Bizarro World CSI,&amp;rsquo; as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death.</description>

His blood pressure is dangerously low and Brass flatlines on the table. The doctors bring him back, and Brass hallucinates, remembering when he asked Grissom to be his emergency contact and to have power of attorney in case something happens, because there&amp;rsquo;s no one he trusts more with his life or death.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] :Jorja Fox: It&amp;rsquo;s almost like we have these alter egos, y&amp;rsquo;know, and uh, and that started back in season one and now that it&amp;rsquo;s been six years, I totally do, I have hopes for her, and dreams for her, and I get upset for her- :Julie Chen: You&amp;rsquo;re more showier than her.  :Jorja Fox: -yeah, yeah, no it&amp;rsquo;s confusing sometimes. And ah, certain times of the year I&amp;rsquo;ll buy a piece of wardrobe and I&amp;rsquo;ll look at it in the summer and I&amp;rsquo;ll be like &amp;lsquo;Who bought that?</description>

      <description>Several Of The Actors Reflect On What Makes Them Tick

Question: Things I noticed looking at the CSI picture: Nick has a cut on his neck, the dead body has a police badge in its pocket, and the bench says &amp;ldquo;GG + ?&amp;rdquo;. Am I on to anything? &amp;#8212; Jaime
Ausiello: Not sure what the cut on Nick&amp;rsquo;s neck means, but the badge is definitely a big clue and, based on the hints Jorja Fox dropped in last week&amp;rsquo;s AA, I&amp;rsquo;m betting the &amp;ldquo;GG + ?</description>

      <description>Trading forensic evidence in for a kickball craze
&amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda have an interesting way of unwinding after a long day on the set &amp;#8212; engaging in a good ole&amp;rsquo; game of kickball. Fox and Szmanda are members of the World Adult Kickball Association, playing for the Royal Blue Balls team. The pair played during a semifinal game last night at a field in North Hollywood, and TMZ was there to capture it.</description>

      <description>Will CSI Have a Cow Over Fox Spot?
Prime-time sleuth Jorja Fox is keeping a pretty meaty secret from her bosses at CSI: She recently posed for a pro-vegetarian ad for animal rights group PETA. No big deal, except the ad-which will be unveiled May 11 in LA-relies heavily on her CSI connection. Perhaps too heavily. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask for permission, which I probably should have,&amp;rdquo; confesses Fox, a longtime vegetarian.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit TV show CSI, manages to make dusting for fingerprints, collecting DNA, and examining cadavers look like the hottest job around. Now, Fox hopes to generate the same amount of buzz for vegetarianism as she has for forensic science. In her new ad for PETA, Fox encourages people to &amp;ldquo;investigate vegetarianism&amp;rdquo;-something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing for 20 years.
&amp;ldquo;[I]f you just cut down [on meat] or tried [vegetarianism], you might find that you love it,&amp;rdquo; Fox says in her exclusive interview with PETA.</description>

Question: Some CSI forums are saying you&amp;rsquo;re completely full of it because you said you were 99 percent sure there would be no Grissom-Sara stuff in the season finale.

Your reputation is on the line here! &amp;#8212; Jamie&amp;lt; Ausiello: I&amp;rsquo;ve read those spoilers, too, and all I can say is thank god I didn&amp;rsquo;t say I was 100 percent certain.</description>

      <description>Synopsis In a twist to the normal CSI format, this episode was told from two perspectives: that of the CSIs and that of the killers.

Karl shoots and kills Clayton in retribution, after Nash contacts him as a part of the 12-step process to cure one&amp;rsquo;s self of dependency.</description>

      <description>Whether she plays doctor Maggie Doyle on ER, or forensic investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, Jorja Fox always plays ambitious, smart and somehow a little standoffish women. &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t have any boyfriends, no friends and no sex&amp;rdquo;, she says, quasi-sadly. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve played with George Clooney, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing with Gary Dourdan (Warrick on CSI), who&amp;rsquo;s currently on the list with the most beautiful men, but kissing with them, no chance.</description>

Season 5 is perhaps the shows most successful year to date. It&amp;rsquo;s always been a ratings winner - ever since the &amp;ldquo;Pilot&amp;rdquo; - but it&amp;rsquo;s clear from watching the fifth series that the producers have grown supremely confident. The budget seems even higher than before, helping CSI to match (or, in some cases, exceed) your average crime movie. The formula has become routine, and audiences know exactly what to expect.</description>

J is for Jorja. Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, and co-star George Eads were sacked from the show over a pay dispute that delayed the start of filming on the fifth series. The pair had argued for a pay increase but were later re-hired on the old salary - &amp;pound;50,000 per episode.

      <description>Jorja Fox has seen her character Sara Sidle go through a lot over the five and a half years &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; has been on the air, but the 6th season has been less tumultuous for Sara, even allowing her to help Nick Stokes (George Eads) as he grapples with the fallout from his ordeal in Grave Danger. Fox took the time to sit down with CSI Files to discuss the reunited CSI team, her complicated reactions to the team split in the previous season and Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationships with the other characters on the show.</description>

Catherine runs with the main case, of a woman, Christina Adalian, found dead in front of her baby, Joey, by her sister. While the scene appears to be a suicide, there&amp;rsquo;s no blood spatter on Christina&amp;rsquo;s hand. Another catch is that she&amp;rsquo;s still a virgin and had the baby via Cesarean. Doc Robbins initially suspects frottage, but Sara digs up news that Christina was affiliated with Project Sunflower.</description>

Next month, Grissom and Sofia (new series regular Louise Lombard) will share a heart-to-heart in his office, when Sara walks in and thinks she&amp;rsquo;s interrupting something more intimate.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a funny thing about our show, &amp;lsquo;cause I say that the audience is almost split down the middle, where about 50% of the audience really just wants to, they want the stories. They don&amp;rsquo;t wanna get into the characters personal lives all that much. And then the whole other 50% of the audience wants always to know more about the characters. It&amp;rsquo;s a unique conundrum for the writers, and I think they handle it very gracefully and &amp;hellip; they&amp;rsquo;re always disappointing someone and they&amp;rsquo;re always making someone happy.</description>

      <description>Synopsis## A husband and wife, unhappily married, have a night alone which ends when the wife is found dead at the bottom of the stairs in a pool of blood. The case unfolds ambiguously, as the evidence points to an accident or a murder, but neither conclusively. The husband, Ray, was married before and his first wife died of a stroke, falling on the stairs; this is later proven correct by exhumation and autopsy.</description>

[&amp;hellip;]
The crush rears its ugly head again: When Grissom and Sara were processing the upstairs of the Lesters&amp;rsquo; house, there was an awkward moment when Sara said, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to sleep in the same bed to have sex. Or to have romance.&amp;rdquo; Grissom couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get out of that room fast enough. Of course, this scene brings up another question I&amp;rsquo;ve had about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; forever: Why do these guys always use their flashlights instead of just turning on the lights?</description>

      <description>Synopsis Two cases are well tied together in this episode, aptly showing how, in the end, we all end up in the same place. The episode is filmed with a lot of split screen, allowing one case to mirror the other and to hi-light the class differences between the dead men. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that the CSI&amp;rsquo;s seem to treat each case as equally important.
One case is of Julian Harper, and up and coming actor who was found dead in his hotel room by his best friend, Blinky.</description>

      <description>What a difference a year (not to mention a coffin, a crazed killer and hundreds of fire ants) has made for CSI.
Last season was a rocky one, both behind and in front of the camera, whether it was one of the stars reportedly being fired and rehired after a contract spat or the show&amp;rsquo;s investigative team suddenly splintering into two squads. Then along came the sizzling season finale, which reunited the teams in order to save a kidnapped Nick (George Eads), who faced certain death trapped in an insect-filled casket.</description>

Jorja Fox I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vegetarian since I was nineteen.

Tele Star: Recent rumours indicated that you were no longer part of CSI. True or false?
Jorja Fox: Both! In fact, I was fired. But they called me back within a week.</description>

However, a more tangible problem that reality television has caused is a heavy increase in unemployment among actors and production crews. I was able to speak with two actresses, Jorja Fox of C.S.I. and Sami Reade an actress with 15 years of experience. They discussed how the changes have affected them and members of the acting and production community.
Jorja Fox explained how many actors, crew members, and writers have lost their jobs.</description>

      <description>She knows a swab from a cotton bud and a Glock from a&amp;hellip; er&amp;hellip; glockenspeil. Jorja Fox looks at the career of CSI Sara Sidle
JORJA FOX took a huge gamble when she left the critically acclaimed West Wing to try out for the CSI pilot. Although she was fascinated by the script, the talented actress was convinced the fledgling series would get cancelled after only eight episodes. Fortunately, Fox&amp;rsquo;s prediction was wrong, but looking back she wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure she had nailed the role of crime investigator Sara Sidle.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Petersen and several of the members of his cast, such as Marg Helgenberger and Gary Dourdan, have been openly critical of the two CSI spinoffs, saying they dilute the brand. Matters got worse when two of the original CSI actors, Jorja Fox and George Eads, were fired (and then rehired) by CBS boss Les Moonves for making excessive wage demands. Hostility heightened between the show&amp;rsquo;s financiers (CBS and Toronto-based co-producer Alliance Atlantis) and its cast, half of whom got raises while the remainder did not, leaving more than a few bruised egos.</description>

Question: I keep hearing rumors about a CSI episode taking place in London. Any truth? - Shelly
Ausiello: Yes and no. It was planned originally for November sweeps, but then all the cast upheaval squeezed the schedule and made it impossible. So, not only did George and Jorja screw themselves out of a raise, but their antics cost them - and their costars - a free trip across the pond as well.</description>

Petersen&amp;rsquo;s shortened workday is evident in tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode, &amp;ldquo;Nesting Dolls,&amp;rdquo; which intertwines domestic abuse with mail-order brides. However, his scenes are significant, marking one of the rare occasions in which CSI goes home with a character to peel back layers of personality.
In the episode, Grissom visits the apartment of suspended subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) to ask why the abuse case triggered an outburst that endangered her job.</description>

She played Lana, a Las Vegas stripper who served her jury duty with a heapin&amp;rsquo; helping of sass on the side. In fact, Ms. Buxton&amp;rsquo;s resum&amp;amp;e reads like a laundry list of shady-lady roles &amp;#8212; go-go girls, hookers, home-wreckers and other miscellaneous temptresses &amp;#8212; in films, prime-time TV and daytime soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of our Lives.</description>

      <description>LOS ANGELES (Zap2it.com) It looks like we can finally close the book on the past week of &amp;ldquo;As &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; Turns.&amp;rdquo;
CBS and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star George Eads reached an agreement Friday (July 23) that will allow Eads back on the series, a little more than a week after he was fired in a contract dispute.
So, despite much back-and-forth talk about contracts and oversleeping and the like, it turns out television&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated drama series will begin its fifth season with cast intact.</description>

      <description>Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, says a &amp;ldquo;misunderstanding&amp;rdquo; caused her not to show up for work last week.
According to published reports, Fox was axed after she failed to meet a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, that she would continue to report for work despite whatever contractual issues she might have.
Fox was said to be &amp;ldquo;mystified&amp;rdquo; because she believed she&amp;rsquo;d mailed her &amp;ldquo;pledge&amp;rdquo; letter in on time.
&amp;ldquo;E! News Live&amp;rdquo; was the first to update the Fox situation when it reported that she will definitely return to the show.</description>

      <description>LOS ANGELES (Zap2it.com) &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; will resume production next week with, at most, one fewer regular than in past seasons.
Television&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama brought Jorja Fox back to its cast Thursday (July 22), the AP reports. George Eads, the other cast member who was dumped late last week in an apparent salary dispute, remained out of a job.
Fox&amp;rsquo;s rehiring ends, at least for her, a well-documented week in which she was booted from the show in an apparent salary dispute.</description>

      <description>George Eads and Jorja Fox have been sacked from C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation for breach of contract.
The pair were sacked after they failed to show up for work on Thursday (15th), the first day of production on the crime drama&amp;rsquo;s fifth season.
According to reports, the no-show was a deliberate tactic as part of an ongoing pay dispute with CBS.
The duo were seeking raises from their previous salary, estimated at $100,000 an episode.</description>

      <description>Can fired &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; actors get their jobs back? George Eads and Jorja Fox insist that they were fired over misunderstandings and weren&amp;rsquo;t holding out for more money by Gary Susman
George Eads appeared at the Television Critics Association&amp;rsquo;s summer conclave in Los Angeles on Wednesday to promote TNT&amp;rsquo;s July 30 movie &amp;ldquo;Evel Knievel,&amp;rdquo; in which he stars as the famed daredevil, but Eads&amp;rsquo; biggest hurdle these days is getting his job back as detective Nick Stokes on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</description>

      <description>Although there&amp;rsquo;s no official confirmation from CBS, sources confirm that fired CSI actress Jorja Fox has been given her job back - but at her old $100,000-per-episode salary. (Poor thing.) &amp;ldquo;There will be no renegotiation,&amp;rdquo; says a source close to the show. Ditto Fox&amp;rsquo;s co-star George Eades, who apparently did just enough groveling at the TCA press tour on Wednesday. &amp;ldquo;Let me tell you, I&amp;rsquo;ve apologized nine ways to Sunday,&amp;rdquo; he told reporters.</description>

      <description>CBS has rehired &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox and is talking to George Eads about a reprieve as well.
Fox will be back on the set of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; when the show resumes production next week, insiders said. The actress was axed last week when CBS execs believed she had failed to comply with a request to sign a letter stating she had no plans to skip work while she and several other thesps sought raises.</description>

      <description>Both George Eads and Jorja Fox are expecting to still be part of the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation cast for the fifth season, stating their firings last week was one big misunderstanding. CBS reportedly let the two actors go for breach of contract. Reports said they had asked for more money to stay on the show.
Eads, who played Nick Stokes on the popular show, tells the Associated Press that the reason he didn&amp;rsquo;t show up on-time the first day of filming was because he overslept.</description>

Jorja Fox, axed last week from TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama, will return to the scene of the crime and rejoin the show, sources tell E! News Live.
Fellow fired costar George Eads will stage a similar comeback-or so he hopes. Speaking to TV critics in Los Angeles Wednesday, Eads called his dismissal &amp;ldquo;a big misunderstanding,&amp;rdquo; the Associated Press reported.

Everybody really does love &amp;ldquo;Raymond.&amp;rdquo;
The firing of two &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; stars in a salary dispute was fair and intended to help the TV industry draw the fiscal line, CBS chief Les Moonves said Sunday.
Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes on the hit CBS crime drama, were dumped last week when they failed to report for work on the upcoming season, he said.</description>

      <description>Walking off the set or halting production of a new season is nothing new to the television industry. It&amp;rsquo;s a right of passage, a game to play, in the struggle of actor contract negotiations. Just this year, the six principal voices of the Simpson&amp;rsquo;s characters halted production demanding an increase in salary from $125,000 per episode to $360,000.
[&amp;hellip;]
However last week, the balance of power shifted back to CBS and all the studios with the firing of actors George Eads and Jorja Fox who play play investigators Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle on the hit CBS crime drama CSI, as Les Moonves, CBS chief, called the duo&amp;rsquo;s bluff.</description>

      <description>ACTOR Jorja Fox has been sacked from the hit TV drama CSI just a day before filming was due to begin on a new series.
It is thought she was fired after a dispute over her pay.
Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the drama, was five years into a seven-year contract with the CBS network. CSI is regularly Australia&amp;rsquo;s most watched TV show.
Fox, 36, previously starred in ER as Dr Maggie Doyle and in a season of The West Wing as Gina Toscano.</description>

Two popular regulars, George Eads and Jorja Fox, prominent since the beginning, were dismissed when they sought salary increases and declined to report for work.
The man who said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re fired,&amp;rdquo; Leslie Moonves, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Viacom, CBS&amp;rsquo; parent, was blunt Sunday.
&amp;ldquo;We feel it&amp;rsquo;s very important that it&amp;rsquo;s time people realize that a contract is a contract,&amp;rdquo; he said.</description>

Jorja Fox and George Eads, two of the stars of CBS&amp;rsquo;s hyper-literate police drama, have been fired for breach of contract. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the actors had been in a dispute over their salaries.
We find CBS&amp;rsquo;s move particularly lame, not only because we find Fox to be charming (she&amp;rsquo;s got an exquisitely complex face whose slightest gesture tells a whole story), but also because her character, Sara Sidle, has had some serious chemistry with head CSI dude Gil Grissom (William L.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox once starred as a rooster in the children&amp;rsquo;s classics Chicken Little.

The rooster role, she says, will never be reprised. &amp;ldquo;I dropped out of the play, actually,&amp;rdquo; a giggling Fox told TV Guide in Los Angeles.</description>

From copssister: Have you been able to scrape up info on Without a Trace. It&amp;rsquo;s so good, it made me tape ER and watch it!
I hear there are office romances on Without a Trace, CSI and CSI: Miami this year.</description>

Question:
I enjoy your column, but I had to throw my two cents in on the
CSI romance issue. I think you were hasty in saying that a pairing
would be disastrous. The show already deals with a tremendous amount of
non-case driven material &amp;mdash; just look at how Catherine Willows is
portrayed: single mother (as is mentioned almost every episode), former
stripper, has a murdered, violent ex-husband, her possible father may be a</description>

      <description>Question: Okay, what is up with CSI? In the beginning it was no romance,
strictly science. Well now, all the hype is that Gil and Sara are going to
fall in love, or whatever they&amp;rsquo;re saying. I mean, what about the finale?
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they have Gil tell Sara about his surgery, if the master plan is
to have them together? Why would he tell Catherine if really he wants to be</description>

      <description>ONE question romantically inclined TV audiences never tire of asking is &amp;ldquo;Will they or won&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;
These days, the most unlikely TV couple who&amp;rsquo;s keeping them guessing is &amp;ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation &amp;ldquo; &amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle and her boss, Gil Grissom, played by Jorja Fox and William Petersen.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the series&amp;rsquo; parade of autopsies rather than its more subtle relationship dynamics, you missed one of last season&amp;rsquo;s most heartbreaking below-the-radar attempts at pairing off.</description>

&amp;ldquo;They have an expression that&amp;rsquo;s so popular among the producers, writers and cast of CSI that they made it the title of a two part episode that will open the show&amp;rsquo;s next season: Assume nothing.
Mainly it concerns the scientific unravelling of the most minute clues left in the wake of murders, when the CSI team moves in with its hi-tech equipment. But if you want to know about something that appears to be far more simple, say a personal relationship between the CSI team&amp;rsquo;s aloof boss, Gil Grissom and TV&amp;rsquo;s sexiest scientist Sara Sidle you can apply the same rule.</description>

      <description>The scene: the Utah desert, 35 miles from Salt Lake City. Tons of nuclear waste could soon be rumbling toward the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, whose band of Goshutes is already beset by nearby nerve-gas storage and hazardous-waste incinerators. Enter James Cromwell, who played the U.S. president in the nuclear-weapons thriller The Sum of All Fears. In 2002, the actor addressed senators in Utah and traveled to Washington, D.C., to fight a proposed storage facility for 44,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste on Goshute land.</description>

It really started, uh, I would say, in January, about midway through the season. Ah, the first thing that happens is, is, a very good friend of hers betrays her very personally. And the next time we see Sara, her boyfriend, it turns out, has a girlfriend and he also betrays her.</description>

What prompted this sudden change?

The resume was modest. She had taken modeling classes as a kid, done a little drama work in high school, and she&amp;rsquo;d had a couple of brief glimpses of gore as an emergency-room volunteer.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has always been stingy with details about the private lives of its workaholic characters, and they, in turn, don&amp;rsquo;t know much about one another. But this &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t ask, don&amp;rsquo;t tell&amp;rdquo; policy is about to backfire on forensics chief Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen). His crime lab will blow up in the May 8 episode, triggering revalations &amp;ldquo;that are bigger than the explosion itself,&amp;rdquo; says Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer of the CBS hit.</description>

And that&amp;rsquo;s amazing, I think- You know, the other reason that I thought the show was going to flop was because it was about science. And I thought that was going to be a very hard thing to make to look fascinating and interesting and exciting to people.

Would you enjoy a real-life career in criminology?
I have no desire to do this job! I have a tremendous amount of respect and regard for the people that do. I feel lucky to have gotten to know a couple of people who are criminalists, and have the best idea that I can of what they do. It is very brave and very dark and very intense and very driven.</description>

      <description>Gruesome but gripping &amp;#8212; that&amp;rsquo;s CSI, the US crime series that&amp;rsquo;s gained quiet a reputation
If you were asked to name the most successful American TV show, you&amp;rsquo;d probably think of Friends, ER, The Sopranos, or Sex and the City. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s none of those &amp;#8212; it&amp;rsquo;s actually CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which has taken America by storm and is winning plenty of fans here too.
Returning for a third season this week, it&amp;rsquo;s a crime drama with a difference &amp;#8212; with forensic science being the star of the show, rather than the actors.</description>

      <description>Are you surprised at the popularity of the show and the amount of young people who are going to college now to learn more about forensics?
JORJA FOX: I&amp;rsquo;m enormously surprised at the success of ?C.S.I.? I think that even in all of our wildest dreams that we could have imagined as great a run as we are having and I&amp;rsquo;m just thrilled about it. I feel blessed every day. I&amp;rsquo;m also surprised that, yes, there seems to be an increase in kids wanting to study forensics.</description>

      <description>Synopsis## The strange worlds of magic and rock music are explored in this creepy episode. Grissom investigates when a woman vanishes while taking part in a magician&amp;rsquo;s act. The female volunteer is placed inside the Amazing Zephyr&amp;rsquo;s Chamber of Doom and the illusionist thrusts swords through the box. When it&amp;rsquo;s opened, she&amp;rsquo;s gone&amp;ndash;and doesn&amp;rsquo;t reappear in her seat as she&amp;rsquo;s supposed to. Only traces of blood are left inside the chamber.</description>

      <description>A permanent disappearance during a magic trick means it&amp;rsquo;s time to call in the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; crew. Inhuman blood droplets and the discovery of a razor sharp knife just magnify the mystery for investigators. And as star JORJA FOX told ET, tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode on CBS is so realistic that it frightened her. Meanwhile, over at &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; sister show, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami,&amp;rdquo; a decision has been made regarding an episode that features a sniper.</description>

Question: I am a huge CSI fan. I was wondering if you have heard anything about if the show is going to put Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) together? You can see that they&amp;rsquo;re attracted to each other! Do you think that Grissom and Sara should date despite their age difference? ? Karen
Matt: I think dating would be a huge mistake for CSI, but not because I&amp;rsquo;m an ageist or anything.</description>

I know the big thing about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.) is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the personal life of the characters, but I do love the subtle tension that is building between Grissom and Sara. He&amp;rsquo;s obviously fighting his attraction to her and she&amp;rsquo;s obviously angry about his announcement that she needs to get a life. The really amazing thing is how much more vibrant and interesting the characters on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; are versus the characters on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami.</description>

      <description>As crime-solving wizards on TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama, the stars of CSI steep themselves in blood, bullet holes and (very) gross anatomy.
This past summer the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation did what you&amp;rsquo;d expect anyone from a major hit series to do. They kicked back and forgot about the inanimate parade of bruised, gouged, mutilated and (on one memorable occasion) liquefied corpses that form the dramatic center of the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s high-tech forensic sleuthing.</description>

Her latest fitness foray: adding tennis to her repertoire, which already includes running, boogie boarding and hiking.

That she would ever be standing next to dead bodies that aren&amp;rsquo;t even cold yet, for a living, surprises Jorja more than anyone. The thirty-three year old actress slowly but surely made her way up to Hollywood.</description>

They call her the lucky charm. First, Jorja Fox was gun-toting intern Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER. Then she was Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano, who protected the president&amp;rsquo;s daughter on The West Wing. When both of those story lines ended, Fox went on to play forensic-science hotshot Sara Sidle on CBS&amp;rsquo;s smash hit CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (Thursdays, 9 P.</description>

READ THIS BACKWARDS AND IT&amp;rsquo;LL MAKE MORE SENSE:
Jorja had a role in the indie-film sensation Memento.
OUR WEIRD-RADAR WAS IMPOUNDED:
&amp;ldquo;I might have that weird-radar, because the people who talk to me are almost never creepy. You&amp;rsquo;ve gotta wonder what kind of vibe you&amp;rsquo;re putting out there if you&amp;rsquo;re having really creepy people come talk to you.</description>

      <description>We go &amp;ldquo;undercover&amp;rdquo; with C.S.I&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox. By which we mean we dress her in crazy getups and ask her silly questions. It&amp;rsquo;s our m.o.!
Silver Lake, California, 3:19 on a sunny afternoon at the dog park, about a softball pitch away from downtown L.A.: I was scheduled to meet Jorja Fox at 3 P.M. and follow her around with a tape recorder while she walked her dogs. Just when I start to think, This sucks, I see a sprightly, tank-topped, ponytailed woman come bounding through the gates.</description>

      <description>Synopsis Season Finale. The CSIs investigate when the body of an unidentified young woman is discovered stuffed in an overturned shopping cart near a freeway underpass. Her horribly disfigured and partially decomposed face is a nightmare of blood, scabs and scars, as if she&amp;rsquo;d been shoved into a fan. A huge circular hole dominates her left cheek. Someone not only wanted her dead, Grissom reasons, but &amp;lsquo;they wanted her ugly.</description>

      <description>Bryant Gumbel: Although it now may seem hard to believe, it was just two years ago the hit drama &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; barely made it on to the primetime schedule. The show has since become a hit with an unusual look at forensic investigators who solve crimes with science.
[&amp;hellip;]
Bryant Gumbel The stars of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; are William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, Jorja Fox and Paul Guilfoyle. Good morning, everybody.

A bus carrying 23 passengers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas crashes less than 40 miles from its destination, killing nine people. Before he dies, the driver recalls that, moments before the wreck, the steering wheel began vibrating like a jackhammer in his hands, making it impossible for him to control the speeding vehicle. When the bus finally did come to a stop, it was on its right side on top of a sports car that was following it.</description>

The culprit is someone less obvious, though and with the murder weapon is left in plain sight begging the question: is the killer an insider?</description>

The latest slaying matches Millander&amp;rsquo;s previous killings in that it recreates his father&amp;rsquo;s murder, which Millander witnessed as a boy. In each case, the victim is shot once through the chest while lying in a bathtub. A nearby tape recorder contains the person&amp;rsquo;s supposed suicide message.
All three victims share the same birthday of Aug. 17&amp;ndash;the date Millander&amp;rsquo;s father was slain&amp;ndash;with the years in descending order from 1959.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen an episode of CSI, perhaps someone pointed out the face of Jorja Fox. Remember in 1996 when Maggie Doyle made her debut in Cook County in ER. It is with this role that she allured the public by accuratly protraying an intern who, after a fashion, tried to make her place among the doctors and befriended Carter (Noah Wyle), before acknowledging her homosexuality. In real life, Jorja is truly passionate, her talents touching everything she does : playing the guitar, singing, writing plays and working with a group with which she co-founded (Honey Pot Productions).</description>

      <description>Fox heads the network war and forces CBS ratings to exploit all grounds. No stranger to television &amp;#8212; this brunette meets more than just the average eye.
Thursday TV is the talk of two networks: one that hopes it&amp;rsquo;s still on the way up, and one that&amp;rsquo;s trying to halt its slide down. For nearly two decades, NBC dominated Thursday nights with its &amp;ldquo;Must See TV&amp;rdquo; lineup &amp;#8212; until last year, when CBS&amp;rsquo; combination of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Survivor&amp;rdquo; put the night in play.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox is out for truth, justice and a steady job
This week, Jorja Fox returns for a second season of the CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as determined detective Sara Sidle. This is big news- her previous characters have had a habit of disappearing from top-rated shows.
Five years ago, on ER, Fox played Maggie Doyle, the lesbian pediatrician who pissed off nurses and colleagues, then wandered off the series when the writers couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything more for her to do.</description>

But while the natures of her shows have been diverse, the characters she&amp;rsquo;s played have all had at least one thing in common: they are strong, independent women. On ER, Fox played cranky medical intern Maggie Doyle, on The West Wing she played the recurring role of Secret Service agent Gina Toscano.</description>

      <description>HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - It was difficult to conduct interviews with director Allison Anders and stars Kim Dickens and Gabriel Mann Thursday during Showtime&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Things Behind the Sun&amp;rdquo; premiere after-party at the Paramount Theater.
Tearful guests could not stop coming up to these three, professing love and gratitude; one fan literally bowed to kiss Dickens&amp;rsquo; foot.
This is the intense reaction a film about a 12-year-old&amp;rsquo;s gang rape will provoke in people.</description>

      <description>I never got off the bus
Who are your heroes?
I actually have a lot. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., John Lennon, Oprah Winfrey, Geronimo, Harvey Milk, Maya Angelou, Einstein. All share courage, independent thinking, immense creativity and a passion/compulsion for freedom and equality for all people. Geronimo, the only non-pacifist in the group, never gave up, faced unbeatable odds and persevered with ingenious strategy.
Is there a book or movie that has changed your life?</description>

Online extra: Q&amp;amp;A with actress Jorja Fox of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;
Jorja Fox, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; forensics investigator Sara Sidle, has a knack for landing in the hot show of the moment. Her face is familiar to viewers of both &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo;, on which she had recurring parts as a doctor and secret service agent respectively. Patty Rhule caught up with her on the final week of filming &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, the CBS hit with a remarkable debut season.</description>

      <description>Synopsis Grissom and his crew investigate when a young woman is strangled in her home, apparently the third victim of a serial killer. The crime scenes all have a common, mystifying element: this murderer really cleans them up, removing all traces of hair or fibers, and even plants misleading evidence. Just when things couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any worse, Grissom learns that the sheriff has called in the FBI to take over the investigation.</description>

Warrick tries to help a young inmate who witnessed the murder of a gang member.</description>

      <description>I know you&amp;rsquo;re a huge CSI fan.
I love CSI. Jorja Fox rules!
I&amp;rsquo;m glad to hear that. I enjoy the show, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; show. Because, to me, it&amp;rsquo;s finally the cop show that nerds have been waiting for.
I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s much more complex than that. I think Billy Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character is a great character. We&amp;rsquo;ve never had a character like that before on TV-a guy who is actually really a teacher, and is withdrawn in a way most guys on these shows aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Before she landed the role of scientist Sara Sidle on C.S.I., actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s life was literally going to the dogs.
What was your first job?
I worked at a kennel in New York City called the Montrose Pet Hotel. That was when I was 16, so I have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s still there or not.
What did you have to do?
I would feed the dogs, and I&amp;rsquo;d take them from their little hotels to these indoor dog runs.</description>

Catherine becomes convinced that a 6-year-old girl&amp;rsquo;s death was no accident when she and Sara examine a crime scene inside the Tunnel of Love ride at an amusement park.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja Fox (who can&amp;rsquo;t keep her mouth shut on TV&amp;rsquo;s CSI.) has the dialogue-free part of Shelby&amp;rsquo;s murdered wife. It seems like the wife ought to be the most important role. It seems also that this role was cast haphazardly, but maybe the problem is that Nolan didn&amp;rsquo;t create a more poignant sense of lost marital love.
When it goes Rashamonic and metaphysical at the disappointing end of the story, Memento gropes for a broader significance it doesn&amp;rsquo;t earn.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a line in Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, where Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential), as tormented lead character Leonard Shelby, is asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the last thing you remember?&amp;rdquo; He says, &amp;ldquo;My wife.&amp;rdquo; But the sum of what he can piece together from his injury-induced chronic loss of short-term memory is &amp;ldquo;the feel of a person.&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox, who suffers a Psycho-like death and haunts the film as Shelby&amp;rsquo;s memory of his murdered wife, does exactly that on the screen: creates the feel of a person.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox has appeared in a number of prominent television shows, including E.R., C.S.I. and West Wing. In Memento, she shows up as the victimized wife of Leonard Shelby - only seen in flashback sequences. For her, the experience of filming the film was almost like a dream because she only had to be on-set for a few days. &amp;ldquo;I filmed, I think, three days out of 29. So I had a very short, easy time,&amp;rdquo; she said.</description>

Then she moved to this year&amp;rsquo;s hottest new show, C.S.I., where she plays a criminologist. She must think this whole Hollywood thing is pretty damn easy.
I&amp;rsquo;ll bet Tally Briggs would kill to have Jorja&amp;rsquo;s luck&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox probably prefers not to describe her talents as &amp;ldquo;acting chops.&amp;rdquo; The dedicated vegetarian told The Sun&amp;rsquo;s Claire Bickley she even finds playing one of CSI&amp;rsquo;s forensic investigators a little too realistic.
THE SUN: Does the show&amp;rsquo;s grisly subject matter ever make you sick?
FOX: I think I&amp;rsquo;ve toughened up. My skin is a little bit tougher than when I started. That was my only concern when I started the show.</description>

      <description>The increasing presence of motion picture producers and directors in television is turning prime time into an unwatchable mess of PG-13 and even R-style mini-movies. Prominent names such as Joel Silver (The Matrix, Lethal Weapon) and Kevin Williamson (Scream) have already brought their big-screen values to small-screen series. Now add Jerry Bruckheimer (Coyote Ugly, The Rock) to the list. He serves as executive producer for CBS&amp;rsquo; grim CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the highest-rated new drama of the season and the only new show nominated for a Golden Globe &amp;ldquo;Best Series&amp;rdquo; Award.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox is on some kind of new career trajectory.
The actress moved from E.R., TV&amp;rsquo;s most popular series, to The West Wing, TV&amp;rsquo;s most critically acclaimed. She departed West Wing for C.S.I., the show that has turned out to be this season&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated new drama.
Is it even possible to improve on good fortune like that?
How about CBS moving CSI next week from Friday nights to Thursdays, where it will follow Survivor: The Australian Outback, almost guaranteeing it a spot in TV&amp;rsquo;s Top 10.</description>

      <description>ER fans know Jorja Fox as Dr. Maggie Doyle. West Wingers may remember her as Secret Service agent Gina Toscano, who saved the life of the president (Martin Sheen) last season. Currently, she&amp;rsquo;s co-starring in CBS&amp;rsquo;s surprise hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But even though she&amp;rsquo;s appeared on three of the hottest shows on television, Jorja Fox is not exactly a household name.
&amp;ldquo;I do like to keep a lower profile,&amp;rdquo; says Fox, 31, who plays forensic investigator Sara Sidel on CSI.</description>

Jorja Fox, who plays gung-ho investigator Sara Sidel, said writers are thinking about doing more to develop the characters, but she suspects that will happen slowly, over &amp;ldquo;a long haul.&amp;rdquo; In the meantime, &amp;ldquo;I love being mysterious,&amp;rdquo; she said.
The approach makes for some wonderful scenes. At the end of &amp;ldquo;If These Walls Could Talk,&amp;rdquo; Grissom is leaving the office after finishing the long, gruesome case. On the way out, he grabs an apple from the break room and notices a half-finished crossword puzzle on the table.</description>

      <description>Actor/executive producer William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and executive producer Carol Mendelsohn point out the reasons they brought Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) onto the show.
Why Jorja Fox? William Petersen: It was very interesting. Here was this young girl who was basically a rookie. And she comes out and we basically ignore her through out the night because we were too busy doing our stuff. And to have her get shot at the end of a pilot was somewhat profound.</description>

A bunch of healthy-looking, Anytown, USA-dwelling white people, whose tiny, tinny lives remain in the general orbit of a divorced mom named Delmar (played by ER&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox, who resembles a more robust Julianne Moore), occasionally convene over fabulous home-cooked meals to furrow their brows about nothing in particular.</description>

      <description>Synopsis The investigators work a trio of diverse cases that involve a murder, a theft and a disappearance in this intriguing episode. Grissom investigates the shooting death of a young woman when her bloodied and bug-infested body is found on a nearby mountain. Most of the circumstantial evidence points to the woman&amp;rsquo;s abusive husband as the likely killer. But Grissom&amp;rsquo;s not so sure, since his analysis of the bugs indicates that the victim was killed three days prior&amp;ndash;when the hubby was out of town.</description>

VALENCIA, Calif. &amp;#8212; Harsh sunlight burst through the ceiling of a burned-out house, turning the CSI criminalists into shadows against the charred walls. Smoke particles hung in the air, but, three months after an arson, the crime scene appeared cold.
&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left, Gris,&amp;rdquo; Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) said to his boss, Gil Grissom.
&amp;ldquo;More than you think,&amp;rdquo; the cerebral Grissom (William Petersen ) responded, already rooting out clues.</description>

      <description>Through its exploration of anal swabs and poisoned nipples, CSI: Crime Street Investigation - the CBS drama that has been described as Quincy meets Seven - has quickly become one of this season&amp;rsquo;s biggest hits. A large part of the show&amp;rsquo;s success can be chalked up to its stomach-churning shock value, an element that required its plucky cast - including actress Jorja Fox - to develop an extra layer of thick skin.</description>

While the staff awaits news regarding the injuries to Jed and Josh, they recall how Josh, Sam, and Toby became involved in the campaign three years earlier; Leo, Toby, and C.J. deal with inquiries on Secret Service protection policies, as well as the absence of executive authority while Jed was in surgery.

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s been shot?
It&amp;rsquo;s the question fans of NBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; have been asking all summer following the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale shooting attack on the president and his staff. Tonight viewers will get their answer.
NBC refused to send critics tapes of new episodes out of fear that some unthinking clod would lend the tape to his brother&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s cousin who might post revelations to a Web site, spoiling the surprise for everyone.</description>

      <description>C.S.I. (CBS, 9 p.m.): Weird, wild and witty. And in Vegas! You&amp;rsquo;d have to be strange to scrutinize crime there, so we have police crime scene investigators (as in the title) serving up chocolate-covered grasshoppers, synching &amp;ldquo;Dark Side of the Moon&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&amp;rdquo; and feeling &amp;ldquo;like King Kong on cocaine.&amp;rdquo; Their buzz comes from catching the baddies by &amp;ldquo;concentrating on what cannot lie: the evidence,&amp;rdquo; says sage boss William Petersen (&amp;ldquo;The Beast&amp;rdquo;), whose forensics team includes competitive hotshots Gary Dourdan and George Eads, single mom Marg Helgenberger and gung-ho newbie Jorja Fox.</description>

      <description>After the promise of the no-budget London thriller *Following, *all eyes were on what Nolan would do with a little Hollywood cash. And he certainly hasn&amp;rsquo;t taken the easy road. **Memento **is told with an even more unconventional narrative that keeps your brain in high gear from the very first shot. And it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely brilliant-a terrific little thriller that takes the genre and turns it inside out.
Leonard (Pearce) has a memory disorder: Ever since his wife (Fox) was raped and murdered, he can&amp;rsquo;t create new memories, so he must use a series of Polaroids, notes and tattoos to remind himself where he is, who the people around him are and what he should be doing as he seeks revenge.</description>

      <description>Scoop: In Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s February cover story, director Aaron Sorkin discussed his plans for this year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The West Wing.&amp;rdquo; The most dramatic change is in the cast, since Moira Kelly is leaving.
&amp;ldquo;Moira is a terrific actress,&amp;rdquo; Sorkin said. &amp;ldquo;But we just weren&amp;rsquo;t the right thing for her. She expressed that she felt the same way, and as a result, story lines haven&amp;rsquo;t been invested in that character, because we knew that at the end of the year, we&amp;rsquo;d be shaking hands and parting company.</description>

      <description>This is the new favorite show around the Nerdslut Electronic Hearth. Focusing on a group of Forensic Scientists and Technicians in Las Vegas, Nevada, you get to watch two or three different crimes get solved every episode. The science is primary &amp;#8212; and that&amp;rsquo;s what makes it so great. While occasional diversions are inserted into the scripts (e.g., Marge Heckelberger&amp;rsquo;s ex-husband, a gambling problem gone awry,) for the most part it&amp;rsquo;s good solid geek fun, and some mystery to boot.</description>

Starring: Suzanne Mara, Bill Nunn, David Shackelford, Paul Provenza, Peter Murnik, Katherine Kendall, Jorja Fox
(PG-13, 93 min.)
Commercially speaking, this ingratiating low-budget romantic comedy seems bound for one of two starkly opposed fates: Death on arrival or modest word-of-mouth success among fans who root for the underdog in all areas of life. (These willful contrarians are easily identified by their tendency to drink Mr. Pibb, use Atari computers, and communicate by CB radio.</description>

      <description>Mama&amp;rsquo;s Boys LLC presents a film directed by Gregory Ruzzin. Written by Fred Dresch and Ron Ratliff. Running time: 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for language). Opening today at Deerbrook, Lincoln Mall, Randhurst and Yorktown.
There are so many things wrong with &amp;ldquo;The Hungry Bachelors Club&amp;rdquo; that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to overlook some of the actors&amp;rsquo; fine work. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that they&amp;rsquo;re stuck portraying one-dimensional characters who make the &amp;ldquo;Melrose Place&amp;rdquo; crew appear deep.</description>

      <description>Offscreen bonds help the ensemble cast of The Hungry Bachelors Club bring a relaxed emotional honesty to their roles.
If you glimpsed the title The Hungry Bachelors Club on, say, a movie theater marquee, this romantic comedy might bring to mind a gaggle of frat boys chasing girls and chugging beer.
&amp;ldquo;I was afraid of that,&amp;rdquo; admitted director Gregory Ruzzin in an interview a week before his film&amp;rsquo;s opening.
But as Ruzzin and Club&amp;rsquo;s ensemble cast can tell you, once you get beneath the misleading title you&amp;rsquo;ll find a hometown story - about family, acceptance and new beginnings.</description>

This food-themed film, focusing on thirtysomethings at the helm of change, can be compared to Soul Food and Eat Drink Man Woman with a dash of Like Water for Chocolate. Single mother Delmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox) dreams of opening a restaurant called The Hungry Bachelors Club, so named for the weekly bachelor-littered dinner parties she throws. Without enough money, however, Delmar agrees to &amp;ldquo;loan an egg and rent a womb&amp;rdquo; to a couple willing to pay $50,000.</description>

      <description>PASADENA, CALIF. &amp;#8212; TV critics can be an unforgiving lot, but UPN&amp;rsquo;s fall schedule makes compassion tough to muster.
In an effort to draw more viewers &amp;#8212; particularly young, male viewers &amp;#8212; the struggling network has scheduled two hours of WWF wrestling Thursday night. Critics are bound to sneer, but it&amp;rsquo;s an easy move that&amp;rsquo;s likely to boost the network&amp;rsquo;s ratings.

UPN&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The True Story&amp;rdquo; (working title) stars Jorja Fox (intern Maggie Doyle on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;) as &amp;#8212; get this &amp;#8212; a medical intern whose father is in prison for killing her mother.
And, oh yes, intern Meghan has a brother who&amp;rsquo;s a cop.
&amp;ldquo;In one regard, this is a cavalcade of the work of Tom Fontana,&amp;rdquo; says the producer, who&amp;rsquo;s creating the new show with his longtime partner in crime, Barry Levinson.</description>

      <description>Jorja who? No one really knows who the hell she is, but she&amp;rsquo;s pretty hot, she&amp;rsquo;s on ER, and that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for UPN.
Jorja Fox, who plays intern Maggie Doyle on ER, is apparently doing her best David Caruso impersonation by leaving a hit show to take the lead role on the new UPN sure-fire bomb The True Story.
The show, from the creators of Homicide, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, will be ready for UPN&amp;rsquo;s fall schedule provided the two&amp;rsquo;s escape from Betty Ford goes off without a hitch.</description>

      <description>You are two hours from collision with an asteroid, and pirates have disabled your spaceship, seeking the forty billion dollars in cash thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s stuffed in your hold. This is Velocity Trap. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty standard mid-range action science fiction fare that benefits a lot from recent improvements in special effects technology.
When watching this film, you must first ask yourself what are you looking for and how are you judging it? If your primary interest in watching films is great acting and a stellar plot, you really ought not to look here first.</description>

Grim but Worthy &amp;#8212; Low-Life Study

What better place to set an earnest new miniseries aimed at teen viewers?
&amp;ldquo;Summer Stories: The Mall,&amp;rdquo; a three-part edition of the &amp;ldquo;ABC Afterschool Special,&amp;rdquo; premieres at 4 p.m. today (on Channel 13), with additional segments scheduled for the same time April 2 and 16 .</description>

In subsequent stories, Marla Clayton (Samaria Graham) will have to come to terms with her widowed mother&amp;rsquo;s pending remarriage, and Diane Dravecki (Jorjan Fox) will battle against slipping back into crack addiction.
Beneath the usual television gloss there&amp;rsquo;s a new grittiness, evident even in the casting, which clearly has tried to avoid stereotypically pretty new faces. Some of the actors, especially the intriguingly offbeat Ms. Fox, impressively convey the value of pure talent.</description>

      <description>In Racing Extinction, a team of artists and activists exposes the hidden world of extinction with never-before-seen images that will change the way we see the planet. Two worlds drive extinction across the globe, potentially resulting in the loss of half of all species. The international wildlife trade creates bogus markets at the expense of creatures that have survived on this planet for millions of years. And the other surrounds us, hiding in plain sight — a world that the oil and gas companies don’t want the rest of us to see.</description>

      <description>The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formed when Captain Paul Watson founded the Earth Force Society in 1977 in Vancouver BC, Canada. The original mandate of both organizations was marine mammal protection and conservation with an immediate goal of shutting down illegal whaling and sealing operations, but Sea Shepherd later expanded its mission to include all marine wildlife. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formally incorporated in the United States in 1981 in the state of Oregon.</description>
