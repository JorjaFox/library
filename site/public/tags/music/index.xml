      <description>Jorja has always been interested in music, from attending events to performing. She often attends concerts, especially if her friends are performing, and has been to the Grammy&amp;rsquo;s once. She has also written and performed several songs for the cast and crew of CSI, which she sang at the &amp;lsquo;wrap&amp;rsquo; parties in 2003 and 2004.
A Dreamer&amp;rsquo;s Holiday Written by Kim Gannon and Mabel Wayne, the song was performed by Jorja Fox and Patti Welch in Food for the Heart.</description>
