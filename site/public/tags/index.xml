      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Test&amp;rdquo; was a TV Talk show/game show on which four celebrities are brought on to answer ten questions about a given topic, and are &amp;#8216;scored&amp;rsquo; based on their answers. On April 24th, 2001, Jorja Fox was a panelist and the test was The Friendship Test.
The Topic The Friendship Test
The Questions  A friend needs your sperm/egg. Do you donate?
  Yes, however Jorja feels she would be more willing (and it would be easier) if she was able to donate her sperm instead of her egg.</description>
