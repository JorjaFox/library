      <description>The Screen Actors Guild (aka SAG) is an American labor union representing over 120,000 film and television principal performers and background performers worldwide. According to SAG&amp;rsquo;s Mission Statement, the Guild seeks to: negotiate and enforce collective bargaining agreements that establish equitable levels of compensation, benefits, and working conditions for its performers; collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members, and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances; and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members.</description>
