      <description>Julie Chen: If you can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of TV&amp;rsquo;s hottest drama, CSI:, then you&amp;rsquo;re in luck.

Jorja Fox: The camera comes in, you find a woman who&amp;rsquo;s obviously deceased, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s happened, there&amp;rsquo;s a pool of blood, and the only other sound in the house is of a baby crying.</description>

      <description>Premise The show follows the cases of the Crime Scene Investigation division of the Clark County (Nevada) Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Department, usually referred to by officers as the &amp;ldquo;Las Vegas Crime Lab.&amp;rdquo; The division solves crimes almost entirely through the means of forensics evidence, which may or may not come to the conclusion of a murder or accidental death. Keeping in theme with the setting, investigations often lead to taboo subjects, such as sexual deviations.</description>

While Doyle filed the report, the plot fell by the wayside, and Romano became the Chief of Emergency Medicine.</description>
