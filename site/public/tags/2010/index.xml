[&amp;hellip;]
And I&amp;rsquo;ve saved the best for last. Jorja Fox fans have emailed me in a fury about rumors that the lovely forensic scientist would only be on 11 episodes. But the CSI honchos were happy to report that while they&amp;rsquo;re still discussing exactly how many episodes she will appear in, fans can &amp;hellip;look for more than 11.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>If Marlee Matlin has her way, there will be more &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; dramas than just the three &amp;#8212; the original, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; and its spin-offs, (&amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;CSI: NY&amp;rdquo;) that CBS has on the air now.
Matlin guest-stars in an episode of the original &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; tentatively scheduled to air Thursday, Feb. 3. In &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms,&amp;rdquo; which has been in production this past week, Matlin plays Julia Holden, a professor at a college for the deaf, whose mentor is fellow professor Betty Grissom (Phyllis Frelich), mother of former head CSI Gil Grissom (William Petersen).</description>

      <description>The February 3rd episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; will have a pair of Grissoms facing off, but unfortunately, neither of them will be Gil Grissom, the role vacated a couple of years ago by William Petersen. Rather, it will be Grissom&amp;rsquo;s wife Sara (Jorja Fox) and his mother, who isn&amp;rsquo;t Fox had left the hit crime series the year before Petersen, but she returned for his final scene on the show, the couple closing things out with a big kiss.</description>

Ainav in Israel: I found a piece of information on the web that episode 11.13 of CSI is called &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms&amp;rdquo;! Now I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much for CSI anymore, but if that&amp;rsquo;s true then I care a whole lot!
It&amp;rsquo;s true! The Mrs. Grissoms in question are Sarah Sidle (the current Mrs. Grissom)&amp;hellip;and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s mom! Producers are casting now for the older Mrs. Grissom, who is described as a &amp;ldquo;strong, confident, intelligent and influential woman has never allowed her lack of hearing to keep her from doing anything she wanted, and has no trouble making her feelings known to one and all.</description>

      <description>Following an early season&amp;rsquo;s worth recent rocky episodes, &amp;ldquo;House of Hoarders&amp;rdquo; was a pleasant surprise.
After weeks of sharks in pools, vampires taking on werewolves, and a gimpy serial killers wearing pleather suits, I was almost certain the show&amp;rsquo;s handling of this psychological ailment of the moment would be serve as nothing but shock value.
But the writers took time to address the issue as a mystery and a very real problem.</description>

- &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; premiere thoughts: Man, where to freaking begin?Â Okay, first the good stuff. Larry Fishburne enters his third season on the show with some goddamn attitude, something his Dr. Raymond Langston character has been missing since he started in 2008, and it&amp;rsquo;s been great. Langston, still hurt from the prison attack that ended last season, walks around with a cane and a sneer, like he&amp;rsquo;s telling the world &amp;ldquo;I am through with you all fucking with me!</description>

In honor of this joyous holiday, I&amp;rsquo;m grilling up some tofu and paying respect to some of TV&amp;rsquo;s best vegetarians.</description>

      <description>Actress Jorja Fox may play a forensic scientist on CSI, but her real-life role is playing the part of mom to her 13-year-old boxer, Ali. &amp;ldquo;She was a rescue, and a friend of mine was desperately trying to find her a home,&amp;rdquo; Fox told PEOPLEPets.com last week at the Taste of Beverly Hills. After taking her in, &amp;ldquo;I had her only two or three weeks when I realized, &amp;#8216;This is probably the best decision I ever made.</description>

*CSI*&amp;#8216;s Jorja Fox says she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure to re-sign
Asked by the weekly French magazine Tele Star, Jorja Fox talked about the season 11 of CSI. She re-signed for 11 episodes and will see in early 2011 if she wants to do more. Making only a few episodes works for her.
She wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about returning to the show.</description>

Jorja Fox, 42, will return for the eleventh season as Sara Sidle. While CSI is ailing the United States, the actress puts things in the clear. Exclusively.
**Tele Star: After a thriller about your presence, then you will play in the season 11 Experts &amp;hellip; **
Jorja Fox: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m returning for eleven episodes. I&amp;rsquo;ll decide January if I want to continue.</description>

      <description>Late at night in San Francisco Airport; two transport trucks waiting; film and camera crews at the ready; ADI Ambassador Jorja Fox and the ADI Rescue Team on hand with supplies of water; one of the runways was about to play host to a contingent of lions flying in from Bolivia.
As the aircraft touched down, the level of excitement hit fever pitch: after months of negotiations, the four lions had finally made it: Camba, Simba, Bambek and Dactari were going to a new home.</description>

      <description>Some TV couples just have a certain spark. It makes them intriguing to watch as an audience, and their will-they-or-won&amp;rsquo;t-they plotlines and ups and downs create fan bases. Here is a list of the top ten TV couples.
[&amp;hellip;]
 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) &amp;ndash; CSI  This was handled in a different way. There were always hints that Sara and Grissom had a relationship prior to their time at CSI, and then it was suddenly revealed that they had been dating &amp;ndash; for years &amp;ndash; during the time period of the show.</description>

CSI show runner Carol Mendelsohn tells me Bill Irwin will be reprising his role as inmate Nathan Haskell in the show&amp;rsquo;s 11th season premiere, then return for three additional episodes in a story arc that will finally introduce the wife of Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s Dr. Raymond Langston. &amp;ldquo;Toward the end of the season, Mrs. Langston will play a pivotal role,&amp;rdquo; says Mendelsohn. Plus, hearing that Marg Helgenberger has decided to end her long run as Catherine Willows this season, Mendelsohn says she plans to &amp;ldquo;start begging on my knees as the season progresses.</description>

**Question: **Just read that Jorja Fox is returning as Sara Sidle on CSI, though it is not known yet whether she&amp;rsquo;d come back as a recurring star, as she has been since her initial &amp;ldquo;return,&amp;rdquo; or as a regular cast member. Though I was happy to read the news &amp;mdash; I think the show is better when Fox is on it &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;d be happy if she does a recurring role because then she&amp;rsquo;d still be Sara Sidle Grissom, but if it&amp;rsquo;s as a regular, I would think her tie with Gil would have to be eliminated, and I&amp;rsquo;ve rather liked the mentions because I still think the show lost a lot when Grissom (William Petersen) left.</description>

      <description>**Q. **I guess I missed an episode, because I have no idea why Sara (played by Jorja Fox) is back on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo; The last I saw, she quit and went to live in the jungle, followed shortly by Grissom. Later, she made a statement about her husband being in Paris. Could you please clear up this puzzle?
- Sandra Robson,
Port St. Lucie, Fla.
A. The CBS show wrote Sara out during season eight, and she bowed out by leaving Grissom (William Petersen) a letter explaining that she had to go away to deal with personal demons.</description>

      <description>Washington&amp;rsquo;s resident water lover, Philippe Cousteau (yes, he&amp;rsquo;s the grandson of that famous Cousteau) was exported to Hollywood on Thursday to teach actress Alyssa Milano and musician Jason Mraz a thing or two about the Gulf oil spill.
The District-based group, the Artists and Athletes Alliance, shipped Cousteau to Los Angeles so he could talk about the environmental effects at a private Hollywood briefing.
&amp;ldquo;Philippe offered his unique insight into the disaster and suggested ways for members of the entertainment community to assist with the recovery efforts,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Ross, executive director of the Artists and Athletes Alliance.</description>

At another Hollywood party, I recognised Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle in CSI. Buoyed by my earlier success with Liv Tyler, and fortified by several beers, I loitered with intent, waiting for the right time to introduce myself.
It is possible that I appeared to be a wild-eyed, leering madman. Apparently sensing that I was standing a little too close to be innocently passing by, Jorja stood up and, well &amp;hellip; ran away from me.</description>

      <description>This just in: Jorja Fox (Sara) has renewed her commitment to CSI.
Sources confirm to me exclusively that Fox has signed on to return for the procedural’s upcoming 11th season. Terms of her new contract are being kept under wraps, so it’s unclear whether she’ll be billed as a recurring guest star or a series regular.
CBS declined to comment.
Fox was one of five CSI vets negotiating new pacts with the show &amp;ndash; and the last to sign on the dotted line.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox addresses the press on the morning of the release of four ex-circus lions rescued by ADI from Bolivia
Jorja Fox: Good morning everyone. I just wanted to thank you so very, very, very, very much for all being here today. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that, as Pat already said, you&amp;rsquo;re in for something quite extraordinary. Very few people get to see something like this. It&amp;rsquo;s magical. It&amp;rsquo;s special. It&amp;rsquo;s a good day to be a compassionate person.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox: Oh my gosh! Look! Look! We&amp;rsquo;ve heard from Jan and, I guess, close to landing the cats woke up. They started to brush themselves off, and they already checked them when they arrived at the gate. They&amp;rsquo;re doing great, so we may get a look at them tonight.
[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja: Hi, Jan. So how many hours have you been awake?
Jan Creamer: I think about 20 hours. Something like that.</description>

      <description>Four lions, rescued by Animal Defenders International (ADI) from a Bolivian circus when the country banned the use of animals in circuses landed yesterday at San Francisco airport, before heading on to a life of luxury at the ARK 2000 sanctuary in Calaveras County.
ADI, which has previously rescued and relocated animals in Europe, South America and Africa have described it as one of the most complex logistical operation they have ever undertaken but say it will be worth all of the effort when the animals walk free.</description>

      <description>Although it has been a very, very, very long week, we have received news that the lions are finally on their way. They were boarded very early this morning in Bolivia, onto the back of a truck, where they headed off to the airport. The guys did really well, Camma was a little nervous but she settled down. When they arrived at the airport, the replacement aircraft had not shown up.</description>

      <description>Well! I&amp;rsquo;m here in San Francisco, working with the Animal Defenders International San Francisco team, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been on pins and needles waiting to get the go-ahead from Jan in Bolivia. I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten off the phone with her, and it looks like all systems are a go. Mel, the vet, has checked the crates and has checked the lions &amp;#8212; everyone&amp;rsquo;s doing well. I think that we&amp;rsquo;re going to start boarding in a few hours.</description>

Jorja Fox I know I am, I&amp;rsquo;m sure all of us are very concerned about everything that&amp;rsquo;s going on in the gulf.

On Thursday May, 27, 2010 at 3.30 p.m. PDT, four lions rescued from a Bolivian circus by Animal Defenders International (ADI) will be arriving at SFO before heading on to the ARK2000 sanctuary in Calaveras County where they will start a new life.
The animals are the first to be freed from circuses after Bolivia banned animal circuses &amp;ndash; a ban due to come into effect next month. For ADI, who have rescued animals all over the world, it has been one of the most challenging rescue operations ever.</description>

A federal jury rejected a Venice surfer&amp;rsquo;s claim that two LAPD officers unnecessarily punched and pepper-sprayed him in 2006, after he refused to follow a lifeguard&amp;rsquo;s orders to leave the water.
[&amp;hellip;]
Falk&amp;rsquo;s chief witness was &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; actress Jorja Fox, who said she had come to the Venice surf spot just before the confrontation took place.
She testified that she saw the police officers from the Venice Beach Foot Patrol handcuff Falk and &amp;ldquo;punch him in the face.</description>

**Question: I would ask if you knew if Jorja Fox was going to re-sign with CSI, but the chances of getting an answer are slim to none, right? &amp;#8212; ALS
Ausiello: Slim to none &amp;hellip; yes and no. I have an answer for you, but it&amp;rsquo;s sorta &amp;ldquo;nebulous.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Jorja and I haven&amp;rsquo;t sat down and talked about next season,&amp;rdquo; E.P. Carol Mendelsohn tells me. &amp;ldquo;But [she&amp;rsquo;s] definitely in the finale, and since the finale is a &amp;lsquo;to be continued,&amp;rsquo; I would say it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good bet that Jorja will be back for at least some or all of next season.</description>

And to boost the plots, comes back an old member : Sara Sidle, gone from the show since the beginning of the season 8. Officially, Jorja Fox left CSI in 2007 to do others projects. Unofficially, the 41 year old actress, tired of playing second fiddle, left after the production refused to increase her salary. Obviously, they came back with better propositions
Called to the rescue for a few episodes during season 9, Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s character becomes a regular during season 10.</description>

YOU know how entwined the character you play on screen is to your real life when die-hard fans raised enough money to fly banner-bearing planes over a television network demanding to keep your character from leaving.
Or when your name is Jorja Fox and a silly reporter (that would be me) greets you over the phone with an unthinking &amp;ldquo;Hi, Sara!</description>

Q: Tell us what is it like leaving CSI and then coming back again after a break?
A: Well when I was on CSI, I was really exhausted and literally crying. I said to the executive producer when I left that I would love to visit sometime.</description>

      <description>Welcome home, Jorja Fox. Even as we longed for her return as Sara Sidle (a.k.a. Mrs Gil Grissom) on CSI, Fox said she had been missing her onscreen persona, her cast-mates and the show terribly.
So much that she had to restrain herself from tuning in.
&amp;hellip;I stopped watching* CSI* because I figured the sadness would go away if I don&amp;rsquo;t watch it,&amp;rdquo; the 48-year-old actress said in a recorded interview.</description>

      <description>WHEN she announced that she was taking a break from acting three years ago, CSI fans flew planes over the Universal Studios film sets in California in protest.
But the banners they used, which read &amp;#8216;Keep Jorja Fox on CBS&amp;rsquo;, can now be kept away.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Jorja Fox, 42, will reprise her role as tough cookie forensic scientist Sarah Sidle on hit crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;s 10th season.</description>

Question: I&amp;rsquo;ve been a *CSI *(Las Vegas) fan from the beginning. But this season has just lost me. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Sara is back while Grissom is off in Paris? I thought their love story ended beautifully in the jungle. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;happy Sara&amp;rdquo; either. It just seems too OOC (out of character) for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about the Dr. Jekyll storyline the way I did with the miniature killer, blue-paint killer or the Paul Millander story.</description>

Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s only true if you happen to be doing a list like, say, The 50 Hottest Girls on Television; it won&amp;rsquo;t work if it&amp;rsquo;s a list of Best Carburetors.
