      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;9 Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle on &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
Last spring, in the last minute of the last episode of the season, Grissom (William Petersen) looked up from his bedtime reading at Sara (Jorja Fox) in the bathroom door, fresh from a shower. All this reticent fall, they haven&amp;rsquo;t touched and barely smiled, but their intimacy has a resounding vibe.

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; fans. CBS will not be changing the name of its hit drama to &amp;ldquo;When Sara Met Grissom.&amp;rdquo; But the network will continue to explore the love of these two forensic nerds.
Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the Top 10-rated series, says she&amp;rsquo;s excited about the possibilities. Fox says she&amp;rsquo;s excited that Sara and Gil are finally acting on the sexual tension in the series&amp;rsquo; seventh season.</description>

      <description>The Hit Show&amp;rsquo;s Seventh Season Has Been An Eventful One
The seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; has been a tumultuous one. So far, investigator Greg Sanders has been nearly beaten to death while Catherine Willows not only dealt with her daughter&amp;rsquo;s kidnapping but also with her father&amp;rsquo;s murder.
[&amp;hellip;]
It&amp;rsquo;s not only a tough job emotionally, the logistics of shooting &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; can also take a toll. Recently, the crew filmed two episodes at the same time.</description>

7. Yes, you might have seen Jorja Fox at a local restaurant. Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s (William Petersen) love interest on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; occasionally visits Western New York because she has relatives here.

      <description>As forensic sleuth Sara Sidle on the hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox has had her share of murders to solve. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a professional to figure out who the perpetrator is behind the deaths of the billions of animals killed for food every year &amp;#8212; namely, the meat industry. That&amp;rsquo;s why Jorja &amp;#8212; a longtime vegetarian &amp;#8212; jumped at the chance to shoot a provocative new pro-vegetarian ad for her friends at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia-Pacific.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox One of the most amazing things about today, not only is the food gonna be way better than it ever is at my place &amp;ldquo;(laughs)&amp;rdquo;, and, and, and, far more beautifully prepared, uh, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to cook or do any dishes I don&amp;rsquo;t think - maybe I do, but nobody&amp;rsquo;s told me yet so that&amp;rsquo;d be really fun. &amp;ldquo;(laughs)&amp;rdquo;

      <description>&amp;ldquo;My six-pack is not like most actresses&amp;rsquo; &amp;#8212; my six-pack is beer.&amp;rdquo;
From gritty crime scenes to sexy love scenes, JORJA FOX&amp;rsquo;s role on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has been through a lot of changes due to her new romance.
WITH HER TOMBOYISH demeanor and love of rock music, surfing, beer and dogs, no one, least of all actress Jorja Fox, would have predicted that she&amp;rsquo;d be in one of the most talked-about love affairs on TV this season.</description>

      <description>Translated from French
The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in season seven?
The producers keep it secret. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven&amp;rsquo;t though about killing Sara. She&amp;rsquo;s had almost everything else happen to her &amp;#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating &amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s been the team&amp;rsquo;s scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
It&amp;rsquo;s as if those procedural dramas, after spending years putting female crime victims through the wringer (and inside locked cages and under floorboards) have run out of ideas and moved on to harassing female crime fighters instead.
Yet it&amp;rsquo;s also the case that many shows &amp;#8212; facing softening ratings after many years on the air or tougher time-slot competition &amp;#8212; are attempting to inject more personal story lines into a genre that once regarded them like germs in the crime lab.</description>

      <description>If the revelation that Sara (Jorja Fox) and Gil (William Petersen) are having an affair came as a surprise to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans in May&amp;rsquo;s season finale, it was a surprise that was a long time coming. And not just because there have been little hints along the way.
Jorja Fox said that when she auditioned for the role of Sara, the &amp;ldquo;tiny little character description &amp;hellip; suggested that she was a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s played Sara Sidle in the hit American forensics drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for six years, but Jorja Fox says she still isn&amp;rsquo;t bored with the role.
Unfortunately though, some of her scenes still make her stomach turn, which is a bit of a problem for someone playing a forensic scientist.
&amp;ldquo;I had a bit of an epiphany about it this year. I&amp;rsquo;m not squeamish in general and I realised that it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m looking at that makes me squeamish, it&amp;rsquo;s the why and the how.</description>

LOVE, EXCITING AND IN THE WORKS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME: The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-finale shocker that Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) are an item wasn&amp;rsquo;t a spur-of-the-moment fling. It&amp;rsquo;s been in the works for six years, Fox said at the Television Critics Association&amp;rsquo;s summer meeting.
&amp;ldquo;In this tiny little character description that you get when you&amp;rsquo;re trying out for a show, it suggested that she was a love interest for Gil Grissom,&amp;rdquo; Fox said.</description>

      <description>For her part, Fox says she was &amp;ldquo;thrilled&amp;rdquo; to get the script pages with that intimate scene between Grissom and Sidle.
&amp;ldquo;I had sort of been gearing up from the beginning of the show that that might happen,&amp;rdquo; she told critics during the press session, noting that it&amp;rsquo;s never been entirely clear, even to those who work on the show, whether the two were an item before either arrived in Las Vegas to work as crime scene investigators.</description>

The revelation in the season finale was &amp;ldquo;hugely embraced by the audience,&amp;rdquo; Tassler said . although fan reaction, in fact, was split.
Count Fox as thrilled. The first description of Sara &amp;ldquo;suggested that she was a love interest for Grissom, (so) I had sort of been gearing up from the beginning of the show that that might happen.&amp;rdquo; She especially enjoyed the fact that &amp;ldquo;we suddenly find these characters together, and we don&amp;rsquo;t know how long has this been going on.</description>

&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; executive producers Naren Shankar and Carol Mendelsohn said the writers have had &amp;ldquo;raging debates&amp;rdquo; about the relationship between Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character Sara Sidle and her supervisor Gil Grissom, played by William Peterson. In the season-ending cliffhanger, the two were exposed as secret lovers.
[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja Fox says of her storyline: &amp;ldquo;The idea right now going into season seven, if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken, is that Grissom and Sara are the only people, and the beautiful audience, that know this is actually taking place.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation caught almost everyone off guard in the season finale when it was revealed that Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, the characters played by William L. Petersen and Jorja Fox, have had a thing going on for goodness knows how long.
Who knew?
Actually, Fox did. Given that the series has been almost all business, it might seem the detour into romance is a reaction to the move of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy into the Thursday-night-at-9 time slot this fall.</description>

CSI: Pasadena Since I took the liberty of skipping the CBS Digital Media Presentation (sorry; just say the word &amp;ldquo;multiplatform&amp;rdquo; to yourself about 75 times, and I swear it&amp;rsquo;ll be just like you were there), the last session of the day was for Television&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 Drama. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch this program (because I figure enough people do), so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what sorts of significant things were said. Jorja Fox is happy that her character, Sara, kissed William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character, Grissom.</description>

When he&amp;rsquo;s not on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; set, the slender, softspoken actor performs with an L.A. theater group, travels and is learning to surf.
&amp;ldquo;Jorja&amp;rsquo;s the real surfer,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s invited me to go with her, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll take her up on it.&amp;rdquo;</description>

So the top-rated network encouraged its prime-time producers to &amp;ldquo;make a lot of noise at the end of the season,&amp;rdquo; says CBS programing president Nina Tassler, with plot shocks like Mark Harmon&amp;rsquo;s character quitting his &amp;ldquo;NCIS&amp;rdquo; job and Aisha Tyler being killed on &amp;ldquo;Ghost Whisperer.&amp;rdquo; On the network&amp;rsquo;s top-rated &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; Tassler told critics yesterday, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re going to see a lot more of Grissom and Sara [Jorja Fox], which was hugely embraced by the audience last year.</description>

      <description>Even longtime viewers of CSI were surprised at the revelation at the end of last season that the characters of Grissom and Sara &amp;#8212; played respectively by William Petersen and Jorja Fox &amp;#8212; have been involved in a relationship for some time. Now, the biggest mystery on the show doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve the victim of the week, but how long that relationship has been going and how they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to keep it quiet all this time?</description>

The loyal audience of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; appears to be split 50-50 between approving this past season&amp;rsquo;s developing Gil Grissom-Sara Sidle romantic relationship, while the other half wants the show to focus on the forensic cases, said Jorja Fox, who plays Sara.
Since &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has focused so much on the procedural elements, &amp;ldquo;there are so many interesting stories we could still show&amp;rdquo; on the emotional side.
Fox has been with the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; since its second episode, but notes the Grissom-Sidle romance has been in the work for the past six seasons.</description>

      <description>Romance is on the cards for Sara and Grissom after a night of passion
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a headless corpse and the near-death of a colleague to get you in the mood for romance. At least this week that is how it seems in this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of US drama CSI.
In the final episode of the sixth series, Grissom is relaxing in his bedroom, when who should emerge from his bathroom wearing nothing except a silky robe and a warm smile but his colleague Sara Sidle!</description>

      <description>Move over, Madison. New names take hold.
The names of Saskatchewan babies suggest 2005 was a good year for the TV show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
While data from the province&amp;rsquo;s vital statistics bureau shows Madison, Emma, Emily and Olivia topped the list of Saskatchewan baby girl names last year, the oddly spelled Jorja made its appearance on the list at No. 30.
Twenty-four baby girls share their name with Jorja Fox, the sleuthing brunette actress who plays Sara Sidle on the popular forensics show.</description>

      <description>Question: Hey, Matt! I love your column and just wanted to say, as a sci-fi fan, I appreciate all the attention you give to those great yet underappreciated shows. Now to my question. What are your thoughts on TV&amp;rsquo;s growing trend of hooking up every character on a show with each other? I&amp;rsquo;ll use CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as an example because of the fuss the season finale created. The show was great because it focused on the stories and not the characters.</description>

      <description>CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION stars MARG HELGENBERGER and JORJA FOX will be showing off their singing skills as a duo at an upcoming charity concert. The actresses are reportedly working on a rendition of BEN E KING&amp;rsquo;s STAND BY ME for the fourth annual What A Pair benefit, which raises cash for breast cancer charities. Helgenberger, whose mother is a breast cancer survivor, is a longtime supporter of the event which, this year, will also feature the vocal talents of actresses JESSICA BIEL, LEA THOMPSON and JOELY FISHER.</description>

**Sara and Grissom have been having an affair for a long time on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;: ** See, I thought Brass&amp;rsquo; near death experience was a wake up call to Grissom but many of you think those two star-crossed lovers have been having an affair for awhile. They&amp;rsquo;ve just been keeping it from us (kind of like how we didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Sam and Jack on &amp;ldquo;Without a Trace&amp;rdquo;). I like this idea.</description>

      <description>One Final Question - Jorja Fox
What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be upstaged by strange fibers and fluids?
*CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* is the top-rated drama in the US, but there are two spin-offs now. Does it annoy you that CSI: Miami and now CSI: NY are sponging off your ratings?
Well, they say it&amp;rsquo;s a great form of flattery, right? I think in the beginning we were all quite afraid. Our show in the States had barely got on its legs and already we were going to have competition from the inside.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s been working in some of the best shows on US TV for a full decade - ER and The West Wing among them. But it&amp;rsquo;s CSI which has made her a household name. We spoke to the actress on set of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular show.
How is Season Six coming along?
It&amp;rsquo;s flying by - it&amp;rsquo;s almost over, which is weird, they go so fast now. The first couple of years you feel like three years of your life have passed when you finish a season, and now we blink and we&amp;rsquo;ve got five shows left or something.</description>

It deals with a bunch of kids that end up in a cult, and a spaceship is supposed to come get them. I loved that it had a little bit of mysticism in it. One of the scenes involves this girl who ends up in this abandoned barn. All of a sudden, the whole place starts to turn into white light and the barn starts to shake.</description>

CSI
(CBS)
&amp;ldquo; rating = &amp;ldquo;* * *
The finale word: Last year, CSI broke out of its normal pattern for a two-part finale that buried Nick alive. This year&amp;rsquo;s solid finale stuck closer to the show&amp;rsquo;s extremely popular formula - and yet it seemed to send many fans into a frenzy.
The fuss was not over the fate of a critically wounded Capt. Brass, perhaps because no one really thought his fate was in doubt.</description>

      <description>That sound you heard at 9 p.m. on May 18 was collective gasping from millions of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans as they watched an intimate scene from the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale, in which Gil Grissom (William Petersen) chatted casually with co-worker Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) &amp;#8212; in a bedroom.
The two investigators are in a relationship, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms. And it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;not so new.&amp;rdquo;
She says the show&amp;rsquo;s many law-enforcement contacts say that those who work in the crime field are often attracted to each other, due to shared experiences and interests.</description>

AS SARA SIDLE, one of the crack forensics experts in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox gets to wade through human body parts to solve murders. The show has two spin-off series, and is set to return for its seventh year in the US in September.
Did you think the show would become such a huge hit?

      <description>For a season finale, the series leaves viewers on a sour note and cranks up the cheese more than usual
You expect a certain amount of cheese when you watch CSI, but the season finale &amp;ldquo;Way To Go,&amp;rdquo; was much worse than usual. There were a number of lines, which I like to call groaners, that were added to get a laugh, but instead caused me to audibly groan to ease the pain inflicted by terrible writing.</description>

After the surgery, Brass pulls through. Everyone is happy. It&amp;rsquo;s how the episode ended that left me asking questions. Grissom was lying in bed talking about how he&amp;rsquo;d like to die. He wants cancer so he has time to plan out and enjoy his last few months. At first I thought he was talking to himself&amp;hellip; which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put past Gil.

      <description>Modest to a fault, Jorja Fox is gracious about what many would call the burden of fame and relentless scrutiny by the public that comes when starring on TV&amp;rsquo;s top rated show. CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;In general, I&amp;rsquo;m only surprised that people want to hear what I have to say at all, about anything,&amp;rdquo; she laughs. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m always, you want to interview me? OK. Sure!&amp;rdquo;
But Fox doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about her fabulous television career, doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to pose for the cameras in yet another glamorous photo shoot.</description>

      <description>CSI Colleagues Aren&amp;rsquo;t Just Pals
For years, fans of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; have been wondering: Is there more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye?&amp;rdquo; In the May 17 episode, we found out that the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
But now we have even more questions . and, as it turns out, so do the show&amp;rsquo;s stars. *The Early Show* co-anchor Julie Chen talked to the cast of the CBS primetime drama about their characters&amp;rsquo; futures.</description>

      <description>Julie Chen: &amp;hellip; were wondering if there was more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye. Well last night we found out, and the answer is definitely yes. Now we have even more questions, and so do the CSI stars. Last night&amp;rsquo;s episode was almost over when we heard Gil Grissom ruminating about the end of his own life.
William Petersen: And it&amp;rsquo;s a little scene, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a coda to the end of the season.</description>

      <description>Oh snap! &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; better watch out. It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale (warning, don&amp;rsquo;t read this if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-ender yet):
I got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: &amp;ldquo;The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a &amp;#8216;Bizarro World CSI,&amp;rsquo; as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death.</description>

      <description>Holy schnike! The nookie is confirmed! While seeing a shot of Sara in a robe coming over to our dear Gil in bed certainly was no great surprise, it still made my heart race. I was kind of hoping the long, drawn-out pan around the room and the true answer to &amp;ldquo;GG + ?&amp;rdquo; would lead us to something more shocking (like Brass&amp;rsquo; daughter, maybe), but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see this ending as well.</description>

Ausiello: Hi, Jorja.
**Jorja: **Sorry I&amp;rsquo;m a few minutes late. My very good friend, Eric Szmanda, who plays Greg Sanders, just did his last scene of the season, so there was a good three minutes of hugging going on.
Ausiello: You won&amp;rsquo;t see him now until July?
**Jorja: **No, I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to see him tomorrow night.</description>

      <description>Several Of The Actors Reflect On What Makes Them Tick
(CBS) &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is offering fans a lot more than the usual mix of felonies and forensics this season.
The hit CBS drama is also providing unique peeks at the inner workings of the minds of several of the characters.
The Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen took it even further when she spoke with several of the actors who portray those characters.</description>

Ausiello: Not sure what the cut on Nick&amp;rsquo;s neck means, but the badge is definitely a big clue and, based on the hints Jorja Fox dropped in last week&amp;rsquo;s AA, I&amp;rsquo;m betting the &amp;ldquo;GG + ?</description>

      <description>Trading forensic evidence in for a kickball craze
&amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda have an interesting way of unwinding after a long day on the set &amp;#8212; engaging in a good ole&amp;rsquo; game of kickball. Fox and Szmanda are members of the World Adult Kickball Association, playing for the Royal Blue Balls team. The pair played during a semifinal game last night at a field in North Hollywood, and TMZ was there to capture it.</description>

      <description>Will CSI Have a Cow Over Fox Spot?
Prime-time sleuth Jorja Fox is keeping a pretty meaty secret from her bosses at CSI: She recently posed for a pro-vegetarian ad for animal rights group PETA. No big deal, except the ad-which will be unveiled May 11 in LA-relies heavily on her CSI connection. Perhaps too heavily. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask for permission, which I probably should have,&amp;rdquo; confesses Fox, a longtime vegetarian.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit TV show CSI, manages to make dusting for fingerprints, collecting DNA, and examining cadavers look like the hottest job around. Now, Fox hopes to generate the same amount of buzz for vegetarianism as she has for forensic science. In her new ad for PETA, Fox encourages people to &amp;ldquo;investigate vegetarianism&amp;rdquo;-something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing for 20 years.
&amp;ldquo;[I]f you just cut down [on meat] or tried [vegetarianism], you might find that you love it,&amp;rdquo; Fox says in her exclusive interview with PETA.</description>

In the ad, Fox appears in a dimly-lit alleyway, which is cordoned off by police tape.</description>

Your reputation is on the line here! &amp;#8212; Jamie&amp;lt; Ausiello: I&amp;rsquo;ve read those spoilers, too, and all I can say is thank god I didn&amp;rsquo;t say I was 100 percent certain.</description>

      <description>JORJA FOX (CSI, Five, 9pm)
Age: 37.
Style: Fox by name &amp;hellip;
Significant others: Just her two cats and a dog.
Finest hour: Landing the role of CSI&amp;#8216;s Sara Sidle, straight after making the hit movie Memento.
Don&amp;rsquo;t mention: Pay rises. In 2004, Jorja and one of her CSI co-stars, George Eads, were fired from the show. Both denied they were holding out for more monet, and claimed their sackings were down to several misunderstandings.</description>

      <description>Whether she plays doctor Maggie Doyle on ER, or forensic investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, Jorja Fox always plays ambitious, smart and somehow a little standoffish women. &amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t have any boyfriends, no friends and no sex&amp;rdquo;, she says, quasi-sadly. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve played with George Clooney, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing with Gary Dourdan (Warrick on CSI), who&amp;rsquo;s currently on the list with the most beautiful men, but kissing with them, no chance.</description>

Season 5 is perhaps the shows most successful year to date. It&amp;rsquo;s always been a ratings winner - ever since the &amp;ldquo;Pilot&amp;rdquo; - but it&amp;rsquo;s clear from watching the fifth series that the producers have grown supremely confident. The budget seems even higher than before, helping CSI to match (or, in some cases, exceed) your average crime movie. The formula has become routine, and audiences know exactly what to expect.</description>

J is for Jorja. Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, and co-star George Eads were sacked from the show over a pay dispute that delayed the start of filming on the fifth series. The pair had argued for a pay increase but were later re-hired on the old salary - &amp;pound;50,000 per episode.

      <description>Jorja Fox has seen her character Sara Sidle go through a lot over the five and a half years &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; has been on the air, but the 6th season has been less tumultuous for Sara, even allowing her to help Nick Stokes (George Eads) as he grapples with the fallout from his ordeal in Grave Danger. Fox took the time to sit down with CSI Files to discuss the reunited CSI team, her complicated reactions to the team split in the previous season and Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationships with the other characters on the show.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rsquo;s *sexiest vegetarian on snatching (fake) bodies, carrying a torch for Grissom and the show&amp;rsquo;s all-star band.*
During her six years as a Las Vegas CSI, your character Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s life has been anything but idle. Was it tough becoming a walking tabloid? A couple seasons back, she was almost blown up. She got a DUI. Her boyfriend dumped her. Grissom [William Petersen] sort of dumped her. She had authority issues and I was wondering if she was always going to have them.</description>
