      <description>The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formed when Captain Paul Watson founded the Earth Force Society in 1977 in Vancouver BC, Canada. The original mandate of both organizations was marine mammal protection and conservation with an immediate goal of shutting down illegal whaling and sealing operations, but Sea Shepherd later expanded its mission to include all marine wildlife. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formally incorporated in the United States in 1981 in the state of Oregon.</description>
