      <description>During an earlier era on television, teens hung out at the malt shop or the burger joint. But today their meeting place is the mall &amp;#8212; and many of them work there.
What better place to set an earnest new miniseries aimed at teen viewers?
&amp;ldquo;Summer Stories: The Mall,&amp;rdquo; a three-part edition of the &amp;ldquo;ABC Afterschool Special,&amp;rdquo; premieres at 4 p.m. today (on Channel 13), with additional segments scheduled for the same time April 2 and 16 .</description>

In subsequent stories, Marla Clayton (Samaria Graham) will have to come to terms with her widowed mother&amp;rsquo;s pending remarriage, and Diane Dravecki (Jorjan Fox) will battle against slipping back into crack addiction.
Beneath the usual television gloss there&amp;rsquo;s a new grittiness, evident even in the casting, which clearly has tried to avoid stereotypically pretty new faces. Some of the actors, especially the intriguingly offbeat Ms. Fox, impressively convey the value of pure talent.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something different and ambitious from ABC&amp;rsquo;s Afterschool Specials series: its first miniseries. For the next three weeks, Summer Stories: The Mall will dole out tales of teens laboring in a suburban mall. (The Mall was filmed at the Nanuet Mall in Rockland County, N.Y.)
[&amp;hellip;]
There are also Marla (Samaria Graham) and Diane (Jorjan Fox), waitresses in one of the mall&amp;rsquo;s fast-food restaurants. Marla is perpetually cranky because her mom is remarrying without having consulted her, and because she has recently been passed over for a promotion to assistant manager.</description>
