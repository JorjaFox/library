      <description>&amp;ldquo;I love the idea of returning as an &amp;ldquo;invitee&amp;rdquo; to CSI&amp;ldquo;
In the United States, she has just returned to the series. Between Jorja Fox and CSI, it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat I love you &amp;hellip; me neither. The 41-year-old actress who plays Sara Sidle welcomes the return to her uniform. Even if her character has changed, including a marriage!
TELE STAR: You posed with Marg Helgenberger for some sexy photos. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time that the heroines of CSI are just as glamorous?</description>

      <description>This Thursday night (November 19) on CBS at 9pm, one of the most-watched shows on television, CSI (the original version, set in Las Vegas), will air a bowling-themed episode titled &amp;ldquo;Lover&amp;rsquo;s Lane&amp;rdquo; (watch the 30-second promo below) on which yours truly had the pleasure of working as a bowling consultant.
[&amp;hellip;]
As I made my way through the various set-pieces, word of my arrival must have somehow percolated through the building, as everywhere I went I overheard various actors and crew members giddily discussing bowling.</description>

      <description>The CSI Producer discusses the big crossover, what&amp;rsquo;s coming up in the remaining sweeps episodes of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and the return of a memorable nemesis. Lights spoilers inside!
November sweeps has already seen the historic first three CSI show crossover, but there&amp;rsquo;s more excitement to come, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; Producer &amp;ldquo;Allen MacDonald&amp;rdquo; promises. In addition to teasing the episode he&amp;rsquo;s at work on now-which brings back a familiar face-MacDonald discusses the return of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), the departure of Lauren Lee Smith and Nick Stokes&amp;rsquo; (George Eads) promotion.</description>

      <description>CBS couldn&amp;rsquo;t please their millions of fans more. Jorja Fox is back on CSI. Gone from Las Vegas since season 8, Sara Sidle is back ever since the first episode of season 10, currently airing in the US. There are many reasons to rejoice. TÃTUE.COM will tell you why.
Hallelujah! After two years absence, Jorja Fox is back on CSI. Thanks to her, the &amp;ldquo;butchest&amp;rdquo; of the CSI girls, Sara Sidle, is back in Vegas in Season 10.</description>

      <description>The latest puzzler for the &amp;#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;: How to stop a ratings slide that began with William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s departure last season and has continued into a new season, during which the granddaddy of forensic procedural dramas has lost its crown as TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated scripted series to &amp;#8216;NCIS&amp;rsquo;? Answer? Stunts, starting with extending Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the show from temporary (five episodes) to indefinite.
Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s Ausiello Files reports that &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; producers want to keep Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle around as long as they can.</description>

      <description>I think we all saw this coming, right? The return of Sara Sidle (uhh, Grissom) cannot be just for five episodes this season. Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the current season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; will be indefinite, which means we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of her than we initially thought this season.
&amp;ldquo;This season is about bringing the family back together again,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told Entertainment Weekly&amp;#8216;s Michael Ausiello.</description>

**Question: I’m thrilled Jorja Fox is sticking with CSI, but what about William Petersen? I want to see Grissom and Sara together. &amp;ndash;Alex
Ausiello: They were just together, albeit off screen. As exec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells me, Sara will reveal in this week’s episode that she “just got back from visiting Grissom in Paris.” Mendelsohn adds that, “We have no plans for Billy to return at the moment, but the door’s always open.</description>

      <description>This long-distance marriage thing seems to be working for Grissom and Sara on CSI. Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms to me exclusively that Jorja Fox’s five-episode comeback has been extended indefinitely.
“We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja,” says Mendelsohn. “The season is about bringing the [CSI] family back together again, so [this] was just a natural. Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.</description>

The length of Fox&amp;rsquo;s stay remains unknown but it will definitely be more than the five episodes she was originally scheduled for.</description>

Jorja Fox, who we will soon see back on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; guest stars as housewife in jail in desperate need of legal services on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; (Sunday, Lifetime, 9 p.m.). Do you remember a few years ago, when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; acted like they didn&amp;rsquo;t need Jorja Fox or George Eads and that basically the cast was replaceable a la &amp;ldquo;Law &amp;amp; Order?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that this hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out to be the case.</description>

&amp;ldquo;What A Fox! Your gorgeous &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cover (9&amp;frasl;28) proves what I&amp;rsquo;ve known all along: Jorja Fox is the sexiest woman on the show! Now if only the producers would bring her Sara back full-time as a lab tech and kick brown-noser Hodges to the curb. Welcome back, Jorja. We&amp;rsquo;ve really missed you.&amp;rdquo; - Maureen from N.Y.

&amp;ldquo;I have been counting the days till Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ever since it was announced in July that she&amp;rsquo;d be back.</description>

Question: I went to bed Thursday night thinking, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to ask Matt what he thinks of [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/ CSI],&amp;rsquo; and then Friday I saw there was a CSI [http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/csi/sara-is-back-2548.html recap] by Neil Turitz and found it SO RIGHT ON that I commented right away. I&amp;rsquo;d always loved the show and had high hopes for it after Gil left, thinking Laurence Fishburne would bring something different to the mix and the rest of the wonderful cast was still there (Sara had left already) so I gave it my all but it didn&amp;rsquo;t give back.</description>

Highlights of the Week Ahead
All times listed are Eastern Standard Time for September 28- October 4
[&amp;hellip;]
You know how sometimes I have to remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m only watching a TV show and the characters aren&amp;rsquo;t real? That&amp;rsquo;s EXACTLY how I felt when we found out Sara and Grissom are married on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.). I was so happy that those two crazy kids had finally found a way to make it work.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Trifecta: &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;CSI: NY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;
The mothership clearly had the strongest opening, with that stellar freeze-frame shot that traveled all through the lab, water droplets floating in the air, bullets rippling by. It was visually arresting, almost like a comic book come to life. So some actress died. The sad thing about being a procedural fan is that there are so many things you&amp;rsquo;re hip to, that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;ndash;like the fact that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cast Cromatie (Garret Dillahunt) from Sarah Conner unless he was doing some dirty.</description>

      <description>Sara returns to a team in transition.
[&amp;hellip;]
Sorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they&amp;rsquo;ve opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She&amp;rsquo;s badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris.</description>

      <description>I found out Jorja Fox was a KCRW fan when I spotted her at an event we put on earlier this year called RadioActive. She looked like all the other music lovers, ready to get her groove on! The actress is perhaps best known for her work in the hit CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as well as roles on ER and The West Wing, but her love of music is clearly a major part of her life.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like one of those long, cool, signature &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; tracking shots, but the one that opened the new season last night was a little longer and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, a lot cooler than the norm. We would even go so far as to call the shot &amp;ndash; which showed the entire team in freeze frame even though they were clearly in the middle of some kind of gun battle &amp;ndash; downright nifty.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Most Special Effect: The elaborate opening shot of CSI&amp;#8216;s opening episode was as dazzling as promised: a freeze-frame tableau of the lab&amp;rsquo;s violent invasion by gun-toting Russian mobsters. Shards of broken glass, blood spatter, bullet trajectories, gunshot flares, and bodies in various modes of action-hero motion, all frozen in a 3D-like tapestry of chaos. The episode that followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, either, and Jorja Fox is welcome back anytime, although we&amp;rsquo;re sorry we missed Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s wedding.</description>

      <description>The way I see it, it&amp;rsquo;s as if Sara Sidle never really left.
I mean, she left in the eighth, showed up on the ninth, and is sort of returning to the team for the tenth, which starts tonight, right? Then again, there are a lot of questions now that Sara&amp;rsquo;s back on CSI. You know, stuff about her reasons for her return, or what she&amp;rsquo;s been up to in between her first departure, her Costa Rican gig, and her return.</description>

&amp;ldquo;It feels amazing to be back. It feels wonderful,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Jorja Fox who plays Sara. Her fellow cast mates agree.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited,&amp;rdquo; said Marg Helgenberger who plays Catherine. &amp;ldquo;I love Jorja and I&amp;rsquo;ve missed her and she&amp;rsquo;s so much fun.</description>

JH: Original cast member Jorja Fox is coming back for a handful of episodes. Is she coming back in the same role with the CSI group or&amp;hellip;?
NS: In a sense, she is stepping into her old role but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a different Sara. The Sara who left was burnt out, was pretty messed up by the job and what happened to her but when she first came back there was a big question mark in her life which was the nature of her relationship with Grissom but that actually got resolved in a very happy way.</description>

      <description>One of the many conflicts about Thursday night TV is this:
I don&amp;rsquo;t watch CSI regularly (weak stomach), but the thought of Jorja Fox and Marg Helgenberger together forever with no Grissom in sight certainly earns the show a place on the DVR, even if I have to FF through the icky parts.
But a spoiler dropped this week turns out to be ickier than all of the carved corpses in creation.</description>

Ausiello: [http://www.people.com/people/videos/0,,20306231,00.html She got hitched to Grissom when no one was looking]. But that’s old news. Here’s some (relatively) new news from exec producer Naren Shankar: “Do not miss the first two-and-a-half minutes of CSI season premiere. It will blow your mind. It may be one of the most incredible things we’ve ever put on film.</description>

Jorja has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and, most recently, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be playing excerpts of songs she selected that have inspired her over the years, as part of KCRW&amp;rsquo;s Guest DJ Project.
Jorja Fox: Hi Michael.</description>

Also lending a hand is the returning Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who drops in to relieve Catherine&amp;rsquo;s shorthanded staff. Helgenberger says the character, who is newly married(!), is a great deal happier than when we last saw her.
&amp;ldquo;When Sara left CSI, she&amp;rsquo;d had it and couldn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore. She needed a big break,&amp;rdquo; Helgenberger says. &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s in a much better place now.&amp;rdquo;

Reporter: &amp;hellip; tell us about puppy mills?
Jorja Fox: Well, probably a lot of things. I think that puppy mills - it&amp;rsquo;s a very easy issue. You know, if people were more aware, if they knew more, it would be a given issue. Just because we used to put asbestos in our walls, and we used to put lead in our paint, and it was a great idea at the time, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s still a great idea.</description>

8. Getting Fooled Again
The last time &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans saw Sara Sidle, Grissom had surprised her in the jungle in season 9 and the two shared a steamy kiss. Now Jorja Fox is back again for five &amp;#8212; count &amp;lsquo;em, five! &amp;#8212; episodes in season 10. Is Grissom next?

While executive producer Anthony Zuiker was mum and [Jorja] Fox was cagey on some high-tech opening sequence that she&amp;rsquo;d only say &amp;lsquo;will knock your socks off,&amp;rsquo; [Marg] Helgenberger showed a little leg, or tried to. &amp;lsquo;It starts with this technique, it&amp;rsquo;s this lack of better way of describing it &amp;ndash; these specialty cameras, almost this freeze-action kind of thing &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the opening yet, but it was very arduous shooting it.</description>

Voiceover: Jorja Fox was even there. She is making her return to the show this season.
Dayna Roselli: Did you ever think, in the beginning, that it would be going on this long?
Jorja Fox: No! Never in a million years. Nor did I ever think, in a million years, that there&amp;rsquo;d be a museum that has our mugs in it, in Vegas. It&amp;rsquo;s really - we&amp;rsquo;re all very overwhelmed and touched and thrilled to be here.</description>

But don&amp;rsquo;t take Fox&amp;rsquo;s five-episode to mean that Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s happily-ever-after was a bust. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re absolutely together,&amp;rdquo; insists executive producer, Naren Shankar, who nonetheless says Sara will drop hints at trouble in paradise. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a coulpe of very independant individuals who have decided to share their life together.</description>

New Project: Um &amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;
You Can Go Home Again: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled for Jorja&amp;rsquo;s return to &amp;lsquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo;] said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The viewers and longtime &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode.&amp;rdquo;
Follow the (Ratings) Evidence: Looks like the addition of Laurence Fishburne hasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied viewers as much as producers had hoped, who acknowledge the drop in ratings and claim to be &amp;lsquo;listening&amp;rsquo; to fans who haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over last year&amp;rsquo;s departure of three original cast members.</description>

      <description>Just when I think we&amp;rsquo;ve heard enough about the developments on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; over the past week-Jorja Fox arriving for five episodes, and Lauren Lee Smith leaving entirely-then comes more. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve already heard some of these things, but I shall point your attention to this article&amp;rsquo;s title, somewhere up there. Yeah, exactly.
Executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar talked to &amp;ldquo;Entertainment Weekly**s Michael Ausiello, and discussed a little bit more about Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s return to the Las Vegas lab for the tenth season of the crime drama.</description>

What prompted her return? How long will she be sticking around? What impact will Sara&amp;rsquo;s reappearance have on the rest of the team? And, last but not least, is Grissom next? CSI showrunners Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar tackle all those Qs and then some after the jump.</description>

Do you people listen to me? Well, some of you do, and the rest of you should. Months ago, I told you about a conversation I had with Jorja Fox when she left &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; At the time, she told me that she&amp;rsquo;d be coming back to the show the next season, but many of you scoffed&amp;ndash;it couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, I was told. And now, poof, she&amp;rsquo;s back. Foxy returns in the season premiere on September 24th, and will be back for additional episodes.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; season 10 will see a lot of Sara Sidle but none of Riley Adams.&amp;rdquo;
One person in, another is out. While Jorja Fox is welcomed back as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;, an actor has to be let go because the character is not working for the whole show. The unfortunate one would be Lauren Lee Smith aka Riley Adams, the crime investigator who joined the unit in season 9.</description>

      <description>I guess people didn&amp;rsquo;t really warm to Riley Adams after all.
Lauren Lee Smith is not going to be back for the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, executive producer Naren Shankar told TV Guide Magazine. And, much like the departure of Kim Delaney on her first season in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s because the character just wasn&amp;rsquo;t working well as everyone had expected.
&amp;ldquo;It was an issue of how we were feeling the ensemble was working,&amp;rdquo; Shankar said.</description>

So what prompted your return to CSI?
Right around March, I felt really rested and was itching to work&amp;ndash;I was ready and going to meetings and auditioning. When I was in Atlanta [filming a guest shot on Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s Drop Dead Diva], I got the call about CSI&amp;ndash;it was completely out of the blue!</description>

That was the other thing: burlesque&amp;ndash;or at least Dita&amp;rsquo;s burlesque&amp;ndash;is big here. Big space: held at Avalon, which has a capacity to hold a few thousand people, and was sold out. There were multitudes of celebrities in the audience: we spied Margaret Cho and Jorja Fox, (of CSI: Las Vegas), as well as Jenny Lewis (or at least her exact replica). The size of L.A.&amp;rsquo;s geography lends itself to making burlesque seem more than a quick and dirty striptease in a tiny hovel of a club in the Lower East Side.</description>

Item two: It won&amp;rsquo;t be that much of a reunion. The biggest item on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; front is the return of Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle; it&amp;rsquo;s been confirmed that she&amp;rsquo;ll be appearing in the tenth season premiere, and in yet-to-be-disclosed extra episodes. Obvious question is, is Grissom returning? William Petersen is, sadly, not returning to the role. At least not yet.
But executive producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed that some classic characters will be returning to the series.</description>

      <description>When Oscar-nominated film star** Laurence Fishburne** joined the cast of CSI, it seemed like a natural match. CBS was replacing departing star William Petersen with a well-known face and presence.
Best of all, the network&amp;rsquo;s core hit was adding a black man as star in the same month Barack Obama would take office as the nation&amp;rsquo;s first black president.
But after an initial boost in viewership, ratings have sagged for Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s version of CSI.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m worried about &amp;ldquo;CSIs future. Given the poor reception Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s character has been getting, is there any chance CBS will replace him? &amp;ndash; David**
TIM: Nope. A network rep notes that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was still the highest-rated scripted show of the 2008-09 season, and Fishburne was the show runners&amp;rsquo; dream replacement for William Petersen. Also, he&amp;rsquo;s only had half a season to win fans over. Hopefully his use of deadly force in the May finale will herald more of a bold, commanding Fishburne (think &amp;ldquo;Boyz n the Hood&amp;rdquo;) and less of the bookish Professor Langston.</description>

Jorja left the show in its eight season, but returned a few times last year in its ninth season for guest appearances. When we last saw Sara, she was caught in an embrace with her bearded boyfriend Gil Grissom, who had left the lab behind for good to meet her in the jungle.</description>

      <description>**Jorja Fox returning to CBS&amp;rsquo; hit drama for multiple episodes. **
What does an actor do when they have an open invitation to return to one of television&amp;rsquo;s biggest shows? Come back, of course.
Actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s revolving-door relationship with &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; continues to spin, as CBS today announced the news that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back to play the popular character Sara Sidle when the forensics drama returns in the fall. Fox left the show as a regular in 2007, but made a short return (and was last seen) during William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s final episode of the show last season.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
When enormously popular William Petersen left CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last season, the series fumbled a couple of million viewers; toward the end of the ninth season, the procedural crime drama was clocking some of its smallest crowds ever, though it remained the country&amp;rsquo;s most watched drama series.
What to do? CBS announced Monday that Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, Petersen&amp;rsquo;s employee and love interest, is returning to reprise her role for &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; episodes.</description>

      <description>Admit it, that question is very much a natural, not after that long string of events stretching way back to the seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;-Sara and Grissom finally address their relationship, the Miniature Killer gets in the way, she leaves to address her past, he leaves to move on (to her, natch)&amp;hellip;
But yes, just in case you still can&amp;rsquo;t believe what you&amp;rsquo;ve read elsewhere, Jorja Fox is returning to the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When last we saw actress Jorja Fox on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, her alter ego Sara Sidle was deep in the Costa Rican jungle, happily reunited with the love of her life, Gil Grissom. Well, apparently Sara&amp;rsquo;s going to have some very good reason to leave that romantic idyll because come this fall, Jorja Fox is returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; for five episodes.
There&amp;rsquo;s no indication that William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Gil is joining her, although since Petersen is still connected to the show as an executive producer, he could decide to pop in for a show or two.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox left the grimy Las Vegas crime scenes of &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; for sun, surf and soul searching. But now she&amp;rsquo;s set to return as Sara Sidle for a much anticipated five-episode arc on the series&amp;rsquo; 10th season (premiering Sept. 24 on CBS). There&amp;rsquo;s wild speculation around the circumstances of her visit &amp;#8212; Is another CSI in danger? Are Sara and Grissom still together? &amp;#8212; and AOL TV grilled her mercilessly for the juicy details.</description>

      <description>Following an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama&amp;rsquo;s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will &amp;ldquo;reappear&amp;rdquo; in a September 24th episode where viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in its upcoming season.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a rocky relationship for Fox and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, with the actress leaving and returning once before over salary and contract disputes.
Her return will only be temporary, as she&amp;rsquo;s just signed on to star in a handful of episodes for the season. Thus far.
We&amp;rsquo;d advise her not to look a gift horse in the mouth this time!</description>

      <description>Bah, we all somehow saw it coming, right? After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she&amp;rsquo;s arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; which aired yesterday.
That detail&amp;rsquo;s been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was announced.</description>

Less than a year after walking off into the sunset jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as Sara for multiple episodes &amp;#8212; sans Grissom.
According to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn, Fox will reappear in the Sept. 24 episode when viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; team in Las Vegas.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox can&amp;rsquo;t seem stay away from &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;.
The actress &amp;#8212; who played a Las Vegas forensic scientist named Sara Sidle &amp;#8212; will be a part of the upcoming season premiere and additional episodes of the long-running CBS drama, the network said Friday.
Fox, who was a series regular since the show&amp;rsquo;s first season in 2000, officially left during its eighth season. (Although she was briefly seen last season, the Nov.</description>

The off-again, on-again &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star makes a guest appearance on Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; Sunday at 9 p.m., playing a soccer mom with a felonious past.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into an orange jumpsuit for years,&amp;rdquo; Fox told the Daily News. &amp;ldquo;I hope I pulled it off.&amp;rdquo;

The new season will have other changes; Lauren Lee Smith has left the show, and Mendelsohn said there is no casting going on at present to replace her character (though it sounded as that could change down the road). Because the lab is understaffed, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) will be back to work with her former colleagues for the first five episodes of the season.

      <description>I always get so excited for the Green with Glamour seasonal celeb photoshoots - they&amp;rsquo;re festive, fashion-y and oh-so-sexy! For the Spring/Summer 09 look, we were feeling pretty damned good about ourselves and went for a &amp;lsquo;top of the world&amp;rsquo; theme, deliciously shot on the rooftop of The Chapman Building (many thanks to GwG&amp;rsquo;s dear friend and loft tenant, Matthew Vafiadis!) The location was divine, but I have to admit the whole inspiration for our &amp;lsquo;world-topping&amp;rsquo; thing came once I knew the lovely Jorja Fox was on board to be our &amp;lsquo;model&amp;rsquo;.</description>

I have a whole new appreciation for Riley after &amp;lsquo;No Way Out&amp;rsquo; because any lady who takes pistol-whipping like that deserves hats off. I truly am looking forward to seeing Adams&amp;rsquo; character in depth, and Lauren Lee Smith is a talented individual. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she will soon become a favorite, and give the girl a break; it can&amp;rsquo;t be easy following in the footsteps of Jorja Fox. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Fox was so loved that some of the fans where near padlocking her to the set - not that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t donate a chain or two to that cause, as I am a die hard Sara Sidle fan and I miss her terribly, but we have to eventually move on guysâ¦.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox: It was breathtaking, it was magic. There was so much going on on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; that I certainly had never seen on television before. I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of it in feature films. The use of steady-cams &amp;hellip; you could do almost an entire act of the show in one sweeping, sort of solid, motion. It was a dance.</description>

Not only is Petersen an executive producer of the hit series, but he&amp;rsquo;s also busy planning a way to bring the bug-loving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; boss back next year with a European adventure. And for the first time he has confirmed there will be a &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; film.
[&amp;hellip;]
But even more pressing is his plan to bring Grissom back next season in a two-part television story set in France.
&amp;ldquo;We have an idea for how it would happen - now Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) and I are out of the show, we could pull something off in Europe without disrupting the other episodes they have to shoot.</description>

&amp;lsquo;The first time Anthony Edwards directed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, he had this epic idea to shoot all of act two as one fluid Steadicam shot. We came in and rehearsed it all morning like a stage play.
The scene took place in the emergency room and included almost the entire cast and recurring cast and several guest actors &amp;ndash; maybe thirty actors altogether. If I remember right, the camera followed Laura Innes&amp;rsquo;s character, Dr.</description>

      <description>Crime Scene Investigation has long been the televisual highlight of the week in my house, so it was with some sadness that I tuned in last week to witness the apparent demise of one of the show&amp;rsquo;s greatest assets: the relationship between team supervisor Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). What made this portrayal of heterosexuality so notable was not anything intrinsically subversive about its set-up (older, more powerful guy gets it on with younger, more attractive woman) but the refreshingly non-formulaic way it was represented.</description>

 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Why, oh why, must it be Sara? Office romance is inevitable sometimes and their relationship was hinted at early on in the series.
 Understandably, working closely together at the crime lab and crime scenes leave little time for both Sara and Grissom to do any socialising. Plus, they share the same interests &amp;ndash; bugs, blood, logic.</description>

**20. Gil/Sara/Lady Heather, &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;
History: Forensic examiner Gil Grissom (William Petersen) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly lucky with the ladies. Dominatrix-turned-therapist Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) only comes into his life when she&amp;rsquo;s a murder suspect, when her daughter is murdered and when her kinky past is helpful to Grissom in solving a case. As for his subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), their relationship is only hinted at until he proposes in season 8.</description>

Is she or isn&amp;rsquo;t she Jorja Fox resumed her role on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as Sara Sidle, one of the hottest forensic scientists on the block. CBS had thousands of viewers popping antacids as they anxiously awaited word on whether the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer&amp;rdquo; had offed Sidle, his last victim. Thank God the network negotiated a deal to have Fox stick around for a few guest spots on season nine. Last week Grissom (William Petersen) passed the baton and said farewell to a life of blood and gore before showing up unexpectedly in the jungle to surprise Sara with a little monkey lovin&amp;rsquo;.</description>

Q CSI has been a hit since its debut. So why would the producers drop three of its biggest stars: William Petersen, Jorja Fox, and Gary Dourdan?
*&amp;ndash;Ala Smith, Clovis, Calif.*
A After eight years, viewers get tired of the same faces&amp;ndash;and actors get bored doing the same thing. Those three stars all left voluntarily. Incidentally, while Marg Helgenberger has survived the CSI upheaval, she and actor Alan Rosenberg recently separated after 19 years.</description>

      <description>Hell yeah!
With sincere apologies to the male fans, I&amp;rsquo;m going to believe the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; writers wrote this William Petersen swan song especially for me &amp;#8212; okay, me and the millions of other female viewers &amp;#8212; who believe a happy ending is possible for just about anyone, even a moody sleuth in a perpetual state of emotional lockdown. Sappy sendoff? Perhaps. Satisfying? You bet &amp;#8212; especially since the last cast member to take a permanent hike (alas, poor Warrick) did it in such a depressing and tragic manner.</description>

**Grissom&amp;rsquo;s farewell to &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;
SPOILER ALERT! Discussion of the final scene in Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s last episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; follows. Read on at your own risk.
That last scene in last night&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; saw Grissom (William Petersen) trekking through a Costa Rican jungle, coming upon Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and swooping her into his arms for a big Hollywood kiss. It was essentially a reverse of the way Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) departed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; with Doug Ross (George Clooney) coming back to fly away with her.</description>

      <description>The final moment of Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; career &amp;#8212; and the surprise first moment of the rest of his life &amp;#8212; were in the planning stages for two years.
That may be why the closing scene of Thursday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was so satisfying. Yes, we are going to discuss spoilers here, so run to your DVR or cbs.com and get caught up. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
The departure of William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character from in front of the camera was mapped out in long conversations between two of the show&amp;rsquo;s two executive producers, Petersen and co-star Jorja Fox, according to Carol Mendelsohn, one of the showrunners on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; who has been overseeing production of the show since episode one.</description>

      <description>Q: Any update on the Dusty Springfield movie Kristin Chenoweth is starring in besides what Kristin said about it in her interview last month?
&amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash; Sinclair, Amsterdam&amp;rdquo;
A: According to industry sources, the film (which we first reported on in 2005) is very much on the fast track, and out writer/director Jessica Sharzer has just turned in a polish of her screenplay.
But Viacom and CBS reportedly have a competing project in the works produced by &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox and based on the live stage show Stay Forever: The Life and Music, written by and starring Kirsten Holly Smith.</description>

There will definitely be Sara and Grissom stories throughout all of this for sure. And it continues to be one of my favourite parts of the show- love lives and the little bit of romance lives and at the end of the day there is a light there in the midst of all this darkness.</description>
