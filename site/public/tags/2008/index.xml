      <description>The City Council temporarily halted construction of a new $42 million elephant exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo on Wednesday amid concerns over funding and a debate over whether the animals should be kept in zoos at all.
The vote came after the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association offered to pay an additional $14 million to finish the exhibit.
[&amp;hellip;]
At the council meeting, activists and celebrities including comedian Lily Tomlin and actress Jorja Fox said the zoo&amp;rsquo;s costly exhibit would do nothing to alleviate painful foot diseases that often lead to death among captive elephants.</description>

      <description>The Obama campaign is going to do wonders for the gang running Artists &amp;amp; Athletes, the nonprofit that has found its niche within the confines of Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s interest in and naivetÃ© about Washington.
Last night the ballroom at the Four Seasons in L.A. was filled with 140 agents, publicists, managers, writers, producers, directors and actors who filed in to listen to Mark Halperin moderate a panel discussion about what to expect from Washington.</description>

      <description>On yesterday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Leave Out All the Rest&amp;rdquo;), recently departed CSI Sara Sidle sends Gil Grissom a .mov file -slash- Dear John &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo; over the internets. Look closely, and you can briefly see her email address flash across the screen: info@seashepherd.org. ZOMG! Sara is sailing with the crew of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society!
Of her adventure with Captain Paul Watson and his band of anti-whaling pirates, Sara says,</description>

Question: Have we really seen the last of Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Last week&amp;rsquo;s ending of Episode 2 was heartbreaking. The creators have invested years hinting at, building up and finally revealing the relationship between Gil and Sara. I appreciate that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all hearts and flowers, but now that Petersen is leaving the show anyway, why not let these two tortured characters have a happy ending together? â Patrice</description>

      <description>I WAS shocked at the amount of wrinkle-relaxing poison in the face of Jorja Fox when I watched CSI last week. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any. She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.
She was back for Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues&amp;rsquo; face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn&amp;rsquo;t look remotely upset, even though she said she was.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised to learn that so many of you got choked up at the gut-wrenching scenes from Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, but I was taken aback by some commentary regarding Sara&amp;rsquo;s appearance &amp;ndash; namely, whether or not she was with child, and if her condition would eventually explain her abrupt decision to leave Las Vegas last season. All I can say is &amp;ndash; good God, no. Look, I hated her poofy dress (and the curls she wore with it) probably as much as the next fan, but never in my wildest dreams would I have considered she was trying to cover up a secret pregnancy.</description>

Jorja Fox: Maybe. Maybe I am, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not.
Ausiello: I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the first episode, and you were there.
Fox: Yeah, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely there for that.
Ausiello: And a couple more there.
Fox: Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m visiting for a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;ll be in and out, so that&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. I knew that might happen, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was gonna happen so soon.</description>

      <description>*Jorja Fox:** I think it&amp;rsquo;s my second or my third year at this party. I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest party person. Yeah, no it&amp;rsquo;s super fun, it&amp;rsquo;s been super fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve even had a friend come in from out of town and she&amp;rsquo;s so excited.
Interviewer: Unintelligible
Jorja Fox: I think it&amp;rsquo;s a convergence of a lot of different people who almost never get to see each other. That&amp;rsquo;s number one. And because so many people are coming out tomorrow night anywhere, they&amp;rsquo;re here, they&amp;rsquo;re getting ready, they&amp;rsquo;re excited, they&amp;rsquo;re adrenaline is high.</description>

Question: So, you are one of the lucky privileged people who got to see the premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; early. What is the deal with Grissom-Sara? All of these interviews and articles make it sound like their relationship is in huge amounts of trouble. &amp;#8212; Sarah
Ausiello: I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any signs of trouble in the first episode, but the hour isn&amp;rsquo;t really about them; it&amp;rsquo;s about Warrick. If anything, the one significant scene they &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; share in the Oct.</description>

      <description>The well-heeled wore their compassion on their designer threads as hundreds of animal lovers turned out Saturday evening for a star-studded gala at the Animal Acres farm animal sanctuary.
Celebrities such as actors James Cromwell, Jorja Fox, John Schneider, Marc Vann and Alicia Silverstone were among the approximately 300 people who mingled with the sanctuary&amp;rsquo;s 150 cows, pigs, goats, turkeys and chickens for an evening of vegan food, music and entertainment.</description>

Lauren Lee Smith (&amp;ldquo;The L Word&amp;rdquo;) will also join the cast in episode 3 as a young and sarcastic &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; named Riley Adams. But perhaps the most noteworthy season 9 addition is a blast from the past. Jorja Fox &amp;ndash; whose character, Sara Sidle, walked out on both her job and her engagement to Gil &amp;ndash; will return, just 11 months after quitting the show, to help solve the murder of Dourdan&amp;rsquo;s Warrick Brown.</description>

      <description>None of us wanted her to go, least of all Gil Grissom &amp;hellip; so it&amp;rsquo;s great news that Jorja Fox, aka CSI Sara Sidle, will return to reprise her role in season nine. Fox is expected to appear in the first three episodes of the year as the team lay Warrick Brown to rest.
Don&amp;rsquo;t bank on any resolution to the truncated love-story between Grissom and Sara, though. As Fox recently told &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, talking about their feelings isn&amp;rsquo;t something the pair find easy: &amp;ldquo;As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous.</description>

The whole thing was simply huge, and security was unlike anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced, even when I visited Guantanamo Bay. Fencing, TSA, you name it, police were everywhere. And it was like walking into a television set. The celebrities were everywhere. Chevy Chase, Jorja Fox (late of CSI), guys from &amp;ldquo;The Daily Show&amp;rdquo; Rosey Grier (in a wheelchair and gray-haired now) Rep. Murtha, Spike Lee, Blizter, and so on and so forth.</description>

I was afraid that our celebration wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel very intimate in such a huge venue but the architects who put the show together did an amazing job. I wandered around trading pins for the first couple of hours; got a picture taken with Roland Martin and saw Jessie Jackson.

&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox stopped in for a cold one after she had just purchased a &amp;ldquo;Bark Obama&amp;rdquo; doggie bandana for her 12-year-old boxer. Fox said she&amp;rsquo;s been a Barack Obama fan since she watched his keynote address at the 2004 convention, the moment that sent his political career into the stratosphere. &amp;ldquo;I just feel blessed to be a part of it,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Every major historic event in history needs a devoted and excited audience and I get to be one of those people.</description>

      <description>There was a Fox loose in City Hall last week: Jorja Fox, star of hit TV show CSI: Las Vegas, visited Austin on July 11 to highlight a new report on animal cruelty in traveling circuses.
[&amp;hellip;]
As part of a cross-country tour, ADI spokesperson Fox presented Council Member Lee Leffingwell with a copy of the report. Referring to &amp;ldquo;The ABCD&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; acquisition, brutality, confinement, disposal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that are an inherent part of the circus industry, she highlighted the success of human-performer-only circuses like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese State Circus.</description>

      <description>Circuses advertise a joyful, colorful form of entertainment, but for circus animals, the shows hold dark promises of horrible living conditions that force animals into miserable confinements, according to animal advocacy groups.
Circuses featuring exotic animals may be banned from Austin in the future after Animal Defenders International, an animal rights group, presented an abuse report to the Austin City Council Friday.
The London-based group asked Austin City Council to ban these circuses in the city of Austin as part of the group&amp;rsquo;s nationwide campaign.</description>

Leffingwell accepted a letter, report and DVD from Fox, on behalf of the campaigning group, which asks for the city council to consider a ban on animal circuses in light of the evidence presented by ADI&amp;rsquo;s report and undercover footage.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; is known for fighting crime. Now the actress is taking a stand against wrong-doers in real life, too.
Fox, well known for her prominent role as Sara Sidle on the CBS hit, is campaigning against the suffering of circus animals. She will hand deliver copies of a new scientific report on the circus animal abuse to officials at Austin&amp;rsquo;s City Hall on Friday.</description>

      <description>Pamela Anderson isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one crackin&amp;rsquo; jokes about Jessica Simpson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Real Girls Eat Meat&amp;rdquo; T-shirt.
&amp;ldquo;But I think that [T-shirt] phrase can be interpreted in many different ways,&amp;rdquo; quipped CSI star and longtime animal-rights activist Jorja Fox. &amp;ldquo;We should ask Jessica what meat she was referring to, because there are several out there.&amp;rdquo;
But is Fox truly upset over the shirt?
&amp;ldquo;I think Jessica Simpson has every right to her opinion, but I&amp;rsquo;m not offended by it at all, because it was done in jest,&amp;rdquo; Fox assured me earlier today.</description>

Nerdiest Cop: Sara Sidle, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;
You gotta love her: She&amp;rsquo;s dry, supersmart, slightly damaged and obsessed with cadavers. The original &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t what you&amp;rsquo;d call a character-driven show, but Sara Sidle has more personality than all her co-workers combined. Too bad depression got the best of this geek guru. We can only hope for the surprise return of her character &amp;#8212; and, hopefully, no more lab explosions.</description>

Q Will actress Jorja Fox ever return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?&amp;ndash;Betty Rudder, Mascot, Tenn.
A We&amp;rsquo;ve received dozens of letters like yours since Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in November and told us she needed a break from the daily grind. She then turned down several TV movies to focus on producing a musical about the late singer Dusty Springfield, which was staged in L.A. earlier this year. But Jorja, who&amp;rsquo;ll turn 40 this week, always hoped to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, and fans will be thrilled to learn that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back on the season premiere this fall.</description>

Jorja&amp;rsquo;s Coming Back to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;
When Jorja Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last fall, producers promised it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the last fans would see of her. They&amp;rsquo;ll hold up their end of the bargain when the actress&amp;rsquo; Sara returns to the crime drama for it&amp;rsquo;s third episode next season. &amp;ldquo;It involves an old friend of Sara&amp;rsquo;s who has to confront a [life or] death situation with his wife,&amp;rdquo; she teases.</description>

      <description>Inside sources reveal top secrets about the season&amp;rsquo;s biggest burning questions
[&amp;hellip;]
Why did CSI&amp;rsquo;s Warrick have to die (and was the story line influenced by Gary Dourdan&amp;rsquo;s real-life troubles)?
&amp;ldquo;Executive Producer Carol Mendelsohn says&amp;rdquo;: We thought that if we ever lost Warrick [Dourdan], this was the way he would go. Warrick&amp;rsquo;s a local guy. The only family he had was Grissom [William Petersen] and the team, so this was not a guy who was going to leave Las Vegas or CSI.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans have not seen the last of Sara Sidle. In fact, the time has come for fans to welcome one of the key players of the forensic drama, Jorja Fox, whose character left the series in the season 7 episode &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck&amp;rdquo; where she had to go face the ghost of her past.
According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, the 39-year-old actress has just inked a deal to return for &amp;ldquo;CSI**s ninth season premiere next fall.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; boss Carol Mendelsohn wasn&amp;rsquo;t pulling my leg when she told me last October that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the last of Sara Sidle. Sources confirm that Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return for the show&amp;rsquo;s ninth-season premiere next fall.
Specifics of her comeback are being kept under lock and key, but my &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; mole assures me that she &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t be appearing in a flashback.&amp;rdquo; The likely scenario has Sara returning to Vegas to shag Grissom mourn ex-colleague Warrick, who was shot (and presumably) killed in last week&amp;rsquo;s finale.</description>

      <description>When Sara left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, driving out of Las Vegas on her way to who knows what, he left behind a brokenhearted Gil Grissom. The producers of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; were wise to keep the door open for the character to return, and that&amp;rsquo;s just what&amp;rsquo;s happening &amp;#8212; at least for one show. According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, Jorja Fox will be in the season premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. Oh, and she won&amp;rsquo;t be the only former cast mate on the show; so will Gary Dourdan as Warrick.</description>

Recycling, obviously, I think we&amp;rsquo;re all doing that in California. I&amp;rsquo;m amazed.

Question: What happened to Catherine finding the picture of Grissom and Sara that was teased all week? That scene sure wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; I watched on Thursday! â Kathy
Ausiello: Good question â let&amp;rsquo;s ask exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The scene where Catherine finds Sara&amp;rsquo;s picture on Grissom&amp;rsquo;s fridge is really fun.

Due to the limitations of this presentation, certain aspects of the show couldn&amp;rsquo;t be fleshed out &amp;lt;&amp;gt; making it somewhat unclear whether this was an actual play or a very good lounge act. What is undeniable is that Kristen Holly Smith is a goldmine of talent and knowledge (she co-wrote the piece).</description>

*Last Saturday (Mar 2) saw Jorja Fox with 3 non-celeb friends (2 guys and a girl) buying wine a bit after 10pm at CapNCork on Hillhurst in Los Feliz. She was in jeans, green shirt and white vest, hair down, no makeup and looking very casual but easily recognizable.

t was quite the celebrity day in Hollywood today. I just barely saved myself from looking like a total jackass to CSI star, Jorja Fox. Here&amp;rsquo;s the scoop: Being &amp;ldquo;on deck&amp;rdquo; at my voiceover agency to audition, means lingering my the desks of the assistants, who are awesome. I enjoy chit chat with the Tallest-Assistant-In-The-World, Jeff, who is almost 7 feet and hilarious. On Jeff&amp;rsquo;s desk last week, was a notice for a show at the LBGT Center, produced by Jorja Fox.</description>

      <description>If ever a TV couple shared some great chemistry it&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom.
But after years of successfully concealing their relationship from their colleagues - and from us - no sooner is the cat out of the bag, than Sara&amp;rsquo;s off.
So now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if maybe it was just the secrecy that was the real attraction for Sara, and the thought of being able to hold hands with Gil in the CSI canteen and drive in to work together each day is just too mundane for words.</description>

Speaking of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, former regular cast member Jorja Fox is now able to enjoy doing the other things she was raring to sink her teeth into when she decided to leave the show earlier this season. Since quitting as CSI Sara Sidle, Fox has had the opportunity to work on one of her dream projects.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m producing a musical about the life and music of Dusty Springfield called &amp;ldquo;Stay Forever&amp;rdquo; in Los Angeles at the Renberg theater,&amp;rdquo; Fox told Variety.</description>

Jorja Fox: You get &amp;ndash; you come into the theater and you&amp;rsquo;re like &amp;ldquo;Ah, I know that one song, it&amp;rsquo;ll be great&amp;rsquo; Never mind what an amazing colorful story she had, in what an amazing colorful times. Then you get in there and you actually know the songs, and you&amp;rsquo;re like &amp;ldquo;Oh wow!&amp;rsquo;

      <description>Jorja Fox and Kirsten Holly Smith talk about the life and music of Dusty Springfield.
For millions the music and life of Dusty Springfield has grand significance. More specifically, as a woman who was producing music in the man&amp;rsquo;s world of music making, a performer who professionally protested Apartheid (before it was de rigueur) and a household name who came out of the closet, Springfield&amp;rsquo;s music and life meant much more to specific groups such as women, blacks and gays.</description>

NZTVG: How did you feel about Jorja Fox (who plays Sara Sidle) leaving the show this season?
Marg Helgenberger: We only shot a couple of episodes more after she left but it was sad. Everybody reacted very differently and you don&amp;rsquo;t even really think about it until you have the party and it&amp;rsquo;s your last day and everyone shows up. Then it becomes the big, emotional thing. It hit some people really hard that day.</description>

      <description>Interviewer: All right, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk all about this play and everything Jorja related, but you, you made sort of a conscious decision - you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve been on this very successful show, and then, you left. What, what, what &amp;ndash; was that a real soul search, or was it &amp;ldquo;gee, it&amp;rsquo;s time&amp;rdquo;?
Jorja Fox: Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah, very very much. It was harder to leave than it was to stay, for sure.</description>
