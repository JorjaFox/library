      <description>Jorja Fox of CSI fame celebrates her birthday today, so we take a look at how she spends her time off screen promoting plant based living.
She has been a vegetarian since she was 19, an aspiring vegan and has worked with PETA to help highlight the benefits of going veggie. She has also worked with ADI to inform people of the cruelty that goes on in circuses around the globe.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;d make a joke about deja vu, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the memory anomaly at the center of Memento, which first hit American theaters in limited release on March 16, 2001 – 15 years ago this week.

7. It provided a stepping-stone role for Jorja Fox Fox appears in a small role, as Leonard&amp;rsquo;s wife in his flashbacks. She was essentially unknown at the time, but just a few months later she&amp;rsquo;d become much better-known to mainstream audiences when she joined the first-season cast of CSI.</description>

      <description>SELLER: Jorja Fox
LOCATION: Los Angeles, CA
PRICE: $1.85 million
SIZE: (approx.) 3,600 square feet, 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms
YOUR MAMA’S NOTES: A well-maintained, circa 1937 Mediterranean with loads of intact original architectural details in the hipster-chic Silver Lake area of Los Angeles — owned, according to our resources, by actress and producer Jorja Fox — has come available at $1.85 million. Miz Fox isn’t a tabloid superstar or even a gossip glossy regular, and we’d bet the farm she prefers it that way.</description>

AVC: So were you happy to come back in order for Gil and Sara to literally sail off into the sunset?
WP: Well, yeah, that was kind of… [Hesitates.] I mean, what are you going to do after all these years and everything, and you’re supposed to do a wrap-up in two hours? If they’d said, “Why don’t you do a wrap-up over several episodes?” we’d’ve done something different. But they sort of just sprang it on us after they canceled the show.</description>

In Praise of CSI&amp;rsquo;s Happy Ending Question: Several years ago, I wrote to you regarding my extreme disappointment in CSI for divorcing Grissom and Sara, the series&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;long ship&amp;rdquo; known as GSR. Well, you were the voice of reason, saying that you hoped William Petersen would be back for the end. Thankfully, you were right. Although I still think they should not have been separated, the end of the finale was oh so satisfying.</description>

At some point in the episode, another woman blows herself up, this time, it&amp;rsquo;s a Lady Heather doppleganger outside of the mistresses&amp;rsquo; house. When the lookalike&amp;rsquo;s car explodes, Brass catches on fire, but once he&amp;rsquo;s extinguished by a fast-acting Sara, he stands there like a total bad-ass, proving once again that the former captain&amp;rsquo;s cajones are made of â¦ well, brass.
Gil&amp;rsquo;s in Vegas, sees his ex-wife Sara (#Awkward), and runs into a chipper redhead who flummoxes him to no end.</description>

Despite Lady Heather&amp;rsquo;s rivalry with Sara Sidle over the years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone wanted her to be a true terrorist, and CSI obliges. It&amp;rsquo;s a frame job, and when the real terrorist shows up&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s played by frequent baddie Doug Hutchinson&amp;ndash;we know immediately where the episode is going. Regardless, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, as this was an episode about bringing together the original team and sending them off in a way that pleased fans who showed up earlier in the show&amp;rsquo;s run as well as the fans who stuck around for the series over the long term.</description>

      <description>Full disclosure: I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in years, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean tonight wasn&amp;rsquo;t a total emotional roller coaster for me.
I watched every single episode for the first nine seasons at least, and even stuck around for a couple more after Grissom left (and broke my heart in the process).
[&amp;hellip;]
I loved CSI, and I never really stopped loving it. I just kind of grew up and apart from the show, just as the original characters grew apart from each other (looking at you, Grissom and Sara).</description>

      <description>Confession: I have never purposefully watched an episode of CSI. Or any of its spinoffs.
[&amp;hellip;]
 Sarah and Catherine, are they frenemies? I feel tension? I feel history? Tempted to Google, but that feels like cheating.  [&amp;hellip;]
 Wait, Sarah and Petersen were MARRIED?! Is that why there was tension with her and Marg&amp;rsquo;s character?! Love it.  [&amp;hellip;]
 Sarah and Gil&amp;rsquo;s (I&amp;rsquo;ll call him that from now on, not Petersen) first encounter.</description>

Jorja Fox, one of the show&amp;rsquo;s original cast members, has said in previous interviews that she didn&amp;rsquo;t think anyone would watch the series when it first premiered in 2000. She could not have been more wrong. The drama about a forensics investigation division in Las Vegas was an instant smash.
During its 15-year run, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; spawned three spinoffs and became one of TV&amp;rsquo;s most popular series, in the U.S. and internationally.</description>

      <description>In the end, &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; died as it lived: fun, flabby, and altogether too invested in the undying love of two deeply sexless characters.
[&amp;hellip;]
Though Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return for the series finale gave the show a badly needed jolt of original &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; magic, it also meant that the love story of Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle returned to center stage.
Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, was another of the show&amp;rsquo;s originating characters.</description>

      <description>While CSI has been one of the longest-running shows of the decade, its series finale drew almost no digital buzz. Amobee Brand Intelligence analyzed the engagements around the finale and found that just a few fans were called to action last night, which either means that CSI is more a of a VOD hit than anything else or that everyone was watching ABC, which premiered Quantico and Once Upon a Time last night.</description>

Still, it was hard to complain about that, when the show not only brought back Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), but the long-since-gone Grissom (William Peterson) and- be still my heart- even Lady Heather, aka Dr. Kessler (Melinda Clarke). I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Grissom was as wonderfully grizzled and nerdy as ever, (Sara) sidling back into the role as if no time whatsoever had passed. As such, it was probably inevitable that he would get the most screen time, but I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s as it should be.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Grissom and Sara ended up together &amp;ndash; for good this time, we assume.&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
For a moment it seemed like the on-again, off-again lovers might go their separate ways, but come on. There&amp;rsquo;s no way that was happening. Instead, Sara left Vegas and flew to San Diego to join Gil on his boat. The pair literally sailed off into the sunset.&amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; was never the subtlest show.

      <description>After 15 years, 335 episodes and countless grisly death scenes, &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; said goodbye with a TV movie entitled &amp;lsquo;Immortality.&amp;rsquo; It was a chance to bid adieu to old friends, wrap up some loose ends, and watch a television institution ride off into the sunset.
But in true &amp;lsquo;Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; fashion, it was also an opportunity to bring some grisly drama. With Las Vegas itself under attack, would the return of Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows and Jim Brass help save the day?</description>

DEADLINE: Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the final scene of Gil and Sara sailing off into the sunset. How did that ending come about?
ZUIKER: SixteenÂ years ago, William Petersen, (executive producers) Cindy Chvatal and Jonathan Littman and myself sat down at the Beverly Wilshire, that was the first time we got together.Â We actually met there 16 years later, same table, same party of four. And William Peterson pulled out this research folder that dealt with sea shepherd.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Still, it was interesting seeing this most coldly logical of mystery shows indulge its romantic side. At one point in the finale, a mysterious bad guy sends in a face-scrambling video message straight to Grissom: &amp;lsquo;The grand finale is specifically designed for you.&amp;rsquo; That vibed like a meta mission statement for &amp;lsquo;Immortality,&amp;rsquo; which worked best as an extremely melodramatic triangle between Grissom, longtime antagonist/ambiguous love interest Lady Heather, and even-longer-time ally/ex-wife Sara.</description>

Will there be closure for Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle?
You have to watch. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how they edited it so who knows?
They are teasing a lot about it in the trailer.
Of course, they are. I am always leery of saying much about it. With the technology and everything, everybody is going to find out anyway.</description>

      <description>Gil Grissom (William Petersen) returned to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; to talk to bees, lecture about whale songs and tell of a flower whose fragrance can make anyone lose control. For a final time, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s offbeat brilliance brightened the forensics work.
As the influential CBS crime procedural ended its 15-year run &amp;#8212; SPOILER ALERT &amp;#8212; Grissom also stopped a mad bomber and found personal happiness. Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return was a reminder that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; had never been the same since Grissom left.</description>

Beyond being entranced by the newly sophisticated level of high-tech forensic investigation and the clever murder scenarios the show employed, fans also fell for the character&amp;rsquo;s personal dramas &amp;ndash; most specifically Grissom&amp;rsquo;s slow-simmering romance with Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s fellow investigator Sara Sidle.
&amp;ldquo;All we wanted to do was sort of have a real relationship that exists sometimes in the workplace where there&amp;rsquo;s a little thing that happens,&amp;rdquo; says Petersen. &amp;ldquo;And that becomes a little bit more of a thing.</description>

Sara Sidle &amp;ndash; CSI Forensic scientist Sara Sidle makes a living being up-close and personal with dead bodies, but she draws the line when it comes to animals. Sarah wasn&amp;rsquo;t always a vegetarian, instead she became one halfway through the show after spending a night with a dead, decomposing pig. Remarkably, Sara wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first vegetarian character played by actress Jorja Fox, who also gave up meat for Dr Maggie Doyle on E.</description>

Without giving too much away what is the most important bit of closure that you&amp;rsquo;ll offer your die-hard fans?
This is the Super Bowl for (Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s) Sara Sidle. She&amp;rsquo;s applied for the directorship of running the lab. This is the one incident that brings back Grissom, and we see her being mentored by (Ted Danson&amp;rsquo;s) D.B. Russell. This is a case that paralyzes Vegas. One of the big burning questions of the finale is where (Grissom&amp;rsquo;s) heart will lie.</description>

Not surprisingly, there was a &amp;lsquo;the gang&amp;rsquo;s all here&amp;rsquo; quality to the finale (and SPOILER ALERT if you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched), which concocted an excuse to bring back Grissom (Petersen) to work a case alongside Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and ex-wife Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), all in the ostensible service of solving a crime that tied into his past, involving the dominatrix Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke). Frankly, anyone who has watched TV in the last 20-some-odd years should have instantly known whodunit when Doug Hutchison (who has been playing a psycho as far back as Tombs in &amp;lsquo;The X-Files&amp;rsquo;) showed up, but that really wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue.</description>

Zuiker is staying pretty mum on the details of the finale, other than acknowledging that there is an explosion that &amp;ldquo;paralyzes Las Vegas&amp;rdquo; and hinting that the episode will deal with the resolution of Grissom&amp;rsquo;s relationships with both Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) and fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). In some ways, that feels ironic because of the show&amp;rsquo;s insistence early on, partially at Petersen&amp;rsquo;s behest, not to go home with its characters.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; wraps up its final case Sunday (Sept. 27), with a two-hour movie (CBS, 9 p.m.) that allows one of the most influential and successful shows in TV history to take a well-deserved final bow.
&amp;lsquo;If any show ever earned this kind of sendoff, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rsquo; CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler said this summer.
The last show, modestly titled &amp;lsquo;Immortality,&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t only let the CSI team save Las Vegas one final time.</description>

Fox, whose criminalist Sara Sidle renews contact with her ex, Grissom, says the finale resolves some relationship matters while characters solve a deadly mystery. “Anthony wrote a suspenseful, exhilarating, crazy, warped story, which is one of his specialties,” she says.

Questions of legacy were hardly at the forefront when CSI started. The series was a late addition to the network&amp;rsquo;s fall schedule and was initially scheduled on Fridays, a low-wattage night.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; was a last-minute pickup by CBS, plugged into a Friday lineup whose widely forecast surefire hit would be a reboot of &amp;ldquo;The Fugitive,&amp;rdquo; not a quirky little drama dwelling on hair fibers and blood spatter.
&amp;ldquo;I thought it was never going to succeed,&amp;rdquo; says Jorja Fox. At the time she had a recurring role on &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; as a Secret Service agent, &amp;ldquo;but I thought, &amp;lsquo;How fun would it be just to take this ride for a little while!</description>

When CSI prepares to wrap up its &amp;ldquo;historic and groundbreaking&amp;rdquo; CBS run on Sunday, many of the series&amp;rsquo;s favorites are returning, including charter cast members William Petersen as Gil Grissom and Marg Helgenberger as Catherine Willows, to join Ted Danson&amp;rsquo;s D.B. Russell for one last investigation.

It&amp;rsquo;s the end of an era: after 15 years on the air, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is coming to a close on Sept. 27 with a two-hour movie finale. The creators, producers, and cast met up on closing night of this year&amp;rsquo;s PaleyFest Fall TV Preview for a farewell salute panel on Wednesday (moderated by EW&amp;rsquo;s own Lynette Rice), and we caught up with William Petersen and some of his costars on the red carpet before the event to get their thoughts about the end of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>At the last event of this year&amp;rsquo;s PaleyFest Fall TV Previews at the Paley Center for Media, the cast and producers of CSI gathered Tuesday night in Los Angeles for a panel to say farewell to the groundbreaking series, which is ending its run after 15 seasons.
Though season 15 ended earlier this year, but the whole series is going out with a bang: It will conclude with a two-hour TV movie, which airs Sunday, Sept.</description>

      <description>After 15 years on the air, it&amp;rsquo;s time to say goodbye - but it&amp;rsquo;s all hands on deck for the final mystery.
As CSI comes to an end after 15 years, a new trailer has been unveiled for it&amp;rsquo;s movie-length finale Immortality.
The band is back together for what is bound to be an emotional final episode, with William Petersen, Jorja Fox, Paul Guilfoyle and Marg Helgenberger being brought back.</description>

      <description>The original cast members reflect on the highs and lows of starring in the CBS drama
After 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes, the crime drama will bid farewell with a two-hour finale on Sept. 27. We asked some original cast members to reflect on their time behind the yellow tape.
[&amp;hellip;]
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; (Sara Sidle): &amp;lsquo;I think Sara is the least-liked character on the show. As much as she has a lot of fans, I think she has more who dislike her.</description>

&amp;lsquo;Do you love him?&amp;rsquo; Lady Heather (guest-star Melinda Clarke) asks Sidle, to which Sidle tearfully replies, &amp;lsquo;I do.&amp;rsquo; That exchange, coupled with a shot of Sidle approaching Grissom on a boat, should offer suffering fans quite a bit of hope.</description>

      <description>Longtime faves William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Paul Guilfoyle, and Melinda Clarke returned to the CSI set earlier this month to help wrap 15 seasons and more than 300 episodes of the CBS drama with the two-hour finale (Sept. 27). Newer stars, including Ted Danson and Elisabeth Harnois, team with the vets to investigate a catastrophic event that paralyzes all of Sin City, but the two-parter &amp;#8212; titled &amp;ldquo;Immortality, Parts I and II&amp;rdquo; &amp;#8212; also was one last excuse to reunite old friends.</description>

      <description>After 15 years and countless cases, CSI closes the lab for good with a two-hour send-off.
THE MOST POPULAR, groundbreaking and influential whodunit in TV history has to go out with a bang, right? CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ends its 15-season run with &amp;ldquo;Immortality,&amp;rdquo; a two-hour episode about an explosive attack on the Eclipse, the posh Las Vegas casino co-owned by former CSI Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger). This news-making calamity has Catherine, now working for the FBI in Los Angeles, returning to Sin City to lead the forensics investigation.</description>

Disclaimer: Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s is not a typical success story. The CSI: Crime Scene Investigation staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt.</description>

      <description>It is hard to believe the &amp;ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; writers specifically meant for an episode surrounding panic around an Ebola-like virus to land on the schedule exactly when Ebola panic has permeated the US consciousness at yet to be matched levels of cable news attention. Even so, with multiple references to Ebola in the first fifteen minutes alone, the comparisons are too timely and specific to be a complete coincidence.</description>

At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what the promo for Sunday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo; would have us believe.

Is the wrong man on death row thanks to D.B. Russell? Season 15 has the CSI night-shift chief, played by Ted Danson, dealing with a crisis of conscience, and a threat to his career, when Las Vegas is rattled by a series of murders strikingly similar to those committed by the Gig Harbor Killer &amp;#8212; aka Jared Briscoe (Mark-Paul Gossalaar) &amp;#8212; a sicko Russell put behind bars years ago.</description>

      <description>Twenty years ago this week, a little hospital show called &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; debuted on NBC to much fanfare and managed to exceed the hype. For years, it was television&amp;rsquo;s #1 drama; it reinvented the television form, bringing a previously-unseen cinematic approach to shooting action in its Chicago hospital setting. And it had one of the deepest, craziest, most lovable ensembles in the history of television, both helped and eventually done in by its excessive longevity.</description>

Jorja Fox is really the antithesis of her television alter ego Sarah Sidle on the hit show CSI. Whereas Sidle is often sullen and dark, Fox is all smiles and has a bounce in her step that just makes you want to be around her.</description>

      <description>HOW DO YOU DEFINE BALANCED LIVING?
 JORJA FOX
VIVA COVER GIRL AND STAR OF CSI
Balance comes from the inside anbd I think it looks different for different people. What is balance for you and for me might be two different things. At the end of the day, if you are doing something you love, and if you can sleep at night, then that sets up a good equilibrium. An accomplishment and a restful night&amp;rsquo;s sleep help to keep me stable.</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;SHE plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle in one of most successful television dramas in history.&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
Yet actress Jorja Fox, who stars in CSI: Crime Scene Invesitgation, says how she first thought no-one would watch the show, which debuted in 2000.
&amp;ldquo;I have often thought of our show really as an action-adventure show &amp;ndash; you are going to be in for an amazing ride, an amazing hour of an exciting, dodgy, what&amp;rsquo;s-going-to-happen-next kind of ride.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;How does it feel to be on a show that&amp;rsquo;s clocked up over 300 episodes?&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing and it hit me today because I saw Jorja (co-star Jorja Fox) in the trailer getting ready and for her, she has been here for (over) 300 episodes. So to see the impact on her made me realise how powerful it was. You know, I&amp;rsquo;ve only done 33 episodes, so I have such a great deal of respect for all the people that have made this show so amazing to make it last this long.</description>

Her latest endeavor, Lion Ark, has been nominated for Outstanding International Motion Picture at this weekend&amp;rsquo;s 45th NAACP Image Awards.

The actress recently told People magazine that after losing her beloved dog, she didnt feel ready yet to welcome a new dog into her heart when she ended up rescuing a poodle mix named Bexar (the name is pronounced &amp;ldquo;bear&amp;rdquo;).&amp;ldquo;When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of 14 years. I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit and she did the same to me,&amp;rdquo; she said.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready to adopt a new dog. The &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; star was still mourning the loss of her old pet, who died in January, when a scruffy little mutt came into her life.
&amp;ldquo;When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of 14 years,&amp;rdquo; she reveals in an interview with Sweden with Love. Bexar (pronounded &amp;ldquo;bear&amp;rdquo;) had been found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly love at first sight.</description>

      <description>Actress** Jorja Fox** is standing in the middle of an airplane hangar in Boulder, Colorado, watching the doors of a Bolivian cargo jet open up. While the sun sets over the Rocky Mountains, individual crates housing twenty-five African lions are unloaded. Although from different prides, the lions share the same fate: rescued from circus abuse, they&amp;rsquo;re about to embark on a new life. All of a sudden, one lion after the other starts roaring, the sound bouncing off the walls in the giant hangar.</description>

      <description>Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s episode of CSI marks the CBS procedural&amp;rsquo;s 300th episode, and no matter how you slice it, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of murder.
[&amp;hellip;]
Realizing the show would reach the milestone this season, executive producer Don McGill says they wanted this entire season in general, and the 300th episode in particular, to look back at the show&amp;rsquo;s history. &amp;ldquo;When Carol and I talked about the season, [we thought,] &amp;#8216;Back to the beginning,&amp;lsquo;&amp;rdquo; McGill says.</description>

We asked the cast - including Marg Helgenberger, who reprises her role as Catherine Willows for Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s landmark 300th episode, which flashes back to a case the team failed to crack in 2000 - to reflect on the show&amp;rsquo;s best installments, selected by longtime executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</description>

      <description>The 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.
A cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.
The evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series.</description>

&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Is there any chance of Grissom popping up in CSI&amp;#8216;s 300th episode? &amp;ldquo;Selena&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;
&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;ADAM:&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo; In the flesh? Nah. But the episode, which flashes back to a 14-year-old case, does feature a full-circle shout-out to the man who started it all. &amp;ldquo;[The writers] pay a very sound and beautiful homage to [Grissom],&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox says. Speaking of Grissom, how is Sara handling the couple&amp;rsquo;s separation this season? &amp;ldquo;Sara is too young to sleep alone,&amp;rdquo; Fox says.</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox answer burning questions about Sara&amp;rsquo;s return and the crime show&amp;rsquo;s killer new season&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;
The most baffling crime on CSI last season wasn&amp;rsquo;t a stabbing or shooting. It was a missing persons case: The show&amp;rsquo;s lead investigator for its first nine seasons, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), left the series halfway through the year, sending CSI&amp;#8216;s ratings slipping and causing concern for its cast and producers.
&amp;ldquo;We look at last season in a way not dissimilar from the fans,&amp;rdquo; admits executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</description>

Looking at your filmography, you’ve been on a ton of great shows with some amazing actors, Reaper, House, Buffy. Was there an actor you worked with that really surprised you?
I’ve been so lucky that I just walked on set after set with just such welcoming actors, and that’s great because you hear horror stories. But I remember having to do a very emotional scene on CSI, and at the time, CSI was the #1 show, 30 million viewers each week, absurd numbers, you would think that if there was one set there would be big egos, it would be that set.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, is proud to be part of the planet&amp;rsquo;s favourite show
This week, the CSI team is spooked by a case that brings back memories of their murdered colleague, Warrick Brown. How does that store compare to the rest of this series?
This season is unique, because almost every episode impacts on one of the characters in a personal level. In an episode we shot recently, Sara&amp;rsquo;s ex-boyfriend comes to town, and she has to grapple with that.</description>

Question: I know you will probably give me your stock answer about &amp;ldquo;ships&amp;rdquo; and the realities of TV business, but don&amp;rsquo;t you think the break-up of Sara and Grissom on *CSI* was unusually cruel to the long suffering fans of this couple? I know William Petersen won&amp;rsquo;t be back on the show, but would it have been so bad to keep him off-screen like he has been, and let the writers keep their marriage safe and in the background?</description>

ADAM: Hopefully, this news will console you. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s over,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Don McGill tells us. &amp;ldquo;We felt the relationship had hit the true rocks and things were really at a breaking point. But they&amp;rsquo;re not divorced or even separated. They&amp;rsquo;re really just taking a very big time out.&amp;rdquo; More good news: The writers aren&amp;rsquo;t planning to throw Sara into any rebound flings and are actually hoping that this relationship hiccup might lure Grissom himself, William Petersen, back to the show.</description>

Darn it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be a TV fan these days, no? It seems like showrunners are just out to toy with our emotions and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was a perfect example tonight as a longstanding fan favorite couple took a (seemingly) one-way trip to splitsville. These are dark days, our friends!
[&amp;hellip;]
Couples Watch: In sad, sad TV couples news, CSI&amp;#8216;s Sara (Jorja Fox) and Grissom (William Petersen) are splitting up. After 13 years.</description>

      <description>There has always been a great divide amongst the fans of CSI, between those who love Grissom and Sara together and those who, I don’t know, hate romance and kick puppies for fun. Up until last night, the fans of GSR had pretty much won most of the battles in this cold war, but with “Forget Me Not,” this week’s episode, the other side landed a major, heart-breaking victory when Sara revealed that she and Grissom have separated.</description>

      <description>The February 20 episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; sees Sara (Jorja Fox) in hot water after a brief encounter with a man leaves her as the prime suspect in his murder case. Even worse &amp;#8212; her interaction with the victim has the team suspecting she&amp;rsquo;s cheating on Grissom (William Petersen).
In The Huffington Post&amp;rsquo;s exclusive clip from Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s Sara/Grissom-centric episode, Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) points out that as far as the rest of the team is concerned, if Sara cheated on her much-beloved husband, she &amp;ldquo;may as well have cheated on God.</description>

This season has put focus on Jorja Fox&amp;#8216;s Sara Sidle. Despite returning to the lab in Season Ten&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;[[Family Affair]]&amp;rdquo; after a relatively brief exit and marrying her former crime lab supervisor Gil Grissom (William Petersen), the long-distance arrangement for her marriage has taken a toll. &amp;ldquo;We are moving toward some understanding of where Sara is and where the strains are within the relationship,&amp;rdquo; a source close to the show tells CSI Files.</description>

In the CSI episode titled &amp;ldquo;Forget Me Not,&amp;rdquo; the long-distance &amp;#8212; and recently troubled &amp;#8212; marriage between Sara (Jorja Fox) and Gil (William Petersen, who was last seen on the show via a Skype conversation in 2011) will hit a major turning point. Divorce or reunion? Fox won&amp;rsquo;t spill, but she&amp;rsquo;s glad fans of the romance will get some resolution.</description>

How long have you been working on this show
About 7 years ago, I started to listen heavily to her music, watching videos and reading anything I could get my hands on. I wrote monologues in her voice and sang her songs at an open mic night at The Gardenia Club in West Hollywood. I won a screenwriting grant at University of Southern California and used that to get some musical charts in order and prototype a show.</description>

      <description>Santa visited &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans early this year, as we received the unexpected gift of a Sara-centered episode on &amp;ldquo;Risky Business Class.&amp;rdquo; It was based on a former colleague of Sara&amp;rsquo;s, Doug Wilson from the NTSB, asking for the help from the crime lab.
First, I&amp;rdquo;m thrilled that we got an episode that focused on this team member, specifically her marriage to Grissom. Many fans have wondered why there isn&amp;rsquo;t more mention of Grissom or why Sara doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to acknowledge that she&amp;rdquo;s even hitched.</description>

      <description>Now that all of my fellow GSR fans have breathed a collective sigh of relief, although it might be a bit premature, I can honestly say that &amp;lsquo;Risky Business Class,&amp;rsquo; this week&amp;rdquo;s episode of CSI, will only ever be memorable as the episode that clearly exposed the rift in Grissom and Sara&amp;rdquo;s marriage.
There have been signs that the long distance arrangement is wearing on her all season, but it usually takes something big to make us wake up and realize there&amp;rdquo;s a problem in our lives, and for Sara it took the appearance of Doug Wilson, an NSTB investigator and former fling from San Francisco, who arrived in Vegas to investigate the crash of a small charter plane just off the Strip.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a fine line to ride when doing interviews with folks from the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation franchise. Obviously, I am a huge fan of the shows (otherwise I would not be here), so there’s always a bit of excitement and nostalgia when doing promotional material. But there’s always a reminder in the back of my head that CSI Files is a very professional outlet, and I have to be somewhat on guard as to how ‘geeky’ I get.</description>

      <description>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation is preparing for some heavy character development in the second stretch of Season Thirteen.
Sources close to the show tell CSI Files exclusively that Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), Nick Stokes (George Eads), and Morgan Brody (Elisabeth Harnois) will be dealing with some significant character development during the remainder of this season, and also potentially set the stage for a visit from returning characters.&amp;lsquo;We want to more completely address the issue of Sara and Grissom; the challenge of that for her, certainly,&amp;rsquo; one source tells CSI Files.</description>

CSI Files: Who of the original team is most affected by this episode?
Mularz: I&amp;rdquo;d say Nick and Sara. Nick and Sara, I feel like, take it the hardest. Brass has a really nice moment where he talks about how he actually hasn&amp;rdquo;t been to the cemetery since Warrick&amp;rdquo;s funeral, but he has his own ways of remembering him. Brass likes to think about how much energy Warrick had. He says a little piece about Fight Nights, those are the nights that he thinks of Warrick.</description>

From time to time, the music we play and with all the noise, we&amp;rdquo;d have to take a break from shooting. For example, they played Queen&amp;rdquo;s &amp;lsquo;We will rock you&amp;rsquo;, and the crowd got into it, dancing and waving their hands. Meanwhile, the crew and cast would walk around and record video of everyone. On another one of these breaks, Jorja Fox did an impressive little dance in a little hidden space behind video village.</description>

After playing this one character for over twelve seasons, she knows the ins and outs of her character to a T, and is always eager to add new layers and nuances to her performance.</description>

Barbour: Yes. There was purpose to the fact that they&amp;rdquo;re in different places in their lives and yet it was very poignant for Sara and Nick to get into it.</description>

What should fans look forward to next season? And if you haven&amp;rdquo;t gotten that far yetâ¦what would your dream season be?
We start with our &amp;lsquo;Cape Fear&amp;rsquo;-style premiere, putting Russell and the team on the line. A villain from the past, former Under Sheriff Jeff McKeen (Conor O&amp;rdquo;Farrell), who took the life of CSI Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), is now out to get all of our CSIs. Also in the works is a mass killing at a favorite haunt of the lab rats.</description>

In general,Â *CSI*Â has become a richer series. It&amp;rdquo;s minimized the crazy-Vegas murder scenarios that were beginning to undermine minimal believability, and I&amp;rdquo;d say that even if you wish that, say, Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;s Sara had more of a role in the show these days, that reflects the way things happen in any given workplace â some veterans tend to recede into the background, content to do their jobs well, while new faces (Shue&amp;rdquo;s Finn, in this case) come on like gangbusters, eager (or neurotic, or insecure, or all of the above) to prove themselves.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rdquo;s &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; is taking on circus animal abusers in a new PSA for Animal Defenders International (ADI). The PSA is only 90 seconds long but the impact of the video is strong. The scenes flip from free roaming wild elephants in Africa to a traveling circus elephant named Krissy that is chained, beaten, and broken for the entertainment of humans.
Fox appears in the PSA holding a bullhook with a very solemn expression on her face.</description>

Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) April 19, 2012
Actress Jorja Fox (who plays CSI&amp;rdquo;s Sarah Sidle) released a new video message about circus animal abuse today, on behalf of Animal Defenders International (ADI). Fox is seen holding a bullhook, a weapon used to control elephants saying, &amp;lsquo;This is a bullhook it&amp;rdquo;s heavy, it&amp;rdquo;s sharp, and it hurts,&amp;rsquo; she continues, &amp;lsquo;This is the weapon of choice for elephant circus performers.</description>

CSI Files: George Eads spoke with me about how he&amp;rdquo;d like to see a bit of a relationship between Nick and Finn.
Shue: Nice, I like that! That would be fun; I think that would be great. They probably don&amp;rdquo;t like the characters on CSI to get too intimateâ¦ I don&amp;rdquo;t know why, but I don&amp;rdquo;t think they&amp;rdquo;ve ever&amp;ndash;except for Jorja [Fox, Sara Sidle] and Billy Petersen&amp;rdquo;s [Gil Grissom] character.</description>

      <description>Tonight, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Marg Helgenberger&amp;rdquo;s&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; run as sexy, smart, and sassy crime scene investigator Catherine Willows will reach its conclusion. A twelve year tenure with more than 250 episodes under her belt, the actress has decided to pursue other opportunities and is bound for more success, whether it be a Broadway show or returning to film. Though her departure will surely bring tears to the show&amp;rdquo;s audience, the cast and crew of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation are looking on the bright side, reflecting back at their time on the show with the universally adored actress.</description>

Jorja Fox had written this card for me with a polar bear on it â a photograph of a polar bear. What she said in the card was so beautiful about how I&amp;rdquo;m an endangered species and blah, blah, blah. It was just so moving. So I just feel so blessed to have had this experience all these years.

TV Guide Magazine: So was your last day like a celebration or a wake?
Helgenberger: [Laughs] To be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well those first couple days afterward. It was a tearful exit from the set, then I went out with a few close friends like Eric [Szmanda], [Robert] David [Hall] and Jorja [Fox]. It&amp;rsquo;s never a good idea to start drinking tequila at 10:30 at night, but it was a perfect way to end things.</description>

On Dec. 7, the 53-year-old actress became the third original star (behind Gary Dourdan and William Petersen) to depart the long-running crime drama. All of her current costars &amp;#8212; Ted Danson (D.B. Russel), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), and Paul Guilfoyle (Capt. Jim Brass) among them &amp;#8212; were there to appear in Helgenberger&amp;rsquo;s final scene and to bid farewell to the unofficial den mom of the franchise.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a joke almost as old as show business itself. The aging actor - or, the more common stereotype, actress - who insists they can play characters decades younger than they are.
In our modern information age, though, it&amp;rsquo;s no laughing matter.
In October, an actress filed suit against Amazon and its subsidiary, the Internet Movie Database, for posting her birth date on the latter website.
The world&amp;rsquo;s most comprehensive repository of information about films, television shows and just about everybody who&amp;rsquo;s ever worked on them, IMDb has become the standard reference for not only journalists and fans, but increasingly for folks in the industry who want to check out potential hires.</description>

      <description>WASHINGTON (AP) &amp;#8212; There&amp;rsquo;s a feeling of dread on the set of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and it has nothing to do with a murder. Jorja Fox says they&amp;rsquo;re starting to shoot the episodes leading up to Marg Helgenberger&amp;rsquo;s departure after 12 years. She says they&amp;rsquo;ve been on &amp;ldquo;this really fun high&amp;rdquo; since Ted Danson joined the show, but now, they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;about to be devastated.&amp;rdquo; She says it&amp;rsquo;s getting &amp;ldquo;pretty emotional&amp;rdquo; on the set.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox spends her days investigating crimes on the TV show &amp;lsquo;CSI.&amp;rsquo; Now, she&amp;rsquo;s asking the public to do some investigating of their own. Not hair remnants or clothing fibers, but the way 10 billion farm animals are raised for food annually in the USA. She wants you to explore vegetarianism.
The actress debuted her new PETA ad at the vegan restaurant Sublime, and even helped with the cooking. They prepared spicy Singapore street noodles, &amp;ldquo;chicken picatta, and gourmet pizzas.</description>

So does Jorja Fox. If she could write her own episode, she&amp;rsquo;d want to &amp;ldquo;look at her love affair more closely.&amp;rdquo; She says &amp;ldquo;it would be amazing if she traveled somewhere kind of exotic to see Grissom and see what he&amp;rsquo;s doing.&amp;rdquo; She says Sara may be happily married, but &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s really lonely.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox thinks that everyone should play detective and investigate how animals are killed for food. Jorja unveiled her pro-vegetarian PETA ad to an enthusiastic crowd Sunday at Fort Lauderdale&amp;rsquo;s gourmet vegan restaurant, Sublime.
She even got things cooking in the kitchen, helping the chefs with the evening&amp;rsquo;s delicious cruelty-free feast.
Jorja went vegetarian years agoâhalfway through a sandwich. &amp;ldquo;I was having a meatball sub one day in Brooklyn, and it just clicked,&amp;rdquo; she explains.</description>

      <description>Animal activists and celebrities launched a new effort Wednesday to protect exotic animals by taking the &amp;ldquo;traveling&amp;rdquo; out of traveling circuses.
The proposed federal legislation would place sharp limits on the ability to transport lions, tigers and elephants around the country. Circuses say it would essentially shut down the animal portion of their shows.
Representatives from L.A.-based Animal Defenders International and Northern California&amp;rsquo;s Performing Animal Welfare Society, along with critter-friendly celebrities Bob Barker and Jorja Fox, held a press conference in Washington, D.</description>

At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty.

Below you can find a transcript of the entire chat.

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it, but I think I am starting to actually &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; D.B. Russell. Granted, the show&amp;rsquo;s new lead (played by Ted Danson) had a very good supporting story this episode, continuing the trend of the crimes getting more interesting, which is something the show hasn&amp;rsquo;t done for some time.
Two different scenes took the forefront this week. Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) and Greg (Eric Szmanda) followed a man found dead on the streets, his lungs full of chocolate.</description>

The Sara Sidle actress has nothing but high energy and enthusiasm just hours before the season premiere, and could not be more thrilled about the show&amp;rsquo;s twelfth season. CSI Files&amp;rsquo; Shane Saunders caught up with Fox to talk about her presence on the show this season, working with new cast members, a fellow co-star&amp;rsquo;s pending departure, and much more in this exclusive interview.</description>

      <description>Ted Danson has built up a lot of goodwill among audiences after appearing on such hits as &amp;ldquo;Cheers,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Damages,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Becker.&amp;rdquo; But that goodwill might not extend to his new costars on &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo;
[..]
Is it possible that, in his zeal to help save the show from cancellation, Ted Danson is rubbing some castmates the wrong way? Sure. A lot of the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cast has been on the show from the beginning and probably have their own ways of working together.</description>

**CSI - ** Given the news that the upcoming season is very likely Marg Helgenberger&amp;rsquo;s last, it&amp;rsquo;d stand to reason that William Petersen might put in an encore, playing Gil to her Catherine. But as of Wednesday, when I spoke to show boss Carol Mendelsohn, nothing yet seemed set in stone. &amp;ldquo;Listen, every year we go to Billy &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s sort of like a pilgrimage &amp;ndash; to say, &amp;lsquo;Will you come back?</description>

      <description>The merry-go-round that is Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s status on the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has changed once again &amp;#8212; but this time the news is good.
Fox, who has been a guest star for the last four years, is returning to the show this fall as a series regular (as reported by TV Line). The actress was briefly fired from her role as CSI investigator Sara Sidle back in 2004 for failing to report to work (along with her co-star George Eads) during a contract dispute.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox is returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; as a series regular in the fall.
The actress was a series regular for the first seven seasons, playing tenacious forensic scientist Sara Sidle. Fox left at the beginning of Season 8 and returned only as a guest star the following seasons. But now she&amp;rsquo;s coming back to Clark County for good, TV Line reported.
Fox will be starring alongside Ted Danson, who recently replaced outgoing Laurence Fishburne as head of the investigation team for the procedural during the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s 12th-season shakeup.</description>

      <description>When she was abducted and buried alive, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s head spun. If he needed to kill someone to find her, he would have. When she left for good Grissom felt like his whole world fell apart &amp;ndash; no he felt like dying was a better punishment for his inability to set aside his career for his relationship with her.
Well, Sara Sidle is back. Unfortunately Grissom (played by William Petersen) will not be.</description>

      <description>It appears that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s on-again, off-again relationship with the long-running CBS hit &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is on again. And this time it&amp;rsquo;s permanent &amp;hellip; for now.
The actress who plays crime scene investigator Sara Sidle has signed on as a series regular after four seasons as a guest star, according to a report from TV Line.
Fox has disappeared and re-appeared from the show seemingly as many times as the Miniature Killer that almost took the life of Fox&amp;rsquo;s character.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox returned to CSI, and considering her long history with the CBS crime procedural and the huge popularity of character Sara Sidle, you&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking the actress was already a series regular. Not so, TV Line revealed this week, as Fox has only just been promoted to regular status, coinciding with the start of CSI&amp;rsquo;s twelfth season this fall.
Fox, 43, used to be a series regular during the first seven seasons of CSI; however, she left the show at the start of Season 8.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s on-again. off-again relationship with &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; flipped to on-again, as CBS announced she will return to the series as a regular this fall.
After seven seasons as a regular &amp;ndash; and several contract disputes &amp;ndash; Jorja left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, but she and her character, Sara Sidle, soon returned to the show as a recurring guest star for the next four seasons.
It&amp;rsquo;s the second major cast change for &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; which announced last week that Ted Danson would join the cast, replacing Laurence Fishburne.</description>

How it was the experience working in a chapter of a prime time TV show CSI with Academy Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin or TV stars like Jorja Fox?
It was truly wonderful. Marlee is a genius, I was so jealous watching her work. Because it was a deaf themed episode (The Two Mrs. Grissoms) we had tons of deaf actors, including Phyllis Frelich, who won the Tony for the same role, Marlee won the Oscar (Sarah in &amp;ldquo;Children of a Lesser God&amp;rdquo;, Phyllis on Broadway and Marlee in the film).</description>

Indeed, if Langston&amp;rsquo;s obsession with Haskell leads to murder, Langston&amp;rsquo;s career could be in jeopardy. Also at stake: the entire team&amp;rsquo;s reputation.
&amp;ldquo;If [Langston] goes to the darker side, where does the team stand in all of that? Do they have his back?&amp;rdquo; Mendelsohn says.

Lady Heather is now a sex therapist &amp;ndash; professional name: Dr. Heather Kessler â and she was visited by Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s Ray Langston and Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara for background on a kinky case they were investigating about a dead girl who had acted out her neuroses as a kitty cat.</description>

Of course, we already knew that Haskell&amp;rsquo;s season-ending reappearance is right around the corner, but here&amp;rsquo;s the twist: It&amp;rsquo;s Clarke&amp;rsquo;s sixth CSI guest spot that actually kick-starts this intense, killer arc.</description>

      <description>(CNN) &amp;#8212; Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains.
Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its &amp;ldquo;Operation Lion Ark.&amp;rdquo;
The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses.</description>

      <description>DENVER &amp;#8212; More than two dozen Bolivian circus lions were getting accustomed to their new surroundings at The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Keenesburg, Colo., Thursday.
They arrived at their new permanent home on 80 acres of open space Wednesday evening, after a long flight from Bolivia to Denver.

      <description>DENVER â international airport U.S. agriculture and customs officials have completed their inspection and now crates carrying 25 lions rescued from small traveling circuses in Bolivia are being unloaded.
The animals, ferried to Colorado by Animal Defenders International&amp;rsquo;s Operation Lion Ark, are en route to the Wild Animal Sanctuary near Keensburg.
About 100 ADI and sanctuary volunteers, media and law enforcement officials met the Bolivian cargo plane at United Airlines&amp;rsquo; maintenance hangar at the north end of Denver International Airport.</description>

      <description>Twenty-five lions, most of them rescued from Bolivian circuses, are heading to Colorado to start their new lives at a wildlife sanctuary.
The 13 males and 12 females were scheduled to land at Denver International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.
Animal Defenders International say the lions were rescued from deplorable conditions after a law was passed last year in Bolivia prohibiting performances that involve animals.
Television personality Bob Barker financed the rescue.</description>

      <description>It was a reunion of sorts, when after almost two years of absence, Gil Grissom [William Petersen] appeared on the February 3 episode of CSI, titled &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We had the perfect story&amp;rdquo;, says ex. producer Carol Mendelsohn tells TV Guide Magazine about the timing of Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return, &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms&amp;rdquo; in conflict, and the peacemaker was MIA. &amp;ldquo;In fact, it was Grissom&amp;rsquo;s on-screen wife, Jorja Fox, who reached out to Petersen and convinced him to do a cameo with her and guest star Phyllis Frelich, who played his mom.</description>

Story:
While attending a scholarship benefit party for the hearing impaired with Gil&amp;rsquo;s mother Betty (Phyllis Frelich), Sara (Jorja Fox) is first on the scene when a car bomb goes off. The man inside is Dr. Eric Lambert (Anthony Natale), a colleague of Prof. Julia Holden (Marlee Matlin), who we later learn is Gil&amp;rsquo;s ex.
After learning that Julia, who was at the scene when the car was discovered, lied about her whereabouts at the time of the explosion, Sara puts her in the crosshairs as the prime suspect.</description>

      <description>As implicitly promised in all the teases leading up to the show, Thursday&amp;rsquo;s (Feb. 3) episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; featured the return of the show&amp;rsquo;s original lead character, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) &amp;#8212; at least for a couple minutes.
It was not, however, a particularly splashy comeback. Grissom appeared only at the end of the episode (the scene is above) to chat with his wife, Sara (Jorja Fox) and mom (guest star Phyllis Frelich), via video conference.</description>

      <description>Now here&amp;rsquo;s a love letter to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; devotees: EW has learned exclusively that William Petersen will reprise his role as Gil Grissom with a cameo in an upcoming episode. The actor &amp;ndash; who left the show in January 2009 &amp;ndash; already shot his appearance on the CBS drama and we&amp;rsquo;re told his return involves Jorja Fox, who plays Gil&amp;rsquo;s on-screen wife Sara. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear exactly when he&amp;rsquo;ll appear back in or around the lab, but TV Line teased that it may occur this week.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been confirmed: William Petersen will make a cameo as Gil Grissom on CSI this season. The only question remaining: might this take place as early as Thursday?
Sources tell Entertainment Weekly that the actor - who departed the drama a year ago &amp;ndash; has already shot his upcoming scene, which will involve Grissom&amp;rsquo;s on-screen wife, Sara.
Considering the storyline of &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms,&amp;rdquo; which will feature Gil&amp;rsquo;s mother and ex-girlfriend, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the appearances goes down this week.</description>

      <description>Something tells me Sara/Grissom fans will not want to miss next week&amp;rsquo;s CSI.
The following promotional clip from the Feb. 3 episode â which finds Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara working through some issues with her disapproving mother-in-law â strongly suggests that William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s MIA Grissom will figure into the family squabble.
But will William Petersen actually be making an appearance â as CSI Files is reporting? Or will Grissom remain an off screen presence?</description>

      <description>As hard-core fans of CBS&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; know, former CSI boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen) had deaf parents and therefore is adept at American Sign Language. They also know he married fellow CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and is in the jungle doing research, while Sara is back in Las Vegas working crime scenes.
But what they probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that Grissom had another woman in his past, something that Sara discovers in a rather uncomfortable way.</description>

Whether you were a Georgia Bulldogs basketball booster in the first place or have become more enthusiastic in your support of the sport as a result of the Hoop Hounds&amp;rsquo; recent success, you doubtless have discovered that there is a lot to like about Coach Fox. Since there is little sense in comparing him to past Georgia basketball coaches&amp;#8212;that would be to damn him with faint praise, indeed&amp;#8212;the only other way to evaluate him is, of course, to compare him to other Foxes.</description>

      <description>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation fans breathed a sign of relief when Jorja Fox returned this season as criminologist Sara Sidle. More gregarious than her on-screen character, the veg actress applies her equally sharp mind and big heart in real life to activism on behalf of animals. She&amp;rsquo;s an executive producer of the upcoming documentary How I Became an Elephant, which follows a 14-year-old girl on her mission to save the planet&amp;rsquo;s gentle giants.</description>

Answer&amp;hellip;.&amp;ldquo;Sadly, no. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re bugged by it,&amp;rdquo; admits exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;Gil is the legacy of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. You can never say he&amp;rsquo;s the one who shall not be named.

Ainav in Israel: I found a piece of information on the web that episode 11.13 of CSI is called &amp;ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms&amp;rdquo;! Now I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much for CSI anymore, but if that&amp;rsquo;s true then I care a whole lot!
It&amp;rsquo;s true! The Mrs. Grissoms in question are Sarah Sidle (the current Mrs. Grissom)&amp;hellip;and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s mom! Producers are casting now for the older Mrs. Grissom, who is described as a &amp;ldquo;strong, confident, intelligent and influential woman has never allowed her lack of hearing to keep her from doing anything she wanted, and has no trouble making her feelings known to one and all.</description>

After weeks of sharks in pools, vampires taking on werewolves, and a gimpy serial killers wearing pleather suits, I was almost certain the show&amp;rsquo;s handling of this psychological ailment of the moment would be serve as nothing but shock value.

- &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; premiere thoughts: Man, where to freaking begin?Â Okay, first the good stuff. Larry Fishburne enters his third season on the show with some goddamn attitude, something his Dr. Raymond Langston character has been missing since he started in 2008, and it&amp;rsquo;s been great. Langston, still hurt from the prison attack that ended last season, walks around with a cane and a sneer, like he&amp;rsquo;s telling the world &amp;ldquo;I am through with you all fucking with me!</description>

As one of the token vegetarians around the TV Squad offices, I know all about the hardships of choosing to remain meat-free. But hey, I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. I&amp;rsquo;ve got millions of other vegetarian and vegan brethren &amp;#8212; even fictional ones!
In honor of this joyous holiday, I&amp;rsquo;m grilling up some tofu and paying respect to some of TV&amp;rsquo;s best vegetarians.</description>

      <description>Actress Jorja Fox may play a forensic scientist on CSI, but her real-life role is playing the part of mom to her 13-year-old boxer, Ali. &amp;ldquo;She was a rescue, and a friend of mine was desperately trying to find her a home,&amp;rdquo; Fox told PEOPLEPets.com last week at the Taste of Beverly Hills. After taking her in, &amp;ldquo;I had her only two or three weeks when I realized, &amp;#8216;This is probably the best decision I ever made.</description>

*CSI*&amp;#8216;s Jorja Fox says she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure to re-sign
Asked by the weekly French magazine Tele Star, Jorja Fox talked about the season 11 of CSI. She re-signed for 11 episodes and will see in early 2011 if she wants to do more. Making only a few episodes works for her.
She wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about returning to the show.</description>

Jorja Fox: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m returning for eleven episodes. I&amp;rsquo;ll decide January if I want to continue.</description>

      <description>Late at night in San Francisco Airport; two transport trucks waiting; film and camera crews at the ready; ADI Ambassador Jorja Fox and the ADI Rescue Team on hand with supplies of water; one of the runways was about to play host to a contingent of lions flying in from Bolivia.
As the aircraft touched down, the level of excitement hit fever pitch: after months of negotiations, the four lions had finally made it: Camba, Simba, Bambek and Dactari were going to a new home.</description>

      <description>Some TV couples just have a certain spark. It makes them intriguing to watch as an audience, and their will-they-or-won&amp;rsquo;t-they plotlines and ups and downs create fan bases. Here is a list of the top ten TV couples.
[&amp;hellip;]
 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) &amp;ndash; CSI  This was handled in a different way. There were always hints that Sara and Grissom had a relationship prior to their time at CSI, and then it was suddenly revealed that they had been dating &amp;ndash; for years &amp;ndash; during the time period of the show.</description>

Plus, hearing that Marg Helgenberger has decided to end her long run as Catherine Willows this season, Mendelsohn says she plans to &amp;ldquo;start begging on my knees as the season progresses.</description>

**Question: **Just read that Jorja Fox is returning as Sara Sidle on CSI, though it is not known yet whether she&amp;rsquo;d come back as a recurring star, as she has been since her initial &amp;ldquo;return,&amp;rdquo; or as a regular cast member. Though I was happy to read the news &amp;mdash; I think the show is better when Fox is on it &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;d be happy if she does a recurring role because then she&amp;rsquo;d still be Sara Sidle Grissom, but if it&amp;rsquo;s as a regular, I would think her tie with Gil would have to be eliminated, and I&amp;rsquo;ve rather liked the mentions because I still think the show lost a lot when Grissom (William Petersen) left.</description>

      <description>**Q. **I guess I missed an episode, because I have no idea why Sara (played by Jorja Fox) is back on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo; The last I saw, she quit and went to live in the jungle, followed shortly by Grissom. Later, she made a statement about her husband being in Paris. Could you please clear up this puzzle?
- Sandra Robson,
Port St. Lucie, Fla.
A. The CBS show wrote Sara out during season eight, and she bowed out by leaving Grissom (William Petersen) a letter explaining that she had to go away to deal with personal demons.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Philippe offered his unique insight into the disaster and suggested ways for members of the entertainment community to assist with the recovery efforts,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Ross, executive director of the Artists and Athletes Alliance.</description>

At another Hollywood party, I recognised Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle in CSI. Buoyed by my earlier success with Liv Tyler, and fortified by several beers, I loitered with intent, waiting for the right time to introduce myself.
It is possible that I appeared to be a wild-eyed, leering madman. Apparently sensing that I was standing a little too close to be innocently passing by, Jorja stood up and, well &amp;hellip; ran away from me.</description>

      <description>This just in: Jorja Fox (Sara) has renewed her commitment to CSI.
Sources confirm to me exclusively that Fox has signed on to return for the procedural’s upcoming 11th season. Terms of her new contract are being kept under wraps, so it’s unclear whether she’ll be billed as a recurring guest star or a series regular.
CBS declined to comment.
Fox was one of five CSI vets negotiating new pacts with the show &amp;ndash; and the last to sign on the dotted line.</description>

**Question: I would ask if you knew if Jorja Fox was going to re-sign with CSI, but the chances of getting an answer are slim to none, right? &amp;#8212; ALS
Ausiello: Slim to none &amp;hellip; yes and no.

And to boost the plots, comes back an old member : Sara Sidle, gone from the show since the beginning of the season 8. Officially, Jorja Fox left CSI in 2007 to do others projects. Unofficially, the 41 year old actress, tired of playing second fiddle, left after the production refused to increase her salary. Obviously, they came back with better propositions
Called to the rescue for a few episodes during season 9, Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s character becomes a regular during season 10.</description>

      <description>After a four year break, Jorja&amp;rsquo;s returning to the hit crime drama series CSI and MSN Entertainment has got the latest on her character, Sara Sidle and what&amp;rsquo;s up and coming for Season 10 of CSI.
Q: Tell us what is it like leaving CSI and then coming back again after a break?
A: Well when I was on CSI, I was really exhausted and literally crying. I said to the executive producer when I left that I would love to visit sometime.</description>

      <description>Welcome home, Jorja Fox. Even as we longed for her return as Sara Sidle (a.k.a. Mrs Gil Grissom) on CSI, Fox said she had been missing her onscreen persona, her cast-mates and the show terribly.
So much that she had to restrain herself from tuning in.
&amp;hellip;I stopped watching* CSI* because I figured the sadness would go away if I don&amp;rsquo;t watch it,&amp;rdquo; the 48-year-old actress said in a recorded interview.</description>

      <description>WHEN she announced that she was taking a break from acting three years ago, CSI fans flew planes over the Universal Studios film sets in California in protest.
But the banners they used, which read &amp;#8216;Keep Jorja Fox on CBS&amp;rsquo;, can now be kept away.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Jorja Fox, 42, will reprise her role as tough cookie forensic scientist Sarah Sidle on hit crime series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;s 10th season.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Question: I&amp;rsquo;ve been a *CSI *(Las Vegas) fan from the beginning. But this season has just lost me. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why Sara is back while Grissom is off in Paris? I thought their love story ended beautifully in the jungle. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;happy Sara&amp;rdquo; either. It just seems too OOC (out of character) for me. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about the Dr. Jekyll storyline the way I did with the miniature killer, blue-paint killer or the Paul Millander story.</description>

      <description>Fasten your seat belt-&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is going on a furious ride. On Feb. 4, the team is called in to investigate a death at a high school. &amp;ldquo;It starts with a kid whose brain literally explodes, and that leads us into the world of classic cars, hot rods and organized street racing&amp;rdquo;, says exec. producer Naren Shankar. And after a lot of is-she-or-isn&amp;rsquo;t-she staying, Jorja Fox ends the speculation and rejoins &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; full-time.</description>

      <description>Lists inspire debate and remind us of our favorite people and events. Oh, and there&amp;rsquo;s one other cool thing about lists: they give us an excuse to drool over dozens of the sexiest women in television.
Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s only true if you happen to be doing a list like, say, The 50 Hottest Girls on Television; it won&amp;rsquo;t work if it&amp;rsquo;s a list of Best Carburetors. Luckily, our list actually is about sexy women, complete with photos of these ladies in all their slobber-inducing splendor.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I love the idea of returning as an &amp;ldquo;invitee&amp;rdquo; to CSI&amp;ldquo;
In the United States, she has just returned to the series. Between Jorja Fox and CSI, it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat I love you &amp;hellip; me neither. The 41-year-old actress who plays Sara Sidle welcomes the return to her uniform. Even if her character has changed, including a marriage!

      <description>This Thursday night (November 19) on CBS at 9pm, one of the most-watched shows on television, CSI (the original version, set in Las Vegas), will air a bowling-themed episode titled &amp;ldquo;Lover&amp;rsquo;s Lane&amp;rdquo; (watch the 30-second promo below) on which yours truly had the pleasure of working as a bowling consultant.
[&amp;hellip;]
As I made my way through the various set-pieces, word of my arrival must have somehow percolated through the building, as everywhere I went I overheard various actors and crew members giddily discussing bowling.</description>

      <description>CBS couldn&amp;rsquo;t please their millions of fans more. Jorja Fox is back on CSI. Gone from Las Vegas since season 8, Sara Sidle is back ever since the first episode of season 10, currently airing in the US. There are many reasons to rejoice. TÃTUE.COM will tell you why.
Hallelujah! After two years absence, Jorja Fox is back on CSI. Thanks to her, the &amp;ldquo;butchest&amp;rdquo; of the CSI girls, Sara Sidle, is back in Vegas in Season 10.</description>

      <description>The latest puzzler for the &amp;#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;: How to stop a ratings slide that began with William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s departure last season and has continued into a new season, during which the granddaddy of forensic procedural dramas has lost its crown as TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated scripted series to &amp;#8216;NCIS&amp;rsquo;? Answer? Stunts, starting with extending Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the show from temporary (five episodes) to indefinite.
Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s Ausiello Files reports that &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; producers want to keep Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle around as long as they can.</description>

      <description>I think we all saw this coming, right? The return of Sara Sidle (uhh, Grissom) cannot be just for five episodes this season. Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the current season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; will be indefinite, which means we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of her than we initially thought this season.
&amp;ldquo;This season is about bringing the family back together again,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told Entertainment Weekly&amp;#8216;s Michael Ausiello.</description>

Ausiello: They were just together, albeit off screen. As exec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells me, Sara will reveal in this week’s episode that she “just got back from visiting Grissom in Paris.” Mendelsohn adds that, “We have no plans for Billy to return at the moment, but the door’s always open.</description>

      <description>This long-distance marriage thing seems to be working for Grissom and Sara on CSI. Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms to me exclusively that Jorja Fox’s five-episode comeback has been extended indefinitely.
“We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja,” says Mendelsohn. “The season is about bringing the [CSI] family back together again, so [this] was just a natural. Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.</description>

Jorja Fox, who we will soon see back on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; guest stars as housewife in jail in desperate need of legal services on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; (Sunday, Lifetime, 9 p.m.). Do you remember a few years ago, when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; acted like they didn&amp;rsquo;t need Jorja Fox or George Eads and that basically the cast was replaceable a la &amp;ldquo;Law &amp;amp; Order?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that this hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out to be the case.</description>

Question: I went to bed Thursday night thinking, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to ask Matt what he thinks of [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/ CSI],&amp;rsquo; and then Friday I saw there was a CSI [http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/csi/sara-is-back-2548.html recap] by Neil Turitz and found it SO RIGHT ON that I commented right away. I&amp;rsquo;d always loved the show and had high hopes for it after Gil left, thinking Laurence Fishburne would bring something different to the mix and the rest of the wonderful cast was still there (Sara had left already) so I gave it my all but it didn&amp;rsquo;t give back.</description>

[&amp;hellip;]
You know how sometimes I have to remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m only watching a TV show and the characters aren&amp;rsquo;t real? That&amp;rsquo;s EXACTLY how I felt when we found out Sara and Grissom are married on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.). I was so happy that those two crazy kids had finally found a way to make it work.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Trifecta: &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;CSI: NY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;
The mothership clearly had the strongest opening, with that stellar freeze-frame shot that traveled all through the lab, water droplets floating in the air, bullets rippling by. It was visually arresting, almost like a comic book come to life. So some actress died. The sad thing about being a procedural fan is that there are so many things you&amp;rsquo;re hip to, that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;ndash;like the fact that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cast Cromatie (Garret Dillahunt) from Sarah Conner unless he was doing some dirty.</description>

[&amp;hellip;]
Sorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they&amp;rsquo;ve opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She&amp;rsquo;s badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris.</description>

      <description>I found out Jorja Fox was a KCRW fan when I spotted her at an event we put on earlier this year called RadioActive. She looked like all the other music lovers, ready to get her groove on! The actress is perhaps best known for her work in the hit CBS crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, as well as roles on ER and The West Wing, but her love of music is clearly a major part of her life.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like one of those long, cool, signature &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; tracking shots, but the one that opened the new season last night was a little longer and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, a lot cooler than the norm. We would even go so far as to call the shot &amp;ndash; which showed the entire team in freeze frame even though they were clearly in the middle of some kind of gun battle &amp;ndash; downright nifty.</description>

Most Special Effect: The elaborate opening shot of CSI&amp;#8216;s opening episode was as dazzling as promised: a freeze-frame tableau of the lab&amp;rsquo;s violent invasion by gun-toting Russian mobsters. Shards of broken glass, blood spatter, bullet trajectories, gunshot flares, and bodies in various modes of action-hero motion, all frozen in a 3D-like tapestry of chaos. The episode that followed wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, either, and Jorja Fox is welcome back anytime, although we&amp;rsquo;re sorry we missed Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s wedding.</description>

      <description>The way I see it, it&amp;rsquo;s as if Sara Sidle never really left.
I mean, she left in the eighth, showed up on the ninth, and is sort of returning to the team for the tenth, which starts tonight, right? Then again, there are a lot of questions now that Sara&amp;rsquo;s back on CSI. You know, stuff about her reasons for her return, or what she&amp;rsquo;s been up to in between her first departure, her Costa Rican gig, and her return.</description>

      <description>The tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; kicks off Thursday night and the season premiere marks the return of Sara Sidle. Sara comes back to help out the lab which is understaffed.
&amp;ldquo;It feels amazing to be back. It feels wonderful,&amp;rdquo; exclaimed Jorja Fox who plays Sara. Her fellow cast mates agree.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited,&amp;rdquo; said Marg Helgenberger who plays Catherine. &amp;ldquo;I love Jorja and I&amp;rsquo;ve missed her and she&amp;rsquo;s so much fun.</description>

JH: Original cast member Jorja Fox is coming back for a handful of episodes. Is she coming back in the same role with the CSI group or&amp;hellip;?
NS: In a sense, she is stepping into her old role but it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a different Sara. The Sara who left was burnt out, was pretty messed up by the job and what happened to her but when she first came back there was a big question mark in her life which was the nature of her relationship with Grissom but that actually got resolved in a very happy way.</description>

      <description>One of the many conflicts about Thursday night TV is this:
I don&amp;rsquo;t watch CSI regularly (weak stomach), but the thought of Jorja Fox and Marg Helgenberger together forever with no Grissom in sight certainly earns the show a place on the DVR, even if I have to FF through the icky parts.
But a spoiler dropped this week turns out to be ickier than all of the carved corpses in creation.</description>

Question: What’s this I hear about some unexpected surprise coming out in the CSI premiere about Sara? &amp;ndash;Encarni
Ausiello: [http://www.people.com/people/videos/0,,20306231,00.html She got hitched to Grissom when no one was looking]. But that’s old news. Here’s some (relatively) new news from exec producer Naren Shankar: “Do not miss the first two-and-a-half minutes of CSI season premiere. It will blow your mind. It may be one of the most incredible things we’ve ever put on film.</description>

Also lending a hand is the returning Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who drops in to relieve Catherine&amp;rsquo;s shorthanded staff. Helgenberger says the character, who is newly married(!), is a great deal happier than when we last saw her.
&amp;ldquo;When Sara left CSI, she&amp;rsquo;d had it and couldn&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore. She needed a big break,&amp;rdquo; Helgenberger says. &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s in a much better place now.&amp;rdquo;

8. Getting Fooled Again
The last time &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans saw Sara Sidle, Grissom had surprised her in the jungle in season 9 and the two shared a steamy kiss. Now Jorja Fox is back again for five &amp;#8212; count &amp;lsquo;em, five! &amp;#8212; episodes in season 10. Is Grissom next?

While executive producer Anthony Zuiker was mum and [Jorja] Fox was cagey on some high-tech opening sequence that she&amp;rsquo;d only say &amp;lsquo;will knock your socks off,&amp;rsquo; [Marg] Helgenberger showed a little leg, or tried to. &amp;lsquo;It starts with this technique, it&amp;rsquo;s this lack of better way of describing it &amp;ndash; these specialty cameras, almost this freeze-action kind of thing &amp;ndash; but it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the opening yet, but it was very arduous shooting it.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s where the idea for a new show in the Star Trek franchise comes in.
The show would focus on a set of characters who are the Star Fleet equivalent of an internal affairs bureau on a cop show.</description>

      <description>Less that a year after reuninting in the jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox is heading back to CSI this fall &amp;#8212; alone. But don&amp;rsquo;t take Fox&amp;rsquo;s five-episode to mean that Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s happily-ever-after was a bust. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re absolutely together,&amp;rdquo; insists executive producer, Naren Shankar, who nonetheless says Sara will drop hints at trouble in paradise. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re talking about a coulpe of very independant individuals who have decided to share their life together.</description>

New Project: Um &amp;hellip; &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;
You Can Go Home Again: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled for Jorja&amp;rsquo;s return to &amp;lsquo;CSI,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; said executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The viewers and longtime &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; fans will be excited to discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; team in Las Vegas in our premiere episode.&amp;rdquo;
Follow the (Ratings) Evidence: Looks like the addition of Laurence Fishburne hasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied viewers as much as producers had hoped, who acknowledge the drop in ratings and claim to be &amp;lsquo;listening&amp;rsquo; to fans who haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten over last year&amp;rsquo;s departure of three original cast members.</description>

Executive producers Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar talked to &amp;ldquo;Entertainment Weekly**s Michael Ausiello, and discussed a little bit more about Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s return to the Las Vegas lab for the tenth season of the crime drama.</description>

      <description>Now that the initial burst of excitement surrounding Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s CSI comeback has died down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get down to business &amp;#8212; the business of getting answers to some burning questions! What prompted her return? How long will she be sticking around? What impact will Sara&amp;rsquo;s reappearance have on the rest of the team? And, last but not least, is Grissom next?

Do you people listen to me? Well, some of you do, and the rest of you should. Months ago, I told you about a conversation I had with Jorja Fox when she left &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; At the time, she told me that she&amp;rsquo;d be coming back to the show the next season, but many of you scoffed&amp;ndash;it couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen, I was told. And now, poof, she&amp;rsquo;s back. Foxy returns in the season premiere on September 24th, and will be back for additional episodes.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; season 10 will see a lot of Sara Sidle but none of Riley Adams.&amp;rdquo;
One person in, another is out. While Jorja Fox is welcomed back as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;, an actor has to be let go because the character is not working for the whole show. The unfortunate one would be Lauren Lee Smith aka Riley Adams, the crime investigator who joined the unit in season 9.</description>

      <description>I guess people didn&amp;rsquo;t really warm to Riley Adams after all.
Lauren Lee Smith is not going to be back for the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, executive producer Naren Shankar told TV Guide Magazine. And, much like the departure of Kim Delaney on her first season in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s because the character just wasn&amp;rsquo;t working well as everyone had expected.
&amp;ldquo;It was an issue of how we were feeling the ensemble was working,&amp;rdquo; Shankar said.</description>

So what prompted your return to CSI?
Right around March, I felt really rested and was itching to work&amp;ndash;I was ready and going to meetings and auditioning. When I was in Atlanta [filming a guest shot on Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s Drop Dead Diva], I got the call about CSI&amp;ndash;it was completely out of the blue!</description>

That was the other thing: burlesque&amp;ndash;or at least Dita&amp;rsquo;s burlesque&amp;ndash;is big here. Big space: held at Avalon, which has a capacity to hold a few thousand people, and was sold out. There were multitudes of celebrities in the audience: we spied Margaret Cho and Jorja Fox, (of CSI: Las Vegas), as well as Jenny Lewis (or at least her exact replica). The size of L.A.&amp;rsquo;s geography lends itself to making burlesque seem more than a quick and dirty striptease in a tiny hovel of a club in the Lower East Side.</description>

Item two: It won&amp;rsquo;t be that much of a reunion. The biggest item on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; front is the return of Jorja Fox as Sara Sidle; it&amp;rsquo;s been confirmed that she&amp;rsquo;ll be appearing in the tenth season premiere, and in yet-to-be-disclosed extra episodes. Obvious question is, is Grissom returning? William Petersen is, sadly, not returning to the role. At least not yet.
But executive producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed that some classic characters will be returning to the series.</description>

      <description>When Oscar-nominated film star** Laurence Fishburne** joined the cast of CSI, it seemed like a natural match. CBS was replacing departing star William Petersen with a well-known face and presence.
Best of all, the network&amp;rsquo;s core hit was adding a black man as star in the same month Barack Obama would take office as the nation&amp;rsquo;s first black president.
But after an initial boost in viewership, ratings have sagged for Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s version of CSI.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m worried about &amp;ldquo;CSIs future. Given the poor reception Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s character has been getting, is there any chance CBS will replace him? &amp;ndash; David**
TIM: Nope. A network rep notes that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was still the highest-rated scripted show of the 2008-09 season, and Fishburne was the show runners&amp;rsquo; dream replacement for William Petersen. Also, he&amp;rsquo;s only had half a season to win fans over. Hopefully his use of deadly force in the May finale will herald more of a bold, commanding Fishburne (think &amp;ldquo;Boyz n the Hood&amp;rdquo;) and less of the bookish Professor Langston.</description>

      <description>Oh, Sara Sidle. CSI just can&amp;rsquo;t quit you. Original series actress Jorja Fox will return for five episodes in the new season of the hit crime drama.
Jorja left the show in its eight season, but returned a few times last year in its ninth season for guest appearances. When we last saw Sara, she was caught in an embrace with her bearded boyfriend Gil Grissom, who had left the lab behind for good to meet her in the jungle.</description>

      <description>**Jorja Fox returning to CBS&amp;rsquo; hit drama for multiple episodes. **
What does an actor do when they have an open invitation to return to one of television&amp;rsquo;s biggest shows? Come back, of course.
Actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s revolving-door relationship with &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; continues to spin, as CBS today announced the news that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back to play the popular character Sara Sidle when the forensics drama returns in the fall. Fox left the show as a regular in 2007, but made a short return (and was last seen) during William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s final episode of the show last season.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
When enormously popular William Petersen left CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last season, the series fumbled a couple of million viewers; toward the end of the ninth season, the procedural crime drama was clocking some of its smallest crowds ever, though it remained the country&amp;rsquo;s most watched drama series.
What to do? CBS announced Monday that Jorja Fox, who played Sara Sidle, Petersen&amp;rsquo;s employee and love interest, is returning to reprise her role for &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; episodes.</description>

      <description>Admit it, that question is very much a natural, not after that long string of events stretching way back to the seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;-Sara and Grissom finally address their relationship, the Miniature Killer gets in the way, she leaves to address her past, he leaves to move on (to her, natch)&amp;hellip;
But yes, just in case you still can&amp;rsquo;t believe what you&amp;rsquo;ve read elsewhere, Jorja Fox is returning to the tenth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>When last we saw actress Jorja Fox on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, her alter ego Sara Sidle was deep in the Costa Rican jungle, happily reunited with the love of her life, Gil Grissom. Well, apparently Sara&amp;rsquo;s going to have some very good reason to leave that romantic idyll because come this fall, Jorja Fox is returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; for five episodes.
There&amp;rsquo;s no indication that William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Gil is joining her, although since Petersen is still connected to the show as an executive producer, he could decide to pop in for a show or two.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox left the grimy Las Vegas crime scenes of &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; for sun, surf and soul searching. But now she&amp;rsquo;s set to return as Sara Sidle for a much anticipated five-episode arc on the series&amp;rsquo; 10th season (premiering Sept. 24 on CBS). There&amp;rsquo;s wild speculation around the circumstances of her visit &amp;#8212; Is another CSI in danger? Are Sara and Grissom still together? &amp;#8212; and AOL TV grilled her mercilessly for the juicy details.</description>

      <description>Following an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama&amp;rsquo;s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will &amp;ldquo;reappear&amp;rdquo; in a September 24th episode where viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in its upcoming season.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a rocky relationship for Fox and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, with the actress leaving and returning once before over salary and contract disputes.
Her return will only be temporary, as she&amp;rsquo;s just signed on to star in a handful of episodes for the season. Thus far.
We&amp;rsquo;d advise her not to look a gift horse in the mouth this time!</description>

      <description>Bah, we all somehow saw it coming, right? After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she&amp;rsquo;s arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; which aired yesterday.
That detail&amp;rsquo;s been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was announced.</description>

Less than a year after walking off into the sunset jungle with leading man William Petersen, Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as Sara for multiple episodes &amp;#8212; sans Grissom.
According to executive producer Carol Mendelsohn, Fox will reappear in the Sept. 24 episode when viewers will &amp;ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; team in Las Vegas.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox can&amp;rsquo;t seem stay away from &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;.
The actress &amp;#8212; who played a Las Vegas forensic scientist named Sara Sidle &amp;#8212; will be a part of the upcoming season premiere and additional episodes of the long-running CBS drama, the network said Friday.

      <description>It was only a matter of time before Jorja Fox found herself in a pair of handcuffs.
The off-again, on-again &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star makes a guest appearance on Lifetime&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&amp;rdquo; Sunday at 9 p.m., playing a soccer mom with a felonious past.
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into an orange jumpsuit for years,&amp;rdquo; Fox told the Daily News. &amp;ldquo;I hope I pulled it off.&amp;rdquo;

The new season will have other changes; Lauren Lee Smith has left the show, and Mendelsohn said there is no casting going on at present to replace her character (though it sounded as that could change down the road).

      <description>3. Best Goodbye
With a new &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Laurence Fishburne) handpicked to join the team, Gil Grissom leaves the lab &amp;ndash; and the show &amp;ndash; with just a nod to Catherine Willows. But where&amp;rsquo;s he going with such peaceful confidence? To the thick vegetation of a Costa Rican rain forest &amp;ndash; and the arms of a smiling Sara Sidle.</description>

CSI Files: Three cast members departed &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; within the space of a calendar year, starting with Jorja Fox back in season eight.
Hall: Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) was one of my closest friends on the show, and she just needed to move on in her life. I miss her every time I go on the lot, but she&amp;rsquo;s surfing in the morning, getting ready to do some movie or something, and I think she&amp;rsquo;s happy as a clam.</description>

      <description>I always get so excited for the Green with Glamour seasonal celeb photoshoots - they&amp;rsquo;re festive, fashion-y and oh-so-sexy! For the Spring/Summer 09 look, we were feeling pretty damned good about ourselves and went for a &amp;lsquo;top of the world&amp;rsquo; theme, deliciously shot on the rooftop of The Chapman Building (many thanks to GwG&amp;rsquo;s dear friend and loft tenant, Matthew Vafiadis!) The location was divine, but I have to admit the whole inspiration for our &amp;lsquo;world-topping&amp;rsquo; thing came once I knew the lovely Jorja Fox was on board to be our &amp;lsquo;model&amp;rsquo;.</description>

I have a whole new appreciation for Riley after &amp;lsquo;No Way Out&amp;rsquo; because any lady who takes pistol-whipping like that deserves hats off. I truly am looking forward to seeing Adams&amp;rsquo; character in depth, and Lauren Lee Smith is a talented individual. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she will soon become a favorite, and give the girl a break; it can&amp;rsquo;t be easy following in the footsteps of Jorja Fox. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Fox was so loved that some of the fans where near padlocking her to the set - not that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t donate a chain or two to that cause, as I am a die hard Sara Sidle fan and I miss her terribly, but we have to eventually move on guysâ¦.</description>

Not only is Petersen an executive producer of the hit series, but he&amp;rsquo;s also busy planning a way to bring the bug-loving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; boss back next year with a European adventure. And for the first time he has confirmed there will be a &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; film.
[&amp;hellip;]
But even more pressing is his plan to bring Grissom back next season in a two-part television story set in France.
&amp;ldquo;We have an idea for how it would happen - now Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) and I are out of the show, we could pull something off in Europe without disrupting the other episodes they have to shoot.</description>

&amp;lsquo;The first time Anthony Edwards directed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, he had this epic idea to shoot all of act two as one fluid Steadicam shot. We came in and rehearsed it all morning like a stage play.
The scene took place in the emergency room and included almost the entire cast and recurring cast and several guest actors &amp;ndash; maybe thirty actors altogether. If I remember right, the camera followed Laura Innes&amp;rsquo;s character, Dr.</description>

      <description>Crime Scene Investigation has long been the televisual highlight of the week in my house, so it was with some sadness that I tuned in last week to witness the apparent demise of one of the show&amp;rsquo;s greatest assets: the relationship between team supervisor Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and CSI Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). What made this portrayal of heterosexuality so notable was not anything intrinsically subversive about its set-up (older, more powerful guy gets it on with younger, more attractive woman) but the refreshingly non-formulaic way it was represented.</description>

 Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Petersen) in &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Why, oh why, must it be Sara? Office romance is inevitable sometimes and their relationship was hinted at early on in the series.
 Understandably, working closely together at the crime lab and crime scenes leave little time for both Sara and Grissom to do any socialising. Plus, they share the same interests &amp;ndash; bugs, blood, logic.</description>

History: Forensic examiner Gil Grissom (William Petersen) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly lucky with the ladies. Dominatrix-turned-therapist Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) only comes into his life when she&amp;rsquo;s a murder suspect, when her daughter is murdered and when her kinky past is helpful to Grissom in solving a case. As for his subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), their relationship is only hinted at until he proposes in season 8.</description>

CBS had thousands of viewers popping antacids as they anxiously awaited word on whether the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer&amp;rdquo; had offed Sidle, his last victim. Thank God the network negotiated a deal to have Fox stick around for a few guest spots on season nine. Last week Grissom (William Petersen) passed the baton and said farewell to a life of blood and gore before showing up unexpectedly in the jungle to surprise Sara with a little monkey lovin&amp;rsquo;.</description>

Q CSI has been a hit since its debut. So why would the producers drop three of its biggest stars: William Petersen, Jorja Fox, and Gary Dourdan?
*&amp;ndash;Ala Smith, Clovis, Calif.*
A After eight years, viewers get tired of the same faces&amp;ndash;and actors get bored doing the same thing. Those three stars all left voluntarily. Incidentally, while Marg Helgenberger has survived the CSI upheaval, she and actor Alan Rosenberg recently separated after 19 years.</description>

With sincere apologies to the male fans, I&amp;rsquo;m going to believe the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; writers wrote this William Petersen swan song especially for me &amp;#8212; okay, me and the millions of other female viewers &amp;#8212; who believe a happy ending is possible for just about anyone, even a moody sleuth in a perpetual state of emotional lockdown. Sappy sendoff? Perhaps. Satisfying?

SPOILER ALERT! Discussion of the final scene in Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s last episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; follows. Read on at your own risk.
That last scene in last night&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; saw Grissom (William Petersen) trekking through a Costa Rican jungle, coming upon Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and swooping her into his arms for a big Hollywood kiss. It was essentially a reverse of the way Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) departed &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; with Doug Ross (George Clooney) coming back to fly away with her.</description>

      <description>The final moment of Gil Grissom&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; career &amp;#8212; and the surprise first moment of the rest of his life &amp;#8212; were in the planning stages for two years.
That may be why the closing scene of Thursday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was so satisfying. Yes, we are going to discuss spoilers here, so run to your DVR or cbs.com and get caught up. We&amp;rsquo;ll wait.
The departure of William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character from in front of the camera was mapped out in long conversations between two of the show&amp;rsquo;s two executive producers, Petersen and co-star Jorja Fox, according to Carol Mendelsohn, one of the showrunners on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; who has been overseeing production of the show since episode one.</description>

A: According to industry sources, the film (which we first reported on in 2005) is very much on the fast track, and out writer/director Jessica Sharzer has just turned in a polish of her screenplay.
But Viacom and CBS reportedly have a competing project in the works produced by &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox and based on the live stage show Stay Forever: The Life and Music, written by and starring Kirsten Holly Smith.</description>

      <description>The City Council temporarily halted construction of a new $42 million elephant exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo on Wednesday amid concerns over funding and a debate over whether the animals should be kept in zoos at all.
The vote came after the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association offered to pay an additional $14 million to finish the exhibit.

At the council meeting, activists and celebrities including comedian Lily Tomlin and actress Jorja Fox said the zoo&amp;rsquo;s costly exhibit would do nothing to alleviate painful foot diseases that often lead to death among captive elephants.</description>

Question: Have we really seen the last of Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Last week&amp;rsquo;s ending of Episode 2 was heartbreaking. The creators have invested years hinting at, building up and finally revealing the relationship between Gil and Sara. I appreciate that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all hearts and flowers, but now that Petersen is leaving the show anyway, why not let these two tortured characters have a happy ending together? â Patrice</description>

      <description>I WAS shocked at the amount of wrinkle-relaxing poison in the face of Jorja Fox when I watched CSI last week. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any. She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.
She was back for Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues&amp;rsquo; face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn&amp;rsquo;t look remotely upset, even though she said she was.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised to learn that so many of you got choked up at the gut-wrenching scenes from Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, but I was taken aback by some commentary regarding Sara&amp;rsquo;s appearance &amp;ndash; namely, whether or not she was with child, and if her condition would eventually explain her abrupt decision to leave Las Vegas last season. All I can say is &amp;ndash; good God, no. Look, I hated her poofy dress (and the curls she wore with it) probably as much as the next fan, but never in my wildest dreams would I have considered she was trying to cover up a secret pregnancy.</description>

Question: So, you are one of the lucky privileged people who got to see the premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; early. What is the deal with Grissom-Sara? All of these interviews and articles make it sound like their relationship is in huge amounts of trouble. &amp;#8212; Sarah
Ausiello: I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any signs of trouble in the first episode, but the hour isn&amp;rsquo;t really about them; it&amp;rsquo;s about Warrick. If anything, the one significant scene they &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; share in the Oct.</description>

Celebrities such as actors James Cromwell, Jorja Fox, John Schneider, Marc Vann and Alicia Silverstone were among the approximately 300 people who mingled with the sanctuary&amp;rsquo;s 150 cows, pigs, goats, turkeys and chickens for an evening of vegan food, music and entertainment.</description>

      <description>None of us wanted her to go, least of all Gil Grissom &amp;hellip; so it&amp;rsquo;s great news that Jorja Fox, aka CSI Sara Sidle, will return to reprise her role in season nine. Fox is expected to appear in the first three episodes of the year as the team lay Warrick Brown to rest.
Don&amp;rsquo;t bank on any resolution to the truncated love-story between Grissom and Sara, though. As Fox recently told &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, talking about their feelings isn&amp;rsquo;t something the pair find easy: &amp;ldquo;As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous.</description>

Chevy Chase, Jorja Fox (late of CSI), guys from &amp;ldquo;The Daily Show&amp;rdquo; Rosey Grier (in a wheelchair and gray-haired now) Rep.

As part of a cross-country tour, ADI spokesperson Fox presented Council Member Lee Leffingwell with a copy of the report. Referring to &amp;ldquo;The ABCD&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; acquisition, brutality, confinement, disposal&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that are an inherent part of the circus industry, she highlighted the success of human-performer-only circuses like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese State Circus.</description>

      <description>Circuses advertise a joyful, colorful form of entertainment, but for circus animals, the shows hold dark promises of horrible living conditions that force animals into miserable confinements, according to animal advocacy groups.
Circuses featuring exotic animals may be banned from Austin in the future after Animal Defenders International, an animal rights group, presented an abuse report to the Austin City Council Friday.
The London-based group asked Austin City Council to ban these circuses in the city of Austin as part of the group&amp;rsquo;s nationwide campaign.</description>

Nerdiest Cop: Sara Sidle, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;
You gotta love her: She&amp;rsquo;s dry, supersmart, slightly damaged and obsessed with cadavers. The original &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t what you&amp;rsquo;d call a character-driven show, but Sara Sidle has more personality than all her co-workers combined. Too bad depression got the best of this geek guru. We can only hope for the surprise return of her character &amp;#8212; and, hopefully, no more lab explosions.</description>

Q Will actress Jorja Fox ever return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?&amp;ndash;Betty Rudder, Mascot, Tenn.
A We&amp;rsquo;ve received dozens of letters like yours since Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in November and told us she needed a break from the daily grind. She then turned down several TV movies to focus on producing a musical about the late singer Dusty Springfield, which was staged in L.A. earlier this year. But Jorja, who&amp;rsquo;ll turn 40 this week, always hoped to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, and fans will be thrilled to learn that she&amp;rsquo;ll be back on the season premiere this fall.</description>

      <description>Inside sources reveal top secrets about the season&amp;rsquo;s biggest burning questions
[&amp;hellip;]
Why did CSI&amp;rsquo;s Warrick have to die (and was the story line influenced by Gary Dourdan&amp;rsquo;s real-life troubles)?
&amp;ldquo;Executive Producer Carol Mendelsohn says&amp;rdquo;: We thought that if we ever lost Warrick [Dourdan], this was the way he would go. Warrick&amp;rsquo;s a local guy. The only family he had was Grissom [William Petersen] and the team, so this was not a guy who was going to leave Las Vegas or CSI.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans have not seen the last of Sara Sidle. In fact, the time has come for fans to welcome one of the key players of the forensic drama, Jorja Fox, whose character left the series in the season 7 episode &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck&amp;rdquo; where she had to go face the ghost of her past.
According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, the 39-year-old actress has just inked a deal to return for &amp;ldquo;CSI**s ninth season premiere next fall.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; boss Carol Mendelsohn wasn&amp;rsquo;t pulling my leg when she told me last October that we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the last of Sara Sidle. Sources confirm that Jorja Fox has inked a deal to return for the show&amp;rsquo;s ninth-season premiere next fall.
Specifics of her comeback are being kept under lock and key, but my &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; mole assures me that she &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rsquo;t be appearing in a flashback.&amp;rdquo; The likely scenario has Sara returning to Vegas to shag Grissom mourn ex-colleague Warrick, who was shot (and presumably) killed in last week&amp;rsquo;s finale.</description>

      <description>When Sara left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, driving out of Las Vegas on her way to who knows what, he left behind a brokenhearted Gil Grissom. The producers of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; were wise to keep the door open for the character to return, and that&amp;rsquo;s just what&amp;rsquo;s happening &amp;#8212; at least for one show. According to &amp;ldquo;TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, Jorja Fox will be in the season premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. Oh, and she won&amp;rsquo;t be the only former cast mate on the show; so will Gary Dourdan as Warrick.</description>

      <description>SPOILER ALERT
Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on the original &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, will return for at least the show&amp;rsquo;s ninth season premiere next fall, according to the show&amp;rsquo;s boss, Carol Mendelsohn.
The news comes via &amp;ldquo;TV Guide**s Michael Ausiello, who says that Fox&amp;rsquo;s character won&amp;rsquo;t be in a flashback, but the most likely scenario would be Sara returning to Vegas to mourn the death of ex-colleague Warrick. Who, of course, was shot and (presumably) killed in last week&amp;rsquo;s season finale.</description>

      <description>In her eight years working the Las Vegas graveyard shift, Sara Sidle faced more than her fair share of heartache, which eventually resulted in her leaving Sin City for good. Actress Jorja Fox recalls her time on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and reveals why it was the right moment for her to leave the show.

When it comes to Sara Sidle, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a case of gone but not forgotten for the show&amp;rsquo;s millions of fans.</description>

Question: What happened to Catherine finding the picture of Grissom and Sara that was teased all week? That scene sure wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; I watched on Thursday! â Kathy
Ausiello: Good question â let&amp;rsquo;s ask exec producer Carol Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;The scene where Catherine finds Sara&amp;rsquo;s picture on Grissom&amp;rsquo;s fridge is really fun. But the paradox of writing a procedural is that sometimes even our favorite scenes (scenes that show the personal lives of our CSIs) aren&amp;rsquo;t required by the narrative.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;] Carita writes &amp;#8216;Is Jorja Fox returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?&amp;rsquo; Well, let&amp;rsquo;s examine the evidence, Carita. Last fall, on the eve of Fox&amp;rsquo;s swan song, executive producer Carol Mendhelson said quote &amp;ldquo;Fans will not have seen the last of Sarah Sidle &amp;#8212; nor will Grissom.&amp;rdquo; unquote. Cut to last Thursday, Sara&amp;rsquo;s spirit loomed large in an episode that confirmed what we all knew: Grissom is far from over his ex-partner. Sure sounds like a Sara comeback is imminent right?</description>

What did you think of [Grissom&amp;rsquo;s] relationship with Sara (Jorja Fox)?
It&amp;rsquo;s really worked for Jorja Fox and me to play Sara Sidle and Grissom and have this sort of adult relationship.</description>

DEAR STACY: Why did Jorja Fox leave her role as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? This saddens many of us. &amp;ndash; Beverly L., North Bergen, N.J.
DEAR BEVERLY: Fox left the show last year, saying she wanted a break from the rigors of weekly TV production. Her departure came after years of drama over her status with the show. She and fellow costar George Eads were fired &amp;ndash; temporarily &amp;ndash; back in &amp;lsquo;04, when their contract renegotiations went sour.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to tell you, but I recently went with Jenifer Lewis to LA&amp;rsquo;s Gay and Lesbian Center to see &amp;ldquo;Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield,&amp;rdquo; which was co-produced by Jorja Fox. Due to the limitations of this presentation, certain aspects of the show couldn&amp;rsquo;t be fleshed out &amp;lt;&amp;gt; making it somewhat unclear whether this was an actual play or a very good lounge act. What is undeniable is that Kristen Holly Smith is a goldmine of talent and knowledge (she co-wrote the piece).</description>

t was quite the celebrity day in Hollywood today. I just barely saved myself from looking like a total jackass to CSI star, Jorja Fox. Here&amp;rsquo;s the scoop: Being &amp;ldquo;on deck&amp;rdquo; at my voiceover agency to audition, means lingering my the desks of the assistants, who are awesome. I enjoy chit chat with the Tallest-Assistant-In-The-World, Jeff, who is almost 7 feet and hilarious.

      <description>If ever a TV couple shared some great chemistry it&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom.
But after years of successfully concealing their relationship from their colleagues - and from us - no sooner is the cat out of the bag, than Sara&amp;rsquo;s off.
So now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if maybe it was just the secrecy that was the real attraction for Sara, and the thought of being able to hold hands with Gil in the CSI canteen and drive in to work together each day is just too mundane for words.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox and Kirsten Holly Smith talk about the life and music of Dusty Springfield.
For millions the music and life of Dusty Springfield has grand significance. More specifically, as a woman who was producing music in the man&amp;rsquo;s world of music making, a performer who professionally protested Apartheid (before it was de rigueur) and a household name who came out of the closet, Springfield&amp;rsquo;s music and life meant much more to specific groups such as women, blacks and gays.</description>

Marg Helgenberger: We only shot a couple of episodes more after she left but it was sad. Everybody reacted very differently and you don&amp;rsquo;t even really think about it until you have the party and it&amp;rsquo;s your last day and everyone shows up. Then it becomes the big, emotional thing. It hit some people really hard that day.</description>

      <description>Can you please enlighten me about Jorja Fox/Sara leaving on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Surely CBS is not abandoning the romance story between her and Grissom after teasing us about it for over a year?! Will Sarah come back to the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; show or have we seen the last of her? It would be a real bummer if she disappears from the show. I may quit watching if she goes!
1p6,1p6 Before Fox&amp;rsquo;s departure, it was widely reported that she and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; could not agree on a new contract.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Doing this show was one of the most rewarding things in my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve been one of the luckiest people in the history of TV getting to play Sara. My character had a full personal life, with a couple boyfriends, a couple meltdowns. She was almost killed a couple of times. They almost blew me up one! I feel like the writers were extremely generous in terms of giving me a lot to do, especially all the interesting relationship stuff between Sara and Grissom.</description>

      <description>REVIEW | Dazzling visuals set pace for TV procedurals, making departure of Fox or anyone else secondary
Jorja Fox fans surely will be bummed when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; returns with a new episode tonight. Fox left the show a few weeks ago, and she took away her character, Sara Sidle. But don&amp;rsquo;t expect &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; to suffer much because, duh, the true star of America&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 drama is its sci-fi special effects.</description>

      <description>Though Sara Sidle has already left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, fans of the forensic drama are still determined to convey their support to her portrayer, Jorja Fox.
Previously, fans combined their efforts to come up with a &amp;ldquo;Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign&amp;rdquo; to prevent the 39-year-old actress from leaving the show. When Fox officially exited the CBS series, the excess money raised by the crusade was donated to charity. And now that the campaign is over, a new drive is being created that aims to thank the former &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; actress.</description>

      <description>Question: Just wanted to thank you for your recent comments about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and Jorja Fox. Your response to Sandra S.&amp;rsquo; question about whether Grissom and Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationship hurt &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was the most accurate evaluation of their romance and the last couple of seasons of the show that I&amp;rsquo;ve read. It was nice to see someone in the media not jumping on the &amp;ldquo;they turned the show into a soap opera!&amp;rdquo; bandwagon, which so many fans inexplicably have joined.</description>

Question: There has been speculation that in last week&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, the letter Sara left for Grissom wasn&amp;rsquo;t a breakup letter but a suicide note. Do you know anything about this? &amp;ndash; Ginny
Ausiello: I know that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty silly theory, considering what Carol Mendelsohn told me last month.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll preface this by admitting that I was not a big Sara fan. I think I turned against Jorja Fox after the first contract dispute. To me, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is more of an ensemble show, so even though I have my favorites, *cough* Warrick *cough*, I resented the impression I got that she thought she was more important than any of the others. Besides that, I kinda wanted Lady Heather to loosen Grissom up a bit.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday marked the departure of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) from the long-running hit drama &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo;
Appearing as a guest co-host on &amp;ldquo;The View&amp;rdquo; this week, Fox says she&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;fortunate&amp;rdquo; to have been a part of the series. She went on to say that the decision to leave was &amp;ldquo;the hardest decision I ever made.&amp;rdquo;
The actress is an original cast member from debut season in 2000, as a quasi love interest for lead investigator Gil Grissom.</description>

      <description>After eight seasons on one of TV&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated shows, Jorja Fox left the CBS drama &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; Thursday night.
Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the hot TV series, has told several publications that she decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s one of the hardest decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made in my life,&amp;rdquo; Fox told Entertainment Weekly. &amp;ldquo;It has nothing to do with my contract, nothing to do with money.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck&amp;rdquo; was Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last appearance on the popular CBS series &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; after a seven-year tenure on the show.
Forensic scientist Sara Sidle, the character Fox had portrayed since 2000, was very popular with fans â so much so that, when the actress was fired in 2004. It was a temporary dismissal, as the public reacted strongly, demanding that she return.
Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s episode was the last Fox filmed as Sara Sidle and a worthy farewell for a notable character.</description>

&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is probably a strong enough concept to survive cast changes, witness the success of the two spinoffs. But until now, its producers and CBS have never had to wonder. The original cast from the pilot episode-Petersen, Helgenberger, George Eads, Gary Dourdan, and Paul Guilfoyle-is still intact. Jorja Fox joined the cast for the second episode, and her Sara Sidle character becomes the first major departure from the show tonight.</description>

      <description>Question: Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; episode just aired, and that got me to thinking about all the brouhaha back when the relationship between Grissom and Sara was revealed in the Season 6 finale. At the time, there were dire predictions that this was the end of the rope for the series. It had become a soap, turned a corner, jumped the shark, etc. Looking back at it now, do you think that the romance &amp;ndash; its reveal, and the way it was woven into Seasons 7 and 8 &amp;ndash; was a detriment to the show?</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.&amp;rdquo;
With this brief interchange, crime scene investigator Sara Sidle made her first appearance on the CBS hit show, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Yesterday, she made her final appearance. After a tumultuous seven years on the show, actress Jorja Fox finally packed up her fingerprint kit.
Fox enjoyed a long run of success with the show as a materials and element analysis specialist who was originally brought in during the first season by Gil Grissom (actor William Petersen) to do an internal affairs investigation.</description>

      <description>Which is the better way to go out, with a bang or a whimper? Unlike its Miami-based counterpart, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has never been about the bang. The flagship show&amp;rsquo;s characters are more cerebral, its sets dressed in somber blues. It may have made for better storytelling to have Sara Sidle die at the hands of the Miniature Killer, but her actual departure fit better with the show&amp;rsquo;s sensibilities.

      <description>For months, we&amp;rsquo;ve all known it was coming - the departure of a beloved &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; (8 p.m., KRQE News 13) character.
Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) makes her last appearance in tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode, and mostly this makes me sad.
She&amp;rsquo;s an interesting and complex character who truly bonds with people. I like her eccentricities, and while her hair will never be as cute as Catherine&amp;rsquo;s (Marg Helgenberger), she still manages to look good while knee deep in gross stuff.</description>

      <description>Fans put through ringer on Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s farewell episode
Do the creators of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; enjoy torturing their fans?
Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last appearance as a regular (Wednesday night at 9 on WBZ, Ch. 4) was bound to be difficult. &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck&amp;rdquo; is excruciating. Given the final moments, the title seems cruelly ironic.
CBS has asked that I refrain from any potential spoilers. If the network were serious, it would have gagged both Fox and the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers weeks ago.</description>

After seven years of playing Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox is ready to exit the forensic drama and move on. But before she leaves, the 39-year-old actress will be portraying her character one last time, giving closure to the &amp;ldquo;Grissom Sara Romance&amp;rdquo; many fans have learned to adore, in tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode entitled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck.</description>

      <description>Original &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; cast member Jorja Fox leaves the hit CBS drama Thursday night, but expect the series to be just fine without her.
&amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; which debuted in 2000, has been the most-watched scripted show on TV for the past five years, and its audience isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere.
&amp;ldquo;&amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; has built its success over the years by being more story-driven than star-driven,&amp;rdquo; Vincent Fitzgerald, who heads the communications department at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale, told the Daily News.</description>

      <description>AS if &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t de pressing enough, to night&amp;rsquo;s episode is devoted entirely to the disillusionment of Sara Sidle.
It&amp;rsquo;s the long-awaited episode in which sourpuss Sara (Jorja Fox) makes her exit from the show - finally.
Fox had been rumored to be on the way out last season when it seemed as if her character would not survive being pinned under a car in the cliff- hanging final episode following an &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo; engineered by the serial murderer known as &amp;ldquo;the miniature killer.</description>

      <description>Watch tonight&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and you too will understand why Jorja Fox - Sara Sidle - quit.
Murders, suicide, a drag and dump (whatever that is), woman with knife in back, pre-pubescent homicidal insanity&amp;hellip;all within 44 minutes. You&amp;rsquo;d quit too. One wonders what kind of toll this takes on an intelligent sensitive actress like Fox - year after year of it. She told &amp;ldquo;EW&amp;rdquo; that she wanted to start a family, but starting families requires a certain frame of mind, and &amp;ldquo;optimism&amp;rdquo; has to be a basic minimum requirement â optimism about life, your life, and the life of your unborn children.</description>

      <description>Beloved characters deserve fitting farewells, and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) receives one tonight from CSI.
The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; vividly makes you feel Sara&amp;rsquo;s disillusionment with her work. In witnessing an eerie case of domestic abuse, she remains oddly remote.
The real crisis for Sara, however, comes from familiar sources. Returning in creepy style are Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his genius little sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia).</description>

      <description>CSI is a curiosity. Long before the popular procedural drama became TV&amp;rsquo;s most-watched crime show, it bucked TV convention. CSI debuted on the same night and the same network as a slick, glossy remake of The Fugitive, one of TV&amp;rsquo;s most respected and fondly remembered classics. The conventional wisdom was that The Fugitive remake, starring a dashing Tim Daly, would be a hit, and CSI would be lucky if it played out the string for a season or two.</description>

      <description>Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m too well-adjusted to relate (and that would be a first), but Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) departs CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; (9 tonight) in the most unrealistic, only-on-TV way possible.
To really get into a critique of her departure would entail giving away things that CBS has asked critics not to reveal, but from my perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s not how real people say goodbye to those they love.
The episode finds Sara confronting a case from her past when a crime in the present sends a coed plunging out a dorm room window.</description>

      <description>When I finally sat down to watch an advance copy of tonight&amp;rsquo;s CSI showing the exit of fan protest magnet Jorja Fox, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help thinking of Devon Pierce.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular blog reader, you know I wrote about Pierce weeks ago, outlining her efforts from a room in her father&amp;rsquo;s Dunedin hearing aid clinic to run a massive fan effort aimed at convincing CSI producers to keep Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle character on the show.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character is written out of CSI in a way that writes her off.
[&amp;hellip;]
As somebody who has never really understood the popularity of CBS&amp;rsquo;s three blockbuster CSI series, watching each episode is like getting random pokes from a tiny acupuncture needle every time something outlandish happens.
So watching an advance copy of tonight&amp;rsquo;s installment from the mothership CSI, the last episode featuring fan protest magnet Jorja Fox, felt a little like this:</description>

      <description>On last week&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, in the crossover stunt featuring &amp;ldquo;Without a Trace**s Jack Malone, Sara Sidle was shown as visibly shaken at an especially unsettling crime scene, walking away as if she&amp;rsquo;d had enough. Her psychological unease and emotional exhaustion had been well established even before last season&amp;rsquo;s cliff-hanger that left her trapped under a car in the desert, as fans wondered all summer if TV&amp;rsquo;s top procedural was going to kill off one of its own.</description>

&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;
Jorja Fox is one gutsy gal. After eight seasons on one of TV&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated shows, Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, is leaving. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t fired. She decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests. At least that&amp;rsquo;s what she has told several publications. Will she be back? That&amp;rsquo;s what fans of the Sara-Grissom relationship want to know. After all, they are engaged. A season-finale surprise appearance might be the way to go, if you ask me.</description>

There are a couple of notable departures on television tonight, csistarting Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s last regular appearance as Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (9 p.m., CBS).
As you may already know, Fox &amp;ndash; who has had a sometimes contentious relationship with the folks who produce the series &amp;ndash; decided to bow out of the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; world earlier this year, giving the writers a chance to prepare a proper farewell to an important character.</description>

      <description>The TV hit series CSI will lose Jorja Fox as one of their starring actors.
Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; is leaving the show to pursue other opportunities. Fox has been on the show since it premiered in 2000.
Fox first broke the news in October that she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities before she gets too old.
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character valuable to show, and she&amp;rsquo;s a role model, readers say
It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. But whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves âCSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re more concerned that the show will suffer without her.</description>

      <description>Readers dish on why Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s departure from &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; should be celebrated
In October, Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle on &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; since the show premiered in 2000, told EW.com she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities &amp;ldquo;before (she) gets too old.&amp;rdquo; We asked readers to weigh in on her departure, and while some fans were upset over the seemingly definite demise of GSR, others were practically jubilant.</description>

&amp;bull;If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (CBS, 9 ET/PT), you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard this was coming. Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably picked up on the signs the past few weeks, as Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle has given way to horror and despair.
Tonight, Fox says goodbye to Sara and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, exiting in a terrific episode that uses an old case (a child who tricked her back in 2006) to make her confront her current problems.</description>

      <description>In just a few days, viewers will have to say farewell to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle. After seven years of portraying the Las Vegas forensic scientist and one of the core players of the show, Jorja Fox has ultimately decided to move on and have a break from the commitment of a weekly television series. But before she leaves, she&amp;rsquo;ll be playing Sara one last time in the episode fittingly called &amp;ldquo;Goodbye and Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; which airs on Thursday, November 15.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;After eight years playing Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox is bitting farewell to&amp;rdquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. &amp;ldquo;In an exclusive interview with&amp;rdquo; The Official CSI Magazine, &amp;ldquo;the actress chats about her final episodes&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
November 8, 2007 proved a sad day for &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; fans when Sara Sidle left the Las Vegas Crime Lab for the last time. After escaping death at the nads of minature kill Natalie Kimble in the season eight opener &amp;ldquo;Dead Doll,&amp;rdquo; the gutsy CSI had struggled to settle back into her job, with even a marriage proposal from Grissom doing little to raise her spirits.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle leaves &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Thursday night. No matter how you feel about that development, the episode is tremendous. All actors who depart long-running series should receive such heartfelt, memorable sendoffs.
The episode, titled &amp;ldquo;Goodbye &amp;amp; Good Luck,&amp;rdquo; skillfully makes you feel Sara&amp;rsquo;s disillusionment. She witnesses an eerie case of domestic abuse and remains strangely remote.
But the real crisis for Sara arrives with the return of Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his genius little sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia).</description>

Jorja Fox
This CSI is in desperate need of the style police. Hopefully she puts more of an effort into her post-CSI job hunt than she does into her wardrobe because this ensemble is seriously lacking in interest. The top is unflattering, the skirt is shapeless and the shoes look more orthopaedic than red carpet ready.</description>

      <description>Well &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans, it looks like its official. Despite the online campaigns and petitions set up by fans to keep her around, Jorja Fox is leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. TV Guide&amp;rsquo;s Ausiello interviewed Fox last month and at that time, she refused to respond to the rumors about her departure from the series. Today, Entertainment Weekly has reported that the rumors are true.
Fox reportedly told &amp;ldquo;EW&amp;rdquo; that her decision to leave the show wasn&amp;rsquo;t money related.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox has confirmed the talk: She has quit &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;There are all these things I want to do,&amp;rdquo; the 39-year-old actress told EW.com yesterday. &amp;ldquo;Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old. If I thought the show were on its last legs, I would&amp;rsquo;ve tried harder to stay the course. But I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s going to be around for a while; if I don&amp;rsquo;t want some of those dreams to pass me by, have to get off the ride for a while.</description>

      <description>It became official on Monday, when Jorja Fox, who plays the recovering alcoholic Sara Sidle on the still-enormously popular CBS crime show, CSI, confirmed to ew.com that she is leaving the show this fall.
There had been much speculation in the TV press that Fox was quitting in this, the show&amp;rsquo;s eighth season. Last season&amp;rsquo;s glimpses of Sara&amp;rsquo;s and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s personal lives (they are a couple) led close followers to believe that Sara was doomed as a character, as no love goes unpunished on this show.</description>

      <description>The noise surrounding Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s reported departure on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has fueled fans to exert great efforts to keep her character, Sara Sidle, on the CBS show. Although the 39-year-old actress has neither confirmed nor denied the controversy, supporters have quickly found ways to demonstrate their support by putting up websites such as The Jorja Fox Appreciation Campaign and Dollars for Sense.
So far, fans&amp;rsquo; efforts include sending letters and flyers to the CBS studios and signing online petitions.</description>

      <description>CSIs Jorja Fox has announced that she&amp;rsquo;s leaving the show, hoping to pursue roles that involve dramatic challenges more demanding than holding a blacklight over a semen-splattered corpse week after week . Thankfully, her departure from the series seems more amicable than that of recent &amp;ldquo;Prison Break&amp;rdquo; escapee Sarah Wayne Callies, so maybe she&amp;rsquo;ll be able to avoid having her severed head wind up in a box on her farewell episode</description>

      <description>Well, I suppose this puts the nail in the coffin. Sorry, Sara Sidle fans.
Despite the promo taunting you all with a Gil-Sara marriage proposal, Jorja Fox has confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that she&amp;rsquo;s leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, saying she will appear in only five episodes this season.
&amp;ldquo;There are all these things I want to do. Some are personal. Some are professional. And I really need to do some of them before I get too old,&amp;rdquo; explains Fox.</description>

She wrapped production on the drama last week. Fox told EW.com exclusively that her decision to give up the role of Sara Sidle had nothing to do with money and everything to with wanting a break from the commitment of a weekly television series.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The actress will hang up her badge in November.&amp;rdquo;
ET confirms that JORJA FOX will be leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo; She will exit the long-running drama sometime in November.
In last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger, it was unclear whether Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, investigator Sara Sidle, would be returning to the show, as her life hung in the balance after she was attacked by the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer.&amp;rdquo;
Fox, who has also starred on &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ER,&amp;rdquo; has been on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; since its beginning in 2000.</description>

      <description>TV executives all over Hollywood must just want to beat Nina Tassler like a gong. The CBS Entertainment chief brought back &amp;ldquo;Jericho&amp;rdquo; for a deserved midseason run and admitted that the &amp;ldquo;Nuts to CBS&amp;rdquo; campaign by fans was a factor in the show&amp;rsquo;s survival. Now every Comic Book Guy and No. #1 Fan out there is managing a campaign to save their favorite canceled show or fired actor. Aside from &amp;ldquo;Jericho&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Cagney and Lacey&amp;rdquo; back in the &amp;lsquo;80s, there&amp;rsquo;s seldom any sign that these campaigns are effective.</description>

      <description>You may have read that Gary Sinise got a healthy salary bump this week. He&amp;rsquo;ll now be pulling down $5 million a year for scowling on CSI: NY. No mention of any increase for his costar, Melina Kanakaredes.
If this television season has taught us anything, it&amp;rsquo;s that women in prime time shouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for raises - unless they are prepared to see their characters tortured or killed.
Take Jorja Fox, who has a history of playing contract hardball with the CSI mothership.</description>

Q: I heard that Jorja Fox is leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; I know she had contract disputes a few years back, but I thought that had been sorted out.
&amp;#8212; A Reader
A: Jorja&amp;rsquo;s contract expired last season, and it apparently has not been renewed. Back in 2004, she and co-star George Eads infamously held out for more money and were unceremoniously fired from the top-rated crime drama. Shortly thereafter they were rehired &amp;#8212; at the same rate they had been paid previously.</description>

      <description>As fans continue to fret about whether Jorja Fox will walk away from her six-figure gig on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, an insider tells EW.com that the Oct. 18 episode will feature a very unorthodox marriage proposal by Gil to Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara. So far, very little has been revealed about the duo&amp;rsquo;s clandestine relationship, though fans first got an idea that something was up in the season finale two years ago, and over last season, when Sara was seen sitting up in bed with Gil (William Peterson) in one episode.</description>

Scenes filmed on campus involved series regular Jorja Fox, who plays Crime Scene Investigator Sara Sidle, and guest star Juliette Goglia, who&amp;rsquo;ll be reprising her role as Hannah West, a 12-year-old genius introduced in the sixth season episode, &amp;ldquo;The Unusual Suspect.&amp;rdquo;
Filmed on the quad outside of Eucalyptus Hall, the crime scene features Sidle speaking with West and showing her photograph. Sidle&amp;rsquo;s words and the photograph provoke West, who becomes upset and starts crying and shouting at her.</description>

      <description>A ratings juggernaut like &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hardly needs the help of a rabid fan campaign. But after news that &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox would be quitting the show, Internet crazies started rallying together to keep her fighting TV crime.
So far, online group Dollarforsense.com has deluged CBS&amp;rsquo;s offices with whack-job gifts in the hopes of keeping Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, on the show. So far, their stunts have stopped just short of being mistaken as the calling cards of one of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s rotating cast of psycho killers.</description>

Best of the Week #2: CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION
It has to be acknowledged that for the first time, fans are finally given a glimpse into the Grissom/Sara backstory. The interaction between the two this week was an example of âhow it&amp;rsquo;s done&amp;rsquo;, acting-wise. As a friend of mine pointed out, it was like watching fan fiction come to life. And with Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s impending departure, that symbolic last scene was just heartbreaking for a die hard GSR shipper like myself.</description>

Question: Got any tidbits about Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s final &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; episode on Nov. 15? &amp;ndash; Tami
Ausiello: I actually just screened the episode, but CBS personally pleaded with me via a standard form letter to refrain from revealing the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of Sara&amp;rsquo;s departure. All that leaves me to scoop is the &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s a vehicle of some sort), the &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s at night) and the &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; (the episode&amp;rsquo;s final frame is a close-up of someone other than Sara).</description>

      <description>&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Scene&amp;rsquo; and unseen**
Jorja Fox will leave the long-running hit &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; next month, TV Guide reports. She&amp;rsquo;s been there seven years, although she and co-star George Eads were temporarily fired after a salary dispute in &amp;lsquo;04.
This is, I think, not a bluff. She&amp;rsquo;s been bitter since that previous contract trouble, and turned down a modest raise then because it entailed a one-year extension.
She told the mag she regrets not working any longer with co-star William Petersen: &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s the most incredible scene partner I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had and he&amp;rsquo;s a great friend.</description>

Then the murder rate doubles when the team gets a second case &amp;#8212; the murder of a HUGH HEFNER-like publisher at a hip new restaurant where customers dine in the dark.

The best part of the episode for many fans may be the return of Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX) to action, following her near-death experience in last week&amp;rsquo;s season premiere.</description>

      <description>Sara sidles out
Sara Sidle, the lab technician character on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; may have survived the first episode of the show&amp;rsquo;s new season. But she won&amp;rsquo;t make it to the last installment.
Jorja Fox, who has played the role on the hit CBS series since it began in 2000, will not complete the current season and will leave after the seventh episode in November, E! Online reports.
Her departure comes after rocky contract negotiations offscreen and an onscreen story line that has been foreshadowing for months a less than happy ending for her character.</description>

      <description>When &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ended last season, the fate of lab tech Sara Sidle was up in the air, both on and off the screen. Viewers were left wondering whether the character would survive, especially since the actress that plays her, Jorja Fox, had not yet renewed her contract. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fox finally made up her mind and will leave the hit show by the end of the year.
Fox will continue to star as her character until the end of 2007, after which she will exit the show.</description>

Some 1,500 women began a 31-city virtual walk across the United States on Monday to benefit breast cancer courtesy of a computer, an avatar and a $3 donation.
Participants included home design guru Martha Stewart, British actress Lynn Redgrave, actress Mena Suvari and Jorja Fox of the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; television show in what organizers said was the world&amp;rsquo;s first interactive virtual walk.</description>

Jorja Fox to sidle off
TVGuide.com&amp;rsquo;s Michael Ausiello reports that even though the &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; character Sara Sidle survived her run-in with the Miniature Killer in Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s gripping season premiere, her time on the show has nonetheless come to an end.
Multiple sources confirm that Jorja Fox &amp;#8212; whose contract expired at the end of last season &amp;#8212; will depart the hit procedural in November, after failing to come to terms on a new long-term deal.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; character, Sara Sidle, survived a harrowing run-in with a killer in Thursday&amp;rsquo;s season premiere, but now it seems Fox is a goner.
Reports at TVGuide.com and EOnline.com yesterday have Fox leaving the crime series in November. Her contract expired in May, and there&amp;rsquo;s been speculation for months that she would exit the show.
Fox was nearly fired in 2004 over a contract dispute.
Word of her departure came just as CBS was celebrating big numbers for Thursday&amp;rsquo;s telecast, which averaged 25.</description>

      <description>There was much speculation about whether or not Sara Sidle would make it out alive from her encounter with &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Miniature Killer. While the season premiere answered that question, the resolution was overshadowed by word that despite surviving, Sara is still not long for the CSI world &amp;hellip; because Jorja Fox, the actress who plays her, will be leaving &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;.
Although it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been definitively confirmed, multiple sources have said that she will be leaving the show this November, after failing to arrive at a resolution for a new contract.</description>

      <description>Sara Sidle is a survivor. The actor that plays her, not so much.
Jorja Fox, who has starred on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; since its inception in 2000, will not complete the series&amp;rsquo; current season, bowing out after the seventh episode in November, E! Online TV columnist Kristin Dos Santos reports.
The news will no doubt be a blow to fans of the actress, albeit not a surprising one.
Her departure comes after rocky contract negotiations offscreen and an onscreen story line that has been foreshadowing for months a less than happy ending for her character.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s outta there.
That&amp;rsquo;s what I can tell you about Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s status on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, the hit series that bested &amp;ldquo;Grey**s in the ratings last night.
As I mentioned on &amp;ldquo;E! News&amp;rdquo; on Wednesday [&amp;hellip;], reliable sources close to the show tell me Jorja will not be a part of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; as of the seventh episode of the current season.
So, do not let the fact that Sara Sidle survived last night&amp;rsquo;s premiere fool you.</description>

      <description>**Jorja Fox Leaving &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;
The actress will appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the top-rated show that made her a household name
&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox &amp;ndash; who was briefly fired from the show in 2004 during an ugly contract dispute with CBS &amp;ndash; is expected to leave the top-rated drama before year&amp;rsquo;s end. A source close to the show confirms that Fox, whose contract expired last season, has agreed to appear in six or seven episodes this year before leaving the show that made her a household name and turned her into an unwilling poster child for greedy TV actors.</description>

      <description>Hollywood actress Jorja Fox is reportedly planning to leave the popular police procedural, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;
E! News has reported that Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, will not be on the show after this season&amp;rsquo;s seventh episode.
TV Guide has also said Fox will be leaving the long-running series in November.
The actress has reportedly been having more trouble negotiating her contract with CBS.

      <description>SARA lives.
Lab tech Sara Sidle sur vived last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger ending of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; fans of the show learned last night in the premiere episode of the series&amp;rsquo; eighth season.
The survival of Sara, who was left to die in the Las Vegas desert by the serial murderer known as &amp;ldquo;the miniature killer&amp;rdquo; - for the miniature models of crime scenes she would build and leave for CSI investigators - means cast member Jorja Fox will be sticking around for a while on the top-rated CBS drama.</description>

      <description>The day finally arrived: &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; fans finally know if Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, survived or not. Last year&amp;rsquo;s finale had the CSI team not only continue their search for the &amp;ldquo;Miniature Killer&amp;rdquo; but also for Sara, who became the killer&amp;rsquo;s last victim. There was a lot of speculation over the summer surrounding Sara&amp;rsquo;s fate especially since the show was doing its best to keep it a secret (fans were told they would at least see Sara under the car in the premiere but didn&amp;rsquo;t say more).</description>

      <description>The eighth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; traverses a tense path that long-time fans of the show will find familiar: a race-against-time CSI team effort to find one of their own, left to die in the desert by a vengeful killer.
Last time this happened, the intended victim was Nick (George Eads), buried alive - but eventually rescued - in an episode directed by Quentin Tarantino. This time, Nick is one of the team members using all his skills and instincts to help his colleague, Sara (Jorja Fox), escape a similar fate.</description>

      <description>The pros and cons on how last season&amp;rsquo;s cliffhanger might end
The seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ended earlier this year with crime scene investigator Sara Sidle trapped under an overturned vintage muscle car, her hand twitching with faint signs of life. Back at the Las Vegas lab, Sara&amp;rsquo;s boss and secret lover, Gil Grissom, finished his interrogation of a psychotic young cleaning woman who turned out to be the lab&amp;rsquo;s season-long nemesis, the Miniature Killer.</description>

      <description>Sara Sidle is carrying a heavy weight on her shoulders these days.
When the eighth season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; opens, Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character will still be where she was at the end of May&amp;rsquo;s finale: stuck under a car in the Nevada desert, courtesy of a psycho killer &amp;#8212; and Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract negotiations with CBS.
But while producers promise to resolve this cliff-hanger one way or another (though they&amp;rsquo;re staying silent about Fox&amp;rsquo;s fate &amp;#8212; hmmm, she&amp;rsquo;s not in the network&amp;rsquo;s cast shot, left), they do say her costars will be carrying their share of dramatic weight this season.</description>

Exit Wounds: Despite talk of Fox&amp;rsquo;s departure, &amp;ldquo;Sara does interact with the killer in the premiere,&amp;rdquo; coexec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells Us -but later adds, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a Kleenex for that episode.

      <description>So what is happening with Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;?
The character appeared to have been crushed under a car as the Season 7 finale ended, and all summer blogs have buzzed with speculation about actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract negotiations with CBS. Does it mean anything that Fox wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a recent &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cast photo in TV Guide?
Sidle, as fans know, was in a relationship with Gil Grissom (William Petersen), and the entire &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; team found out about the romance in the season finale.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation CBS. Thursdays, 9 p.m. Humor and personality distinguish America&amp;rsquo;s favorite scripted series from so many other &amp;ldquo;procedurals,&amp;rdquo; and last season was perhaps its best. When it ended, Grissom&amp;rsquo;s secret girlfriend, Sara, was lying pinned under a car, and rumors abound that Jorja Fox, who plays her, is leaving the show. Sexy Jessica Lucas (&amp;ldquo;Life as We Know It&amp;rdquo;) has been signed as a hotshot new CSI.</description>

If you watch &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; at all, then you are likely aware of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s reported contract difficulties. At the end of this past season, viewers were left with an image of her character, Sara Sidle, trapped under a wrecked sports car in the middle of nowhere. Signs of life were, shall we say, limited. For &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans, the debate has been raging since before the finale ever aired about whether or not Sara would survive the crash.</description>

      <description>Like other actors on the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; franchise, William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) feel fortunate to portray their respective characters and to be part of such an award-winning series.
Petersen, 54, reveals that science was something he was never really good at. But since landing the role of the forensic entomologist, he has developed a keen interest in the field and has seen some surprising changes in his personality.</description>

      <description>Sneak Peek CSI
Instead of using &amp;ldquo;Who Are You?&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s theme song this year, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers might want to consider the Clash&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Should I Stay or Should I Go.&amp;rdquo;
In last spring&amp;rsquo;s season finale, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) was left trapped under a car in the Nevada desert by a serial killer &amp;#8212; with pouring rain threatening to drown her &amp;#8212; while Gil Grissom (William Petersen), her boyfriend and boss, and the rest of the CSIs frantically tried to find her.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; adds new cast member
Jessica Lucas is joining the cast of CBS&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; as a recurring.
She will play Veronica Lake, aka Ronnie, a young, vivacious, smart, sought-after newbie CSI in training who gets multiple job offers but chooses to go to Las Vegas because of the increase in crime rates there.
Ever since the role cropped up on breakdowns around town, it prompted speculation that the character might be groomed as a replacement for Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), who was left crushed under a car with her hand barely moving in the Season 7 finale.</description>

      <description>** Executive producer confirms that Sara Sidle is&amp;hellip;**
[Spoiler Alert!]
&amp;hellip; in the September season premiere.
&amp;ldquo;I hate spoilers,&amp;rdquo; sighs Naren Shankar, co-executive producer and co-showrunner for CSI. He&amp;rsquo;s speaking to me over the phone from Los Angeles, where he and the rest of the CSI writing staff are breaking the story for the CSI/Without a Trace crossover episode.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to flex some writing muscles,&amp;rdquo; Shakar says of the May sweeps storyline while munching on his lunch.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox
She&amp;rsquo;s played a lesbian intern and a forensic investigator. But in her spare time, Jorja Fox is a bit of a surfer-babe.
We were strolling along the sandy shores of Venice Beach, LA, in search of hot surfer chicks when we bumped into rather famous actress and lesbian icon Jorja Fox, fresh from a wave-riding session.
You may know her as the firm but fair Sara Sidle from the popular TV crime series &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

CSI: The decision has not been officially announced yet. The only word I got about it was the rumor saying that she would be back for 1 episode and that&amp;rsquo;s it. POLL TIME!

CSI: 75% of voters want Jorja Fox to remain on the show&amp;hellip; we should soon learn if your wish will be granted.</description>

      <description>On the heels of news that Rory Cochrane is returning to one of the other CSI shows, CSI: Miami, comes this news: Jorja Fox is probably on her way out.
CSI Producer Carol Mendolsohn tells TV Guide&amp;rsquo;s Michael Ausiello that they have just cast a new female lab technician that will be introduced in the third episode, and there are hints that she&amp;rsquo;s not just a new cast member but a new cast member that will take over for Jorja Fox, whose Sara character might die in that car crash.</description>

      <description>Who are you? Looks like &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; producers are making way for a replacement for Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle. A new female character, a CSI or lab tech in her 20s, will turn up in the season&amp;rsquo;s third episode. Sara was last spotted in a car wreck, meaning she probably won&amp;rsquo;t survive. What is known is that Fox will appear in the Sept. 27 season premiere â but under the car.</description>

      <description>Although &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hasn&amp;rsquo;t even pronounced Sara dead yet, it sounds suspiciously like the powers-that-be are already planning to breathe new life into the show by introducing a replacement for Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s hot cop.
Executive producer Carol Mendolsohn has told me exclusively that a new female character will turn up in this season&amp;rsquo;s third episode. &amp;ldquo;[She] may be a CSI or lab tech,&amp;rdquo; the boss said. And, according to my casting spies, the junior detective will be in her mid-twenties, fresh out of college and lacking the capacity for self-censorship.</description>

&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;The Sara-Grissom storyline is going to conclude,&amp;rdquo; Littman says. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t take it in that definitive term. It&amp;rsquo;s very smartly done.&amp;rdquo;
Tell me more.
&amp;ldquo;We have a big storyline finish at the start of the season,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;It will play out for a few episodes. &amp;hellip; The ambition of their [the writers&amp;rsquo;] stories is once again extremely high and extremely quirky. That arc worked so well with Grissom and Sara, that we are going to let these characters breathe this year.</description>

While cast and crew remain tight-lipped on the details, we can reveal that the violent outcome has a major bearing on another of the show&amp;rsquo;s most intriguing storylines &amp;#8212; the clandestine relationship between Grissom and his fiesty colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox).
As the CSI team tries to track down the killer, Sara goes missing and her secret relationship with Grissom is forced into the open.
Whether Sara becomes another victim of the mini-replica killer remains to be seen, especially in the light of speculation over Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s future on the show.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
On CBS&amp;rsquo; CSI, a series that&amp;rsquo;s not too concerned with personal lives, Jorja Fox has made her Sara a tough, world-weary pro who&amp;rsquo;s also a vulnerable woman hopelessly involved with her enigmatic equal, Gil Grissom. Hopefully, her previous shunning by the academy is a crime that Emmy voters will take time to investigate - and solve.

Even while the festival was still in progress, we caught photos of television star Jorja Fox (&amp;ldquo;ER,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;) on one of her major fansites, JorjaAllAround.com. In the photos, Fox was inexplicably dressed in khaki pants worn UNDERNEATH a pretty sundress, posing with Thora Birch, who looked like she had no idea how to stand in front of the &amp;ldquo;red carpet&amp;rdquo; camera.</description>

      <description>Every lesbian&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star, Jorja Fox, isn&amp;rsquo;t your average sexpot. The attractive but geeky tomboy hasn&amp;rsquo;t graced the pages of Vogue, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t spend each episode in impossibly high heels, and you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to find her at a PETA rally protesting animal cruelty than pitching Revlon products to you from a talk show on the Oxygen Network. That&amp;rsquo;s why we love her and her strong, sexy brand of androgyny and even her slightly intoxicating don&amp;rsquo;t-care-to-talk-about-my-personal-life attitude.</description>

Executive Producer Naren Shankar says: I&amp;rsquo;m going to be asked that all summer! My response: Tune in to the season opener. We know where we&amp;rsquo;re going with it. It&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about going from the beginning of this season. We&amp;rsquo;d ended last year with the reveal of Sara and Grissom&amp;rsquo;s relationship and had been doing that dance of who in the lab is going to know.</description>

Way back then, viewers were just coming to terms with his secret relationship with Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). And in the finale, according to Shankar, &amp;ldquo;this is the episode where Grissom goes public about the relationship&amp;rdquo; after Sara suddenly disappears. Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract with the show is up at the end of this season, and the network has no comment on wether she&amp;rsquo;ll be returning next season. Shankar will only admit that the situation Sara finds herself in &amp;ldquo;will have some significant ramifications for her relationship with Grissom.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never watched any of those &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; shows &amp;ndash; except for the Faye Dunaway episode! But, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking out for Jorja Fox, since we&amp;rsquo;re both alums of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC. Alas, the actress&amp;rsquo; future with CSI is in jeopardy. There&amp;rsquo;s the well-documented salary dispute she and co-star George Eads had (they walked out, CBS said fine, they came back without a raise). Now we hear that when the show wanted to film Foxy&amp;rsquo;s death scene, she refused to show up on the set &amp;ndash; smart girl!</description>

      <description>On the election, the online petition site ePetitions has a call for an international commission to investigate Scotland&amp;rsquo;s voting chaos as its top petition yesterday. To show the seriousness of the situation, a petition demanding that the writers of hit TV series CSI do not kill off Las Vegas investigator Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, was beaten into third place.

      <description>As we told you last week, speculation is running rampant about whether Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, will be leaving CSI. Now more possible details have emerged â but are they true? You be the judge.
Beware of possible spoilers for the upcoming season finale, set to air May 17.
Previously it was reported that her character was set to go missing, but this week the New York Post reported that her character was slated to die in a car accident because of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s ongoing contract dispute with the show.</description>

Not going easily&amp;hellip;
[&amp;hellip;]
And &amp;hellip; SPOILER ALERT &amp;hellip; Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s character on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is apparently a goner due to a salary dispute, but she apparently got some revenge by refusing to show up to shoot the death scene.
Her spokesperson says she did eventually show up, but The &amp;ldquo;New York Post&amp;rdquo; says the show had already done an alternate ending.

      <description>Jorja Fox was supposed to die at the end of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; this year - but she has refused to show up for work on the set to film her &amp;ldquo;death scene.&amp;rdquo;
According to reports, the show&amp;rsquo;s execs have been unhappy with the star&amp;rsquo;s salary demands, and decided to kill off her CSI character, Sara Sidle, who&amp;rsquo;s in a secret romance with boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen).
Fox was scheduled to film Sara&amp;rsquo;s death scene late last month, when her character was supposed to be crushed by a car for the May 17 season finale.</description>

Another ongoing storyline this season has been the secret romance between Grissom and Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX). Because of that, Thea, who watched as Billy Petersen interrupted her interview with Marg to plant a big kiss on his co-star&amp;rsquo;s mouth, had to ask where he sees his on-screen romance going.
&amp;ldquo;Grissom and Sara have had a relationship for a while,&amp;rdquo; he points out. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t know for how long and in what way, but they have, obviously, had a relationship for a long time.</description>

Jorja on our minds
That Jorja Fox is one feisty &amp;ldquo;CSI.&amp;rdquo; No wonder Grissom loves her.
According to the &amp;ldquo;Star&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;New York Post&amp;rdquo;, Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit CBS show, was supposed to bite the Las Vegas desert dust in this season&amp;rsquo;s sweeps finale, but she&amp;rsquo;s refused to show up for work to shoot her death scene.
&amp;ldquo;Her contract is up and they are in conversations,&amp;rdquo; said a CBS spokeswoman.</description>

      <description>Jorja has a raise on her mind. The star of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; staged a one-day walkout from the set during the shoot of the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s season finale, which airs May 17. The actress is in talks with producers about a new contract to keep her on the show, sources familiar with the discussions tell TV Guide. How those talks go may decide the result of the cliff-hanging finale in which Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, is struck by an automobile.</description>

Dead Beat: Jorja Fox refuses to play dead. Her character, Sarah Sidle, was supposed to die at the end of this season&amp;rsquo;s CSI. CBS sources say the network decided to kill her off after failing to come to a salary agreement for next season. Only Fox refused to show up on set, meaning expensive reshoots with Marg Helgenberger.

      <description>**Another contract dispute with CBS may mean Sara Sidle is toast **
Here we go again.
In a repeat performance of 2004, Jorja Fox refused to show up on the set of CSI because of a salary dispute with CBS.
The New York Post is reporting that Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle, was being written off the forensics drama because show execs weren&amp;rsquo;t happy with her contract demands, one of which was a &amp;ldquo;major raise&amp;rdquo; from her $100,000 US per episode.</description>

A salary dispute with CBS was at the bottom of the unusual stand-off.
Unhappy with Fox&amp;rsquo;s demands, execs decided to kill off her &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; character, Sara Sidle, who&amp;rsquo;s romantically involved with boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen).</description>

Jorja talked about her ten-and-a-half-year-old Boxer Ali (yes, as in Muhammad Ali), a rescue dog from New York.
The article revealed Fox&amp;rsquo;s soft spot for animals, her childhood dream to have a show on &amp;ldquo;Animal Planet&amp;rdquo; that hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone away and her assistance with the &amp;ldquo;North Central Animal Shelter&amp;rdquo; last year.</description>

      <description>Although many deem the Grissom-Sara love affair to be a significant contributing factor for the intriguing yet forced plot of the show, the couple&amp;rsquo;s fans might need to say goodbye to their on screen romance. Although it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been confirmed or denied by CBS, many speculate that Jorja Fox, actress who plays Sara Sidle on Crime Scene Investigation, will be leaving the Emmy Award-winning CBS television series. According to TV Guide, Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract is up to next month and that she may not renew for the next season.</description>

      <description>Rumors are swirling that CSI is set to kill off Sara Sidle. &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo; is reporting that the Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s contract is up next month and that she may not renew.
&amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo; quotes a source close to the show, &amp;ldquo;Her leaving makes perfect sense. She&amp;rsquo;s been there for seven years, she&amp;rsquo;s made a ton of money, and it allows the show to resolve the Sara-Grissom thing.&amp;rdquo;
On the other hand Fox seems perfectly content and hasn&amp;rsquo;t made any public rumblings about leaving.</description>

      <description>Underneath the crime scenes and forensic labs on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; lays one of the show&amp;rsquo;s most compelling mysteries: the relationship between Gil Grissom, head of the crime lab, and investigator Sara Sidle.
Their relationship, which has been suggested went back years before the series began at a seminar in San Francisco, has evolved from season to season.
And as the seventh season of the show comes to a close, the situation could turn sour for the crime-scene couple.</description>

CSI may be headed toward another contract showdown with its star, Jorja Fox. According to sources, the actress&amp;rsquo;s commitment with the show ends next month and she has yet to sign a new deal, and she may not.
Sources say Fox is itching for those elusive greener pastures and after seven years on the show and millions of dollars in the bank, it might be time for a change. A spokesperson from the show had no comment, but a close look at the show reveals that producers may already be laying the groundwork for her character&amp;rsquo;s exit.</description>

      <description>The first thing that I notice about Jorja Fox is how quick she is to laugh. It&amp;rsquo;s a little disarming, considering her character on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Sara Sidle, is not known for her jovial sense of humor. Disarming, yet infectious and even over the phone, its feels less like an interview and more like we&amp;rsquo;re kicking back a few beers in a local pub and sharing stories.
She talks to PopGurls about the community on CSI, the Grissom/Sara relationship, Eric Szmanda&amp;rsquo;s influence and being homeless in Europe at 17.</description>

      <description>Actress Jorja Fox is a committed environmentalist and animal rights activist. As I&amp;rsquo;ve just seen in an amusing video, she&amp;rsquo;s also really into biking. The clip shows Jorja and SpinDaily host, Katherine, Orange20 Bikes in LA and checking out all the new models &amp;ndash; from hybrid to fixed gear. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty candid take on their time there with Jorja and Katherine performing &amp;ldquo;ride-bys&amp;rdquo; while singing songs. As Cyclelicious points out, there are also some great quotes:</description>

Jorja needs a bike that can carry a surf board on the bike.

      <description>Love makes the TV story line go round.
Without it, the pretty interns would be stuck just treating patients on &amp;ldquo;Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The Office&amp;rdquo; would be a savage satire without any heart.
In honor of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, consider a few top TV couples:

[*]Sara and Grissom on CBS&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; (Thursday at 9 p.m. on WBZ, Ch. 4): It&amp;rsquo;s a little awkward. Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara&amp;rsquo;s (Jorja Fox) relationship was a secret even to the show&amp;rsquo;s fans until last season&amp;rsquo;s kimono-wearing final moments.</description>

Question: Anything on the CSI front regarding Sara-Grissom? &amp;#8212; Penelope
Ausiello: There&amp;rsquo;s a big Sara episode coming up in April in which she gets a little too emotionally involved in a case. Complicating matters is the fact that, unlike most of the show&amp;rsquo;s victims, this one has a pulse.

      <description>Does being too popular do more harm than good? CSI star Jorja Fox says her blessing in disguise was Not Always Fitting In.
&amp;lsquo;Where I grew up, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even close to being cool. My family lived in the smallest, most rural town in Florida, called Melbourne Beach, and it was an outdoors-y community where beauty was all about being tanned and blonde.
But I was chubby, awkward and fair-skinned with dark hair - and a 10p-sized gap between my teeth.</description>

      <description>The CSIer talks about her website, her beliefs, and the possibility that CSI may lose fans because of Liev Schreiber
Jorja Fox is refreshingly forthright, until you ask her about upcoming CSI storylines. But as long as we don&amp;rsquo;t, Fox is willing to talk about anything, including the possibility that fans may tune out while co-star William Petersen is gone from the forensic drama.

      <description>Every young actress with ambition hopes to make it in movies. But if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out the way you wanted, television can be a great alternative for a successful career. A great example of this is Jorja Fox (38).
She has appeared on the hit series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] for six years. Previous, she appeared on two other hit series: [[ER]] and [[The West Wing]].
Anyone who tries to remember her movies, probably comes up with [[Memento]].</description>

Ellen DeGeneres focused on the word itself, telling Extra: &amp;ldquo;This particular word is thrown around all the time at the workplace, at the playground, on the sports field and no one gets outraged. Hopefully this incident will put an end to this and people will stop using this word and other hateful words once and for all.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s hope the insanity stops here, and that Jorja Fox isn&amp;rsquo;t forced to drop by Ellen to tearfully recount the time Gil Grissom called her a &amp;ldquo;greedy rugmuncher&amp;rdquo; upon discovering she ate the last craft service banana.</description>

Speaking of torches, what about the one Grissom carries for Sara? According to Mendelsohn, his departure will cause tension in that relationship, the source of which will become clear in a future episode &amp;#8212; when Grissom will try to make things right by &amp;ldquo;sending Sara (Jorja Fox) something. Fans may remember the last time he did that, it was a plant. So for longtime fans, this will have resonance.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Number one all around the world, CSI is apparently still at the top of its game. One could be forgiven for thinking that after seven seasons and two spin-offs, the genre would have completely lost steam, but that&amp;rsquo;s not taking into account the talent of the writers and the quality of the actors. We went to talk to the team behind the show to find out what they have in store for us in Season seven and how the show has managed to remain as fresh as ever.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox takes time off from playing CSI&amp;rsquo;s forensics investigator Sara Sidle to show us around the set of the hit TV Show
###The crime lab###
&amp;ldquo;We have one of the best equipped labs in the US, even though it&amp;rsquo;s only TV. A lot of the equipment is given to us by the companies that make it, and there&amp;rsquo;s a technical expert with us every day. I could probably use the equipment to fingerprint and identify body fluids, but most other things vanish from my brain as soon as I do them.</description>

Last spring, in the last minute of the last episode of the season, Grissom (William Petersen) looked up from his bedtime reading at Sara (Jorja Fox) in the bathroom door, fresh from a shower. All this reticent fall, they haven&amp;rsquo;t touched and barely smiled, but their intimacy has a resounding vibe.

The seventh season of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; has been a tumultuous one. So far, investigator Greg Sanders has been nearly beaten to death while Catherine Willows not only dealt with her daughter&amp;rsquo;s kidnapping but also with her father&amp;rsquo;s murder.

      <description>As forensic sleuth Sara Sidle on the hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox has had her share of murders to solve. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a professional to figure out who the perpetrator is behind the deaths of the billions of animals killed for food every year &amp;#8212; namely, the meat industry. That&amp;rsquo;s why Jorja &amp;#8212; a longtime vegetarian &amp;#8212; jumped at the chance to shoot a provocative new pro-vegetarian ad for her friends at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia-Pacific.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;My six-pack is not like most actresses&amp;rsquo; &amp;#8212; my six-pack is beer.&amp;rdquo;
From gritty crime scenes to sexy love scenes, JORJA FOX&amp;rsquo;s role on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has been through a lot of changes due to her new romance.
WITH HER TOMBOYISH demeanor and love of rock music, surfing, beer and dogs, no one, least of all actress Jorja Fox, would have predicted that she&amp;rsquo;d be in one of the most talked-about love affairs on TV this season.</description>

      <description>Translated from French
The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What&amp;rsquo;s going to happen in season seven?
The producers keep it secret. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven&amp;rsquo;t though about killing Sara. She&amp;rsquo;s had almost everything else happen to her &amp;#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating &amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s been the team&amp;rsquo;s scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
It&amp;rsquo;s as if those procedural dramas, after spending years putting female crime victims through the wringer (and inside locked cages and under floorboards) have run out of ideas and moved on to harassing female crime fighters instead.
Yet it&amp;rsquo;s also the case that many shows &amp;#8212; facing softening ratings after many years on the air or tougher time-slot competition &amp;#8212; are attempting to inject more personal story lines into a genre that once regarded them like germs in the crime lab.</description>

      <description>If the revelation that Sara (Jorja Fox) and Gil (William Petersen) are having an affair came as a surprise to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans in May&amp;rsquo;s season finale, it was a surprise that was a long time coming. And not just because there have been little hints along the way.
Jorja Fox said that when she auditioned for the role of Sara, the &amp;ldquo;tiny little character description &amp;hellip; suggested that she was a love interest for the character of Gil Grissom.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s played Sara Sidle in the hit American forensics drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for six years, but Jorja Fox says she still isn&amp;rsquo;t bored with the role.
Unfortunately though, some of her scenes still make her stomach turn, which is a bit of a problem for someone playing a forensic scientist.
&amp;ldquo;I had a bit of an epiphany about it this year. I&amp;rsquo;m not squeamish in general and I realised that it&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m looking at that makes me squeamish, it&amp;rsquo;s the why and the how.</description>

LOVE, EXCITING AND IN THE WORKS FOR A REALLY LONG TIME: The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-finale shocker that Gil Grissom (William L. Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) are an item wasn&amp;rsquo;t a spur-of-the-moment fling. It&amp;rsquo;s been in the works for six years, Fox said at the Television Critics Association&amp;rsquo;s summer meeting.

      <description>For her part, Fox says she was &amp;ldquo;thrilled&amp;rdquo; to get the script pages with that intimate scene between Grissom and Sidle.
&amp;ldquo;I had sort of been gearing up from the beginning of the show that that might happen,&amp;rdquo; she told critics during the press session, noting that it&amp;rsquo;s never been entirely clear, even to those who work on the show, whether the two were an item before either arrived in Las Vegas to work as crime scene investigators.</description>

In the season-ending cliffhanger, the two were exposed as secret lovers.

Jorja Fox says of her storyline: &amp;ldquo;The idea right now going into season seven, if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken, is that Grissom and Sara are the only people, and the beautiful audience, that know this is actually taking place.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation caught almost everyone off guard in the season finale when it was revealed that Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle, the characters played by William L. Petersen and Jorja Fox, have had a thing going on for goodness knows how long.
Who knew?
Actually, Fox did. Given that the series has been almost all business, it might seem the detour into romance is a reaction to the move of Grey&amp;rsquo;s Anatomy into the Thursday-night-at-9 time slot this fall.</description>

CSI: Pasadena Since I took the liberty of skipping the CBS Digital Media Presentation (sorry; just say the word &amp;ldquo;multiplatform&amp;rdquo; to yourself about 75 times, and I swear it&amp;rsquo;ll be just like you were there), the last session of the day was for Television&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 Drama. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch this program (because I figure enough people do), so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what sorts of significant things were said. Jorja Fox is happy that her character, Sara, kissed William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character, Grissom.</description>

The loyal audience of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; appears to be split 50-50 between approving this past season&amp;rsquo;s developing Gil Grissom-Sara Sidle romantic relationship, while the other half wants the show to focus on the forensic cases, said Jorja Fox, who plays Sara.
Since &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has focused so much on the procedural elements, &amp;ldquo;there are so many interesting stories we could still show&amp;rdquo; on the emotional side.
Fox has been with the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; since its second episode, but notes the Grissom-Sidle romance has been in the work for the past six seasons.</description>

      <description>Romance is on the cards for Sara and Grissom after a night of passion
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a headless corpse and the near-death of a colleague to get you in the mood for romance. At least this week that is how it seems in this week&amp;rsquo;s episode of US drama CSI.
In the final episode of the sixth series, Grissom is relaxing in his bedroom, when who should emerge from his bathroom wearing nothing except a silky robe and a warm smile but his colleague Sara Sidle!</description>

The names of Saskatchewan babies suggest 2005 was a good year for the TV show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
While data from the province&amp;rsquo;s vital statistics bureau shows Madison, Emma, Emily and Olivia topped the list of Saskatchewan baby girl names last year, the oddly spelled Jorja made its appearance on the list at No. 30.
Twenty-four baby girls share their name with Jorja Fox, the sleuthing brunette actress who plays Sara Sidle on the popular forensics show.</description>

      <description>Question: Hey, Matt! I love your column and just wanted to say, as a sci-fi fan, I appreciate all the attention you give to those great yet underappreciated shows. Now to my question. What are your thoughts on TV&amp;rsquo;s growing trend of hooking up every character on a show with each other? I&amp;rsquo;ll use CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as an example because of the fuss the season finale created. The show was great because it focused on the stories and not the characters.</description>

      <description>CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION stars MARG HELGENBERGER and JORJA FOX will be showing off their singing skills as a duo at an upcoming charity concert. The actresses are reportedly working on a rendition of BEN E KING&amp;rsquo;s STAND BY ME for the fourth annual What A Pair benefit, which raises cash for breast cancer charities. Helgenberger, whose mother is a breast cancer survivor, is a longtime supporter of the event which, this year, will also feature the vocal talents of actresses JESSICA BIEL, LEA THOMPSON and JOELY FISHER.</description>

**Sara and Grissom have been having an affair for a long time on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;: ** See, I thought Brass&amp;rsquo; near death experience was a wake up call to Grissom but many of you think those two star-crossed lovers have been having an affair for awhile. They&amp;rsquo;ve just been keeping it from us (kind of like how we didn&amp;rsquo;t know about Sam and Jack on &amp;ldquo;Without a Trace&amp;rdquo;). I like this idea.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s been working in some of the best shows on US TV for a full decade - ER and The West Wing among them. But it&amp;rsquo;s CSI which has made her a household name. We spoke to the actress on set of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular show.
How is Season Six coming along?
It&amp;rsquo;s flying by - it&amp;rsquo;s almost over, which is weird, they go so fast now. The first couple of years you feel like three years of your life have passed when you finish a season, and now we blink and we&amp;rsquo;ve got five shows left or something.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox aka Sara Sidle:
SHOOTING STARS OCT. 13, 2005
It deals with a bunch of kids that end up in a cult, and a spaceship is supposed to come get them. I loved that it had a little bit of mysticism in it. One of the scenes involves this girl who ends up in this abandoned barn. All of a sudden, the whole place starts to turn into white light and the barn starts to shake.</description>

      <description>In CSI she&amp;rsquo;s the ice cool utterly dedicated slightly grungy Sara Sidle but in real life Jorja Fox, 37, is far warmer with a passion for Blighty and in particular London. Revealing her anglophile leanings, she tells TV plus &amp;ldquo;I love London, it&amp;rsquo;s great I&amp;rsquo;m loving the walking thing and the street energy of London the diversity and most of the people are really educated, cool and hip.
CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox is passionate about Britain and in particular the beer.</description>

      <description>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation is the US&amp;rsquo;s Number One Show and has proved a Global hit, including here in the UK.
What does it mean to star Jorja Fox, 37, who plays Sara Sidle?
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea&amp;rdquo; she gasps. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing we play in all but four countries in the planet and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to process that. I just go about my life and sometimes people say hello, and that&amp;rsquo;s a really nice feeling.</description>

CSI
(CBS)
Rating: * * *
The finale word: Last year, CSI broke out of its normal pattern for a two-part finale that buried Nick alive. This year&amp;rsquo;s solid finale stuck closer to the show&amp;rsquo;s extremely popular formula - and yet it seemed to send many fans into a frenzy.
The fuss was not over the fate of a critically wounded Capt. Brass, perhaps because no one really thought his fate was in doubt.</description>

      <description>That sound you heard at 9 p.m. on May 18 was collective gasping from millions of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; fans as they watched an intimate scene from the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale, in which Gil Grissom (William Petersen) chatted casually with co-worker Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) &amp;#8212; in a bedroom.
The two investigators are in a relationship, executive producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms. And it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;not so new.&amp;rdquo;
She says the show&amp;rsquo;s many law-enforcement contacts say that those who work in the crime field are often attracted to each other, due to shared experiences and interests.</description>

      <description>One of the stars of the US&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama CSI speaks out&amp;hellip;
AS SARA SIDLE, one of the crack forensics experts in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja Fox gets to wade through human body parts to solve murders. The show has two spin-off series, and is set to return for its seventh year in the US in September.
Did you think the show would become such a huge hit?
When I read the script for CSI, it was like a trance I fell under.</description>

      <description>For a season finale, the series leaves viewers on a sour note and cranks up the cheese more than usual
You expect a certain amount of cheese when you watch CSI, but the season finale &amp;ldquo;Way To Go,&amp;rdquo; was much worse than usual. There were a number of lines, which I like to call groaners, that were added to get a laugh, but instead caused me to audibly groan to ease the pain inflicted by terrible writing.</description>

After the surgery, Brass pulls through. Everyone is happy. It&amp;rsquo;s how the episode ended that left me asking questions. Grissom was lying in bed talking about how he&amp;rsquo;d like to die. He wants cancer so he has time to plan out and enjoy his last few months. At first I thought he was talking to himself&amp;hellip; which I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put past Gil. But then Sara walked out of the bathroom wearing a white silk bathrobe!</description>

      <description>Modest to a fault, Jorja Fox is gracious about what many would call the burden of fame and relentless scrutiny by the public that comes when starring on TV&amp;rsquo;s top rated show. CBS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;In general, I&amp;rsquo;m only surprised that people want to hear what I have to say at all, about anything,&amp;rdquo; she laughs. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m always, you want to interview me? OK. Sure!&amp;rdquo;
But Fox doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about her fabulous television career, doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to pose for the cameras in yet another glamorous photo shoot.</description>

      <description>CSI Colleagues Aren&amp;rsquo;t Just Pals
For years, fans of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; have been wondering: Is there more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye?&amp;rdquo; In the May 17 episode, we found out that the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
But now we have even more questions . and, as it turns out, so do the show&amp;rsquo;s stars. *The Early Show* co-anchor Julie Chen talked to the cast of the CBS primetime drama about their characters&amp;rsquo; futures.</description>

      <description>Oh snap! &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; better watch out. It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale (warning, don&amp;rsquo;t read this if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; season-ender yet):
I got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: &amp;ldquo;The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a &amp;#8216;Bizarro World CSI,&amp;rsquo; as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death.</description>

      <description>Holy schnike! The nookie is confirmed! While seeing a shot of Sara in a robe coming over to our dear Gil in bed certainly was no great surprise, it still made my heart race. I was kind of hoping the long, drawn-out pan around the room and the true answer to &amp;ldquo;GG + ?&amp;rdquo; would lead us to something more shocking (like Brass&amp;rsquo; daughter, maybe), but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see this ending as well.</description>

Ausiello: Not sure what the cut on Nick&amp;rsquo;s neck means, but the badge is definitely a big clue and, based on the hints Jorja Fox dropped in last week&amp;rsquo;s AA, I&amp;rsquo;m betting the &amp;ldquo;GG + ?</description>

The pair played during a semifinal game last night at a field in North Hollywood, and TMZ was there to capture it.</description>

      <description>Will CSI Have a Cow Over Fox Spot?
Prime-time sleuth Jorja Fox is keeping a pretty meaty secret from her bosses at CSI: She recently posed for a pro-vegetarian ad for animal rights group PETA. No big deal, except the ad-which will be unveiled May 11 in LA-relies heavily on her CSI connection. Perhaps too heavily. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really ask for permission, which I probably should have,&amp;rdquo; confesses Fox, a longtime vegetarian.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on the hit TV show CSI, manages to make dusting for fingerprints, collecting DNA, and examining cadavers look like the hottest job around. Now, Fox hopes to generate the same amount of buzz for vegetarianism as she has for forensic science. In her new ad for PETA, Fox encourages people to &amp;ldquo;investigate vegetarianism&amp;rdquo;-something she&amp;rsquo;s been doing for 20 years.
&amp;ldquo;[I]f you just cut down [on meat] or tried [vegetarianism], you might find that you love it,&amp;rdquo; Fox says in her exclusive interview with PETA.</description>

Question: Some CSI forums are saying you&amp;rsquo;re completely full of it because you said you were 99 percent sure there would be no Grissom-Sara stuff in the season finale. But there are spoilers floating around that say there will be. What&amp;rsquo;s really going on? Your reputation is on the line here! &amp;#8212; Jamie&amp;lt; Ausiello: I&amp;rsquo;ve read those spoilers, too, and all I can say is thank god I didn&amp;rsquo;t say I was 100 percent certain.</description>

      <description>The CSI team shows up for a wedding and stays for a murder on tonight&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; airing at 9 p.m. on CBS. The action begins when Grissom (WILLIAM PETERSEN), Nick Stokes (GEORGE EADS), Sara Sidle (JORJA FOX) and Captain Jim Brass (PAUL GUILFOYLE) attend a wedding at which the groom&amp;rsquo;s mother is murdered.
&amp;ldquo;It is a fascinating, sort of character-driven, dark comedy which we rarely do,&amp;rdquo; Jorja tells ET.</description>

      <description>Farm critters don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about their future at the Animal Acres shelter.
It&amp;rsquo;s a typical day at the animal shelter &amp;#8212; Bagel is getting a good belly rub. Roscoe and Kirby are receiving pats and scratches on their heads. And Sophia and Precious Moment are being softly stroked as they nestle closer to humans.
Dogs? Cats? Bunnies? No, they&amp;rsquo;re farm animals, namely pigs, cows and turkeys &amp;#8212; and they&amp;rsquo;re having a great time.</description>

Ausiello: Does sexual subtext qualify as &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; in your book? Because you&amp;rsquo;re gonna get heaps of it in the May 4 episode when someone with unbelievable powers of perception picks up on the heat between G-S &amp;#8212; and promptly calls them on it.</description>

      <description>JORJA FOX (CSI, Five, 9pm)
Age: 37.
Style: Fox by name &amp;hellip;
Significant others: Just her two cats and a dog.
Finest hour: Landing the role of CSI&amp;#8216;s Sara Sidle, straight after making the hit movie Memento.
Don&amp;rsquo;t mention: Pay rises. In 2004, Jorja and one of her CSI co-stars, George Eads, were fired from the show. Both denied they were holding out for more monet, and claimed their sackings were down to several misunderstandings.</description>

Season 5 is perhaps the shows most successful year to date. It&amp;rsquo;s always been a ratings winner - ever since the &amp;ldquo;Pilot&amp;rdquo; - but it&amp;rsquo;s clear from watching the fifth series that the producers have grown supremely confident. The budget seems even higher than before, helping CSI to match (or, in some cases, exceed) your average crime movie. The formula has become routine, and audiences know exactly what to expect.</description>

J is for Jorja. Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, and co-star George Eads were sacked from the show over a pay dispute that delayed the start of filming on the fifth series. The pair had argued for a pay increase but were later re-hired on the old salary - &amp;pound;50,000 per episode.

      <description>Jorja Fox has seen her character Sara Sidle go through a lot over the five and a half years &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; has been on the air, but the 6th season has been less tumultuous for Sara, even allowing her to help Nick Stokes (George Eads) as he grapples with the fallout from his ordeal in Grave Danger. Fox took the time to sit down with CSI Files to discuss the reunited CSI team, her complicated reactions to the team split in the previous season and Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationships with the other characters on the show.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rsquo;s *sexiest vegetarian on snatching (fake) bodies, carrying a torch for Grissom and the show&amp;rsquo;s all-star band.*
During her six years as a Las Vegas CSI, your character Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s life has been anything but idle. Was it tough becoming a walking tabloid? A couple seasons back, she was almost blown up. She got a DUI. Her boyfriend dumped her. Grissom [William Petersen] sort of dumped her. She had authority issues and I was wondering if she was always going to have them.</description>

D | Double-Ups Ever find yourself puzzled (or elated) when a particular CSI episode features, say, only Grissom (William Petersen) and Nick (George Eads), and is followed the next week by one about only Sara (Jorja Fox) and Catherine (Helgenberger)? Such character divisions occasionally happen because of a production double-up &amp;#8212; when the show&amp;rsquo;s scheduling demands require the series to shoot two episodes simultaneously.

      <description>As CSI&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle, she has her hands full of blood, bugs and rotting parts &amp;#8212; but Fox&amp;rsquo;s passion for acting gives her the stomach to cope, as she explains to Jenny.
Over the last five years, CSI has been responsible for some of TV&amp;rsquo;s goriest scenes. From bone cracking autopsies to flesh piercing special effects and horrific murders, there.s no holding back when it comes to blood and guts. Yet star Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, admits that after five years the realistic looking bodies can still ruin her stomach.</description>

      <description>On Nov. 19, Animal Acres, LA&amp;rsquo;s newly opened farm animal sanctuary, will celebrate Thanksgiving with a unique celebration called the &amp;ldquo;Feed A Turkey Ceremony&amp;rdquo; at the sanctuary in Acton, Calif.
At noon, special guests actresses Daryl Hannah and Jorja Fox (from the No. 1 hit television show CSI) will be helping feed the turkeys and speaking about the need to protect ALL animals from cruelty and neglect. Daryl and Jorja, who are vegetarians, are LA&amp;rsquo;s leading celebrity advocates for animals, and their support of Animal Acres is opening hearts and minds to the plight of turkeys and other farm animals.</description>

In Thursday night&amp;rsquo;s episode, the sexual tension also continues between Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Gil Grissom (William Peterson).
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;d throw him out of my bed,&amp;rdquo; Fox says. &amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;m certainly not chasing him anymore. I think Sara&amp;rsquo;s done with sort of actively trying to pursue Grissom. But, I still think that the window is open if he came to her in several episodes and said that he wanted to start something.</description>

*CSI* PUTS SEX SCENE TO BED
It&amp;rsquo;s not often that CSI mixes business with pleasure, so when exec producer Carol Mendelsohn revealed in the September 25th issue of TV GUIDE that Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) would &amp;ldquo;spend the night together&amp;rdquo; while out of town working on a possible quadruple-murder case, fans took notice. They also took notice when the episode aired on October 20, and there were three body bags but no naked bodies.</description>

Ausiello: There&amp;rsquo;s a really good explanation for this, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to let exec producer Carol Mendelsohn give it to you. &amp;ldquo;Billy had a death in the family and the script was rewritten to accommodate his absence,&amp;rdquo; she says.</description>

Ausiello: It&amp;rsquo;s not Catherine. At least I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is. It appears producers are heading toward a Sara-Grissom-Sofia triangle instead. Next month, Grissom and Sofia (new series regular Louise Lombard) will share a heart-to-heart in his office, when Sara walks in and thinks she&amp;rsquo;s interrupting something more intimate.</description>

The crush rears its ugly head again: When Grissom and Sara were processing the upstairs of the Lesters&amp;rsquo; house, there was an awkward moment when Sara said, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to sleep in the same bed to have sex. Or to have romance.&amp;rdquo; Grissom couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get out of that room fast enough. Of course, this scene brings up another question I&amp;rsquo;ve had about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; forever: Why do these guys always use their flashlights instead of just turning on the lights?</description>

      <description>What can you tell me about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox?
Larry Phillips, Bellbrook, Ohio
She grew up &amp;ldquo;a child of the &amp;lsquo;70s&amp;rdquo; in a Florida seaside community. She still loves the ocean, surfing and the outdoors. She played Doris Day&amp;rsquo;s role in her high school production of &amp;ldquo;Pillow Talk&amp;rdquo; and went to New York at 16 to model. She&amp;rsquo;s 37, a guitar player and singer, and she&amp;rsquo;s part of a group of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cast and crew members who spend their lunchtime making music.</description>

      <description>What a difference a year (not to mention a coffin, a crazed killer and hundreds of fire ants) has made for CSI.
Last season was a rocky one, both behind and in front of the camera, whether it was one of the stars reportedly being fired and rehired after a contract spat or the show&amp;rsquo;s investigative team suddenly splintering into two squads. Then along came the sizzling season finale, which reunited the teams in order to save a kidnapped Nick (George Eads), who faced certain death trapped in an insect-filled casket.</description>

As a result, the opportunity to star in a TV show came soon after. Although [Emily Proctor] was having a great time on The West Wing, the lure of being a regular cast member in CSI: Miami was hard to resist. She consulted with her friend, former West Wing cast mate Jorja Fox (who plays Sara Sidle in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation), before accepting the part.
&amp;ldquo;Jorja and I have been friends for years since we did a movie together (called Forever Fabulous),&amp;rdquo; she reveals in a charming Southern accent.</description>

[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, on using her scriptwriting experience to come up with an episode: &amp;ldquo;I was almost going to get to write a script in Season Four. And then I ended up doing a play with my theatre company all year. So I was the one who slacked on that opportunity. Next year, maybe.</description>

Meanwhile, Sara has her own share of men to deal with as well. On one hand, there is Grissom, emotionally distant and much older, and on the other is Greg, the young guy who had a crush on Sara a while back.
&amp;ldquo;Haven&amp;rsquo;t we all had crushes at work? Sara has always placed Grissom on a pedestal,&amp;rdquo; reasons Mendelsohn. &amp;ldquo;We found out this season that she didn&amp;rsquo;t have a father figure because her mother murdered her father.</description>

However, a more tangible problem that reality television has caused is a heavy increase in unemployment among actors and production crews. I was able to speak with two actresses, Jorja Fox of C.S.I. and Sami Reade an actress with 15 years of experience. They discussed how the changes have affected them and members of the acting and production community.
Jorja Fox explained how many actors, crew members, and writers have lost their jobs.</description>

JORJA FOX took a huge gamble when she left the critically acclaimed West Wing to try out for the CSI pilot. Although she was fascinated by the script, the talented actress was convinced the fledgling series would get cancelled after only eight episodes. Fortunately, Fox&amp;rsquo;s prediction was wrong, but looking back she wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure she had nailed the role of crime investigator Sara Sidle.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Petersen and several of the members of his cast, such as Marg Helgenberger and Gary Dourdan, have been openly critical of the two CSI spinoffs, saying they dilute the brand. Matters got worse when two of the original CSI actors, Jorja Fox and George Eads, were fired (and then rehired) by CBS boss Les Moonves for making excessive wage demands. Hostility heightened between the show&amp;rsquo;s financiers (CBS and Toronto-based co-producer Alliance Atlantis) and its cast, half of whom got raises while the remainder did not, leaving more than a few bruised egos.</description>

Question: I keep hearing rumors about a CSI episode taking place in London. Any truth? - Shelly
Ausiello: Yes and no. It was planned originally for November sweeps, but then all the cast upheaval squeezed the schedule and made it impossible. So, not only did George and Jorja screw themselves out of a raise, but their antics cost them - and their costars - a free trip across the pond as well.</description>

However, his scenes are significant, marking one of the rare occasions in which CSI goes home with a character to peel back layers of personality.
In the episode, Grissom visits the apartment of suspended subordinate Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) to ask why the abuse case triggered an outburst that endangered her job.</description>

      <description>Here are 10 good reasons why the babe factor plays a big part in solving crimes, writes David Campbell.
What is it about women and crime that kept blokes glued to their TV sets night after night watching the many American whodunits that dominated our screens (and our most-watched lists) during 2004?

 My friend and I sat next to Jorja Fox while dining at Eagle &amp;ldquo;Silverlake-in-Training&amp;rdquo; Rock vegetarian eatery Fatty&amp;rsquo;s at about 2pm on Sunday. (which makes sense since Jorja is a well-known vegetarian.) She was with a female, Punky Brewster looking non-famous friend. Jorja wasn&amp;rsquo;t wearing makeup, looking pretty, but very normal. She was dressed in a khaki sweater, black tshirt and jeans, Tall and very skinny in a non-anorexic, super metabolism way.</description>

      <description>Hey, CSI fans! You die-hards may remember Sarah Buxton from the &amp;ldquo;Eleven Angry Jurors&amp;rdquo; episode that aired last January. She played Lana, a Las Vegas stripper who served her jury duty with a heapin&amp;rsquo; helping of sass on the side. In fact, Ms. Buxton&amp;rsquo;s resum&amp;amp;e reads like a laundry list of shady-lady roles &amp;#8212; go-go girls, hookers, home-wreckers and other miscellaneous temptresses &amp;#8212; in films, prime-time TV and daytime soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of our Lives.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; actress Jorja Fox is looking back on her and cast mate George Eads&amp;rsquo; temporary firing from the show as &amp;ldquo;a very bad dream that lingered. You think, &amp;#8216;This can&amp;rsquo;t really be happening,&amp;rsquo; but it is.&amp;rdquo;
In her first interview since the highly publicized souring of the actors&amp;rsquo; contract renegotiations, Fox tells us she feels she and Eads have been unfairly slammed by some of the media  and that much of what has been reported about the dispute and its resolution has been inaccurate.</description>

      <description>LOS ANGELES (Zap2it.com) It looks like we can finally close the book on the past week of &amp;ldquo;As &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; Turns.&amp;rdquo;
CBS and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star George Eads reached an agreement Friday (July 23) that will allow Eads back on the series, a little more than a week after he was fired in a contract dispute.
So, despite much back-and-forth talk about contracts and oversleeping and the like, it turns out television&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated drama series will begin its fifth season with cast intact.</description>

      <description>Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, says a &amp;ldquo;misunderstanding&amp;rdquo; caused her not to show up for work last week.
According to published reports, Fox was axed after she failed to meet a CBS-imposed deadline pledging, in writing, that she would continue to report for work despite whatever contractual issues she might have.
Fox was said to be &amp;ldquo;mystified&amp;rdquo; because she believed she&amp;rsquo;d mailed her &amp;ldquo;pledge&amp;rdquo; letter in on time.
&amp;ldquo;E! News Live&amp;rdquo; was the first to update the Fox situation when it reported that she will definitely return to the show.</description>

      <description>George Eads and Jorja Fox have been sacked from C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation for breach of contract.
The pair were sacked after they failed to show up for work on Thursday (15th), the first day of production on the crime drama&amp;rsquo;s fifth season.
According to reports, the no-show was a deliberate tactic as part of an ongoing pay dispute with CBS.
The duo were seeking raises from their previous salary, estimated at $100,000 an episode.</description>

Fox will be back on the set of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; when the show resumes production next week, insiders said. The actress was axed last week when CBS execs believed she had failed to comply with a request to sign a letter stating she had no plans to skip work while she and several other thesps sought raises.</description>

      <description>Both George Eads and Jorja Fox are expecting to still be part of the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation cast for the fifth season, stating their firings last week was one big misunderstanding. CBS reportedly let the two actors go for breach of contract. Reports said they had asked for more money to stay on the show.
Eads, who played Nick Stokes on the popular show, tells the Associated Press that the reason he didn&amp;rsquo;t show up on-time the first day of filming was because he overslept.</description>

      <description>Are CSI&amp;rsquo;s casualties about to return from the dead?
Jorja Fox, axed last week from TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama, will return to the scene of the crime and rejoin the show, sources tell E! News Live.
Fellow fired costar George Eads will stage a similar comeback-or so he hopes. Speaking to TV critics in Los Angeles Wednesday, Eads called his dismissal &amp;ldquo;a big misunderstanding,&amp;rdquo; the Associated Press reported.
CBS had no comment Wednesday.</description>

      <description>ALARM CLOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE: Fired CSI actor George Eads claims he missed work last week because he simply overslept. &amp;ldquo;They think it&amp;rsquo;s about money and it&amp;rsquo;s not,&amp;rdquo; Eads told reporters at the TCA press tour in L.A., where he was promoting TNT&amp;rsquo;s Evel Knievel film. &amp;ldquo;I overslept.

      <description>Two dismissed &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;ers learned the hard way:
Everybody really does love &amp;ldquo;Raymond.&amp;rdquo;
The firing of two &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; stars in a salary dispute was fair and intended to help the TV industry draw the fiscal line, CBS chief Les Moonves said Sunday.
Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes on the hit CBS crime drama, were dumped last week when they failed to report for work on the upcoming season, he said.</description>

      <description>Walking off the set or halting production of a new season is nothing new to the television industry. It&amp;rsquo;s a right of passage, a game to play, in the struggle of actor contract negotiations. Just this year, the six principal voices of the Simpson&amp;rsquo;s characters halted production demanding an increase in salary from $125,000 per episode to $360,000.
[&amp;hellip;]
However last week, the balance of power shifted back to CBS and all the studios with the firing of actors George Eads and Jorja Fox who play play investigators Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle on the hit CBS crime drama CSI, as Les Moonves, CBS chief, called the duo&amp;rsquo;s bluff.</description>

      <description>Axed CSI actors George Eads and Jorja Fox look set to be reinstated on the cast of the crime drama, according to reports today.

      <description>ACTOR Jorja Fox has been sacked from the hit TV drama CSI just a day before filming was due to begin on a new series.
It is thought she was fired after a dispute over her pay.
Fox, who played Sara Sidle in the drama, was five years into a seven-year contract with the CBS network. CSI is regularly Australia&amp;rsquo;s most watched TV show.
Fox, 36, previously starred in ER as Dr Maggie Doyle and in a season of The West Wing as Gina Toscano.</description>

Two popular regulars, George Eads and Jorja Fox, prominent since the beginning, were dismissed when they sought salary increases and declined to report for work.
The man who said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re fired,&amp;rdquo; Leslie Moonves, co-president and co-chief operating officer of Viacom, CBS&amp;rsquo; parent, was blunt Sunday.
&amp;ldquo;We feel it&amp;rsquo;s very important that it&amp;rsquo;s time people realize that a contract is a contract,&amp;rdquo; he said.</description>

      <description>We have disquieting news for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation fans.
Jorja Fox and George Eads, two of the stars of CBS&amp;rsquo;s hyper-literate police drama, have been fired for breach of contract. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the actors had been in a dispute over their salaries.
We find CBS&amp;rsquo;s move particularly lame, not only because we find Fox to be charming (she&amp;rsquo;s got an exquisitely complex face whose slightest gesture tells a whole story), but also because her character, Sara Sidle, has had some serious chemistry with head CSI dude Gil Grissom (William L.</description>

      <description>It could be another gruesome CSI crime scene. Except this one doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve dead bodies. Just axed actors.
George Eads and Jorja Fox, who played two of the younger, hotter forensics experts you&amp;rsquo;ll find poking around a corpse, have been whacked from TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama series, Daily Variety first reported on its Website Thursday.
The firings came after both Eads and Fox reportedly made it known to their bosses that, in the tradition of employees everywhere, they&amp;rsquo;d like to make more money.</description>

      <description>Blood is on the floor at &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;: CBS has fired thesps George Eads and Jorja Fox from the hit Eye drama for breach of contract.
Eye toppers Leslie Moonves and Nancy Tellem, apparently drawing a line in their sand, made the decision after Eads &amp;#8212; looking for a pay hike &amp;#8212; failed to show up to work Thursday, the first day of production on the new season of the skein. Fox reported to duty, but insiders said her reps had been asking for more coin, and the Eye acted after Fox failed to reply to a letter asking her if she had any plans to not show up to work.</description>

      <description>Stage fright: Jorja Fox and Heather Reid are getting nervous, but it&amp;rsquo;s more of that superexcited, can&amp;rsquo;t-wait-for-people-to-see kind of nervous. On Thursday, they&amp;rsquo;re hoping lots of people will see their new show, &amp;ldquo;Dear Bernard.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s an original musical the duo is presenting courtesy of Honeypot Prods., a grass-roots theater company they launched with a group of friends eight years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s the biggest production yet and the first one to hit a real stage (the previous productions played to backyard audiences at the homes of generous friends, off-limits to agents, managers and attorneys).</description>

      <description>Call it the case of the missing cast member. &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star Jorja Fox didn&amp;rsquo;t show up to film a pivotal cliff-hanger scene in LA on April 20 in which her character, Sara, is in a car wreck, claims an insider. &amp;ldquo;Producers were unable to find her,&amp;rdquo; claims an insider, adding that the scene had to be shot with a &amp;ldquo;blood-covered stand-in.&amp;rdquo; Jorja was fired &amp;#8212; and quickly rehired &amp;#8212; from &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in 2004 when she held out for a pay increase right before the show&amp;rsquo;s fifth season.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox once starred as a rooster in the children&amp;rsquo;s classics Chicken Little. She was five years old and liked being on stage so much that she became fixated on an acting career. Three decades down the track and New York City-born Fox,36, now ranks among the most popular TV actors in the US. The rooster role, she says, will never be reprised. &amp;ldquo;I dropped out of the play, actually,&amp;rdquo; a giggling Fox told TV Guide in Los Angeles.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a battle royal going on behind the scenes at CSI: Crime Scene Investigation &amp;#8212; should Gil Grissom leap into the sack with Sara Sidle?
Fans of TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated show, now in its fourth season, think it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty hot drama. But backstage fights over what should happen between the characters played by William Petersen and Jorja Fox make the on-screen happenings seem like winter in Antarctica, say insiders.
&amp;ldquo;The production team has been torn apart,&amp;rdquo; a source says.</description>

From copssister: Any scoop on CSI?
The scuttlebutt going around is that producers are planning for Grissom and Sara to hookity-hook it, but that stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox have conflicting opinions on whether they want to. She does; he doesn&amp;rsquo;t.

Question:
I enjoy your column, but I had to throw my two cents in on the
CSI romance issue. I think you were hasty in saying that a pairing
would be disastrous. The show already deals with a tremendous amount of
non-case driven material &amp;mdash; just look at how Catherine Willows is
portrayed: single mother (as is mentioned almost every episode), former
stripper, has a murdered, violent ex-husband, her possible father may be a</description>

      <description>Question: Okay, what is up with CSI? In the beginning it was no romance,
strictly science. Well now, all the hype is that Gil and Sara are going to
fall in love, or whatever they&amp;rsquo;re saying. I mean, what about the finale?
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they have Gil tell Sara about his surgery, if the master plan is
to have them together? Why would he tell Catherine if really he wants to be</description>

      <description>ONE question romantically inclined TV audiences never tire of asking is &amp;ldquo;Will they or won&amp;rsquo;t they?&amp;rdquo;
These days, the most unlikely TV couple who&amp;rsquo;s keeping them guessing is &amp;ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation &amp;ldquo; &amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle and her boss, Gil Grissom, played by Jorja Fox and William Petersen.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the series&amp;rsquo; parade of autopsies rather than its more subtle relationship dynamics, you missed one of last season&amp;rsquo;s most heartbreaking below-the-radar attempts at pairing off.</description>

&amp;ldquo;They have an expression that&amp;rsquo;s so popular among the producers, writers and cast of CSI that they made it the title of a two part episode that will open the show&amp;rsquo;s next season: Assume nothing.
Mainly it concerns the scientific unravelling of the most minute clues left in the wake of murders, when the CSI team moves in with its hi-tech equipment. But if you want to know about something that appears to be far more simple, say a personal relationship between the CSI team&amp;rsquo;s aloof boss, Gil Grissom and TV&amp;rsquo;s sexiest scientist Sara Sidle you can apply the same rule.</description>

      <description>The scene: the Utah desert, 35 miles from Salt Lake City. Tons of nuclear waste could soon be rumbling toward the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, whose band of Goshutes is already beset by nearby nerve-gas storage and hazardous-waste incinerators. Enter James Cromwell, who played the U.S. president in the nuclear-weapons thriller The Sum of All Fears. In 2002, the actor addressed senators in Utah and traveled to Washington, D.C., to fight a proposed storage facility for 44,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste on Goshute land.</description>

      <description>The producers of hit TV drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation are stepping up security on the show&amp;rsquo;s California set after cast members received a barrage of death threat mail and calls.
Sickos claiming to be fans have been getting too close to stars like Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox - uncovering personal phone numbers and addresses, and demanding to meet them.

      <description>CSI star Jorja Fox is tired of looking like a dowdy stiff. She thinks her lab-tech character Sara should be able to show as much skin as the cadavers in the Las Vegas morgue.

      <description>When teenager Jorjan Fox left Melbourne Beach for good, midway through her senior year in December 1985, she had no idea where she was going. Well, to New York City, for sure, but beyond that, it was a shot in the dark.
The resume was modest. She had taken modeling classes as a kid, done a little drama work in high school, and she&amp;rsquo;d had a couple of brief glimpses of gore as an emergency-room volunteer.</description>

We haven&amp;rsquo;t really had a good Grissom and Sara moment since that day at the ice-skating rink when he told her started caring about beauty since he met her. We&amp;rsquo;re promised another key scene in their relationship on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.) when an explosion hits too close to home.

      <description>TV&amp;rsquo;s No. 1 show finally investigates the team&amp;rsquo;s private lives.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation has always been stingy with details about the private lives of its workaholic characters, and they, in turn, don&amp;rsquo;t know much about one another. But this &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t ask, don&amp;rsquo;t tell&amp;rdquo; policy is about to backfire on forensics chief Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen). His crime lab will blow up in the May 8 episode, triggering revalations &amp;ldquo;that are bigger than the explosion itself,&amp;rdquo; says Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer of the CBS hit.</description>

PLAYBOY : When confronted with something gruesome, who is more likely to get queasy, you or your co-star Marg Helgenberger?
FOX : Me, for sure. Marg is one of the strongest and toughest women I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. Recently, while filming scenes for CSI, she has been in a meat market working with carcasses, walked through garbage at a disgusting landfill in Santa Clarita, California and worked in the pouring rain for days.</description>

Question: Is CSI ever going to get involved with the characters&amp;rsquo; personal lives? I love the show (no show can compare, in my opinion), but many people, including myself, are dying for some romance. Are they holding out on us, or are Catherine and Grissom just never going to open their eyes and see that they want one another? &amp;#8212; Janine
Matt: I think the show is wise to make this sort of thing subtext, not put on the front burner.</description>

      <description>She plays a steel-nerved forensics investigator on CSI, but Jorja Fox still gets squeamish recalling her anatomy class at Melbourne (Fla.) High School. &amp;ldquo;It required dissecting. When the cats arrived, I asked for a pregnant one,&amp;rdquo; says Fox, 34. &amp;ldquo;I thought I was really rugged, but by week&amp;rsquo;s end, I could barely stay in class.&amp;rdquo; Fortunately for Fox, the atmosphere on the CSI set isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly grim. &amp;ldquo;We shot a scene with an actress who was strapped on a gurney and couldn&amp;rsquo;t move,&amp;rdquo; says Fox.</description>

NO one was more surprised than Jorja (pronounced Georgia, like the US state) Fox when the television series C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation took off the way it did. Embraced by both critics and viewers, it was the highest-rated new drama in 2000-2001 in the United States.</description>

Would you enjoy a real-life career in criminology?
I have no desire to do this job! I have a tremendous amount of respect and regard for the people that do. I feel lucky to have gotten to know a couple of people who are criminalists, and have the best idea that I can of what they do. It is very brave and very dark and very intense and very driven.</description>

      <description>Pizza to die for
Jorja Fox sees dead people - but that&amp;rsquo;s her job. As forensic crime scene investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, she determines the cause of death by examining evidence with high-tech toys. Forensic science allows the dead to communicate with the living and producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made it chic to be a science geek.
What viewer see each week, such as the path of a bullet travelling through a human body could put anyone off eating meat.</description>

As a star on the top-rated CBS police drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Jorja (pronounced Georgia) Fox as to watch what she eats. Not or health reasons- although nutrition certainly is important to the devoted vegetarian- but becuase of the show&amp;rsquo;s sometimes gory realism. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned not to eat before certain scenes,&amp;rdquo; she says.
That&amp;rsquo;s hardly surprising give the fact that Fox&amp;rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle- a name that, she says, &amp;ldquo;sounds a little too much like &amp;lsquo;suicidal&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;- works as a member of the CSI autopsy team.</description>

      <description>Gruesome but gripping &amp;#8212; that&amp;rsquo;s CSI, the US crime series that&amp;rsquo;s gained quiet a reputation
If you were asked to name the most successful American TV show, you&amp;rsquo;d probably think of Friends, ER, The Sopranos, or Sex and the City. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s none of those &amp;#8212; it&amp;rsquo;s actually CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which has taken America by storm and is winning plenty of fans here too.
Returning for a third season this week, it&amp;rsquo;s a crime drama with a difference &amp;#8212; with forensic science being the star of the show, rather than the actors.</description>

There are three reasons why Jorja Fox particularly enjoys her job &amp;#8212; and they all involve staring opposite Hollywood hunks. First there was George Clooney, then Rob Lowe and now there&amp;rsquo;s Gary Dourdan. &amp;ldquo;Believe me, there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a bad day when you&amp;rsquo;re going to work with those guys,&amp;rdquo; she laughs.</description>

While &amp;ldquo;C.S.I.&amp;rdquo; is famous for its high-tech gadgets, the music on the show

I aspire to be this person,&amp;rdquo; Fox says. &amp;ldquo;Being a little less squeamish would be a good thing.&amp;rdquo; That won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Some story lines are so &amp;ldquo;psycholigically horrifying,&amp;rdquo; Fox has nightmares if she reads scripts before going to bed. &amp;ldquo;I keep thinking they [bad dreams] are going away!</description>

I know the big thing about &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.) is that we don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the personal life of the characters, but I do love the subtle tension that is building between Grissom and Sara. He&amp;rsquo;s obviously fighting his attraction to her and she&amp;rsquo;s obviously angry about his announcement that she needs to get a life. The really amazing thing is how much more vibrant and interesting the characters on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; are versus the characters on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami.</description>

      <description>As crime-solving wizards on TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated drama, the stars of CSI steep themselves in blood, bullet holes and (very) gross anatomy.
This past summer the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation did what you&amp;rsquo;d expect anyone from a major hit series to do. They kicked back and forgot about the inanimate parade of bruised, gouged, mutilated and (on one memorable occasion) liquefied corpses that form the dramatic center of the CBS show&amp;rsquo;s high-tech forensic sleuthing.</description>

      <description>Someone must have forgotten to tell CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox that it&amp;rsquo;s still summer: The actress (whose show is an Emmy contender for outstanding drama series) opts to pair her spaghetti-strapped dress with calf-high leather boots.</description>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation CBS
Last season ended with the revelation that Grissom (William Petersen) is losing his hearing. But producers say we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect his condition to dominate the season; instead, look for Sara (Jorja Fox) to strike up a romance with the cute guy she met last season who didn&amp;rsquo;t mind her smell.

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s a dressed-down, seriously smart cookie in &amp;#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Invesigation&amp;rsquo;, but off-screen, Jorja Fox loves to get glammed-up for big nights out in Hollywood.
Brains and beauty can mix. That&amp;rsquo;s if vivacious American actress Jorja Fox, 34, is anything to go by. The ex-model plays Sara Sidle, a bookishly sexy forensic scientist in Channel 5&amp;rsquo;s number-one show, CSI: Crime Scene Invesigation, which also has the second biggest TV ratings in the US.</description>

      <description>Love Match
One advantage of tennis: it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing exercise. Just ask actress Jorja Fox.
When Jorja Fox isn&amp;rsquo;t busy playing a forensic scientist on the CBS Drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, she&amp;rsquo;s sleuthing out new ways to stay fit. Her latest fitness foray: adding tennis to her repertoire, which already includes running, boogie boarding and hiking. Fox hadn&amp;rsquo;t played since her teens, so she started by having a coaching session with Sue Whiteside, tennis director at Rancho Valencia in Rancho Santa Fe, California.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; star JORJA FOX tells ET that even though she hasn&amp;rsquo;t received a script for the upcoming season of the CBS drama, she can guarantee it&amp;rsquo;s going to be scary. While Fox was enjoying her summer hiatus from show, she took time to help out a cause dear to her heart: the environment. Fox posed for the Environmental Communications Office&amp;rsquo;s educational campaign about global warming. Long an advocate of the cause, Fox hopes that the effort will help preserve the earth for generations to come.</description>

      <description>One person&amp;rsquo;s death is another person&amp;rsquo;s breath. That&amp;rsquo;s something Jorja Fox knows everything about. The part of a forensic investigator on the television show C.S.I. has introduced her to a large audience. We talked to the American actress about her own life and her love/hate-relationship with death.
That she would ever be standing next to dead bodies that aren&amp;rsquo;t even cold yet, for a living, surprises Jorja more than anyone. The thirty-three year old actress slowly but surely made her way up to Hollywood.</description>

      <description>Within six years, Jorja Fox has graced three top 10 shows - ER, The West Wing, and now CSI. She&amp;rsquo;s the kind of Hollywood Success Story that seems, well, almost suspect.
They call her the lucky charm. First, Jorja Fox was gun-toting intern Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER. Then she was Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano, who protected the president&amp;rsquo;s daughter on The West Wing. When both of those story lines ended, Fox went on to play forensic-science hotshot Sara Sidle on CBS&amp;rsquo;s smash hit CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (Thursdays, 9 P.</description>

After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

Silver Lake, California, 3:19 on a sunny afternoon at the dog park, about a softball pitch away from downtown L.A.: I was scheduled to meet Jorja Fox at 3 P.M. and follow her around with a tape recorder while she walked her dogs. Just when I start to think, This sucks, I see a sprightly, tank-topped, ponytailed woman come bounding through the gates.</description>

Petersen) throw down their ion detectors and electrothermal atomizers and acknowledge the mountain of evidence piling up right before their eyes: They want each other bad.

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen an episode of CSI, perhaps someone pointed out the face of Jorja Fox. Remember in 1996 when Maggie Doyle made her debut in Cook County in ER. It is with this role that she allured the public by accuratly protraying an intern who, after a fashion, tried to make her place among the doctors and befriended Carter (Noah Wyle), before acknowledging her homosexuality. In real life, Jorja is truly passionate, her talents touching everything she does : playing the guitar, singing, writing plays and working with a group with which she co-founded (Honey Pot Productions).</description>

      <description>Fox heads the network war and forces CBS ratings to exploit all grounds. No stranger to television &amp;#8212; this brunette meets more than just the average eye.
Thursday TV is the talk of two networks: one that hopes it&amp;rsquo;s still on the way up, and one that&amp;rsquo;s trying to halt its slide down. For nearly two decades, NBC dominated Thursday nights with its &amp;ldquo;Must See TV&amp;rdquo; lineup &amp;#8212; until last year, when CBS&amp;rsquo; combination of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Survivor&amp;rdquo; put the night in play.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox admits she has trouble seeing herself as the beautiful woman she is today. &amp;ldquo;Up until the age of 17, I was an overweight kid,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;So I still see my body that way sometimes. It stays with you.&amp;rdquo; Lately though, Fox has been feeling more comfortable in her own skin, having landed a coveted role as crime scene investigator Sara Sidle on last season&amp;rsquo;s top-rated freshman drama, CSI.</description>

      <description>CSI&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox is out for truth, justice and a steady job
This week, Jorja Fox returns for a second season of the CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as determined detective Sara Sidle. This is big news- her previous characters have had a habit of disappearing from top-rated shows.
Five years ago, on ER, Fox played Maggie Doyle, the lesbian pediatrician who pissed off nurses and colleagues, then wandered off the series when the writers couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything more for her to do.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox speaks for many of us trying to work while also worrying about current events.
&amp;ldquo;I go from moments where you don&amp;rsquo;t want to come to work, to being very focused and concentrating, knowing there is something I&amp;rsquo;ve got to do, to other moments when I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get it together,&amp;rdquo; said Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on CBS&amp;rsquo; hot sophomore drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s been on three hit TV series in as many years - ER, The West Wing and CSI - so you can&amp;rsquo;t say Jorja Fox doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to pick choice roles. But while the natures of her shows have been diverse, the characters she&amp;rsquo;s played have all had at least one thing in common: they are strong, independent women. On ER, Fox played cranky medical intern Maggie Doyle, on The West Wing she played the recurring role of Secret Service agent Gina Toscano.</description>

      <description>HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - It was difficult to conduct interviews with director Allison Anders and stars Kim Dickens and Gabriel Mann Thursday during Showtime&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Things Behind the Sun&amp;rdquo; premiere after-party at the Paramount Theater.
Tearful guests could not stop coming up to these three, professing love and gratitude; one fan literally bowed to kiss Dickens&amp;rsquo; foot.
This is the intense reaction a film about a 12-year-old&amp;rsquo;s gang rape will provoke in people.</description>

      <description>Actress Jorja Fox has been everywhere on the tube-from a three-season stint on ER to a guest role on The West Wing-but she&amp;rsquo;s found a home on CBS&amp;rsquo; critically acclaimed series C.S.I., playing forensics expert Sara Sidle.
Fox, 33, spoke with Hollywood.com over the phone from her L.A. home to discuss her role on C.S.I., the upcoming Emmys ceremony, the success of ER and the joys of nudity.

Online extra: Q&amp;amp;A with actress Jorja Fox of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;
Jorja Fox, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; forensics investigator Sara Sidle, has a knack for landing in the hot show of the moment. Her face is familiar to viewers of both &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo;, on which she had recurring parts as a doctor and secret service agent respectively. Patty Rhule caught up with her on the final week of filming &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, the CBS hit with a remarkable debut season.</description>

She has a talent for being in the show of the moment: Fox, 32, was in ER early on, The West Wing last year and now CSI, plus the acclaimed indie movie &amp;ldquo;Memento&amp;rdquo;. The New York native is unmarried but &amp;ldquo;involved, and not allowed to talk about it.</description>

      <description>I know you&amp;rsquo;re a huge CSI fan.
I love CSI. Jorja Fox rules!
I&amp;rsquo;m glad to hear that. I enjoy the show, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; show. Because, to me, it&amp;rsquo;s finally the cop show that nerds have been waiting for.
I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s much more complex than that. I think Billy Petersen&amp;rsquo;s character is a great character. We&amp;rsquo;ve never had a character like that before on TV-a guy who is actually really a teacher, and is withdrawn in a way most guys on these shows aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Before she landed the role of scientist Sara Sidle on C.S.I., actress Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s life was literally going to the dogs.
What was your first job?
I worked at a kennel in New York City called the Montrose Pet Hotel. That was when I was 16, so I have no idea if it&amp;rsquo;s still there or not.
What did you have to do?
I would feed the dogs, and I&amp;rsquo;d take them from their little hotels to these indoor dog runs.</description>

      <description>[&amp;hellip;]
Jorja Fox (who can&amp;rsquo;t keep her mouth shut on TV&amp;rsquo;s CSI.) has the dialogue-free part of Shelby&amp;rsquo;s murdered wife. It seems like the wife ought to be the most important role. It seems also that this role was cast haphazardly, but maybe the problem is that Nolan didn&amp;rsquo;t create a more poignant sense of lost marital love.
When it goes Rashamonic and metaphysical at the disappointing end of the story, Memento gropes for a broader significance it doesn&amp;rsquo;t earn.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a line in Memento, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, where Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential), as tormented lead character Leonard Shelby, is asked, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the last thing you remember?&amp;rdquo; He says, &amp;ldquo;My wife.&amp;rdquo; But the sum of what he can piece together from his injury-induced chronic loss of short-term memory is &amp;ldquo;the feel of a person.&amp;rdquo; Jorja Fox, who suffers a Psycho-like death and haunts the film as Shelby&amp;rsquo;s memory of his murdered wife, does exactly that on the screen: creates the feel of a person.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox has appeared in a number of prominent television shows, including E.R., C.S.I. and West Wing. In Memento, she shows up as the victimized wife of Leonard Shelby - only seen in flashback sequences. For her, the experience of filming the film was almost like a dream because she only had to be on-set for a few days. &amp;ldquo;I filmed, I think, three days out of 29. So I had a very short, easy time,&amp;rdquo; she said.</description>

Jorja also protrayed gay internist Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, and a gay woman on the famous &amp;#8216;coming out&amp;rsquo; episode of Ellen.

      <description>First time I remember seeing her was as a doctor or ER. Then she moved to the hottest new show of last year, West Wing, where she played the lady Secret Service agent who was guarding the president&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Then she moved to this year&amp;rsquo;s hottest new show, C.S.I., where she plays a criminologist. She must think this whole Hollywood thing is pretty damn easy.

      <description>Jorja Fox probably prefers not to describe her talents as &amp;ldquo;acting chops.&amp;rdquo; The dedicated vegetarian told The Sun&amp;rsquo;s Claire Bickley she even finds playing one of CSI&amp;rsquo;s forensic investigators a little too realistic.
THE SUN: Does the show&amp;rsquo;s grisly subject matter ever make you sick?
FOX: I think I&amp;rsquo;ve toughened up. My skin is a little bit tougher than when I started. That was my only concern when I started the show.</description>

      <description>The increasing presence of motion picture producers and directors in television is turning prime time into an unwatchable mess of PG-13 and even R-style mini-movies. Prominent names such as Joel Silver (The Matrix, Lethal Weapon) and Kevin Williamson (Scream) have already brought their big-screen values to small-screen series. Now add Jerry Bruckheimer (Coyote Ugly, The Rock) to the list. He serves as executive producer for CBS&amp;rsquo; grim CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the highest-rated new drama of the season and the only new show nominated for a Golden Globe &amp;ldquo;Best Series&amp;rdquo; Award.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox is on some kind of new career trajectory.
The actress moved from E.R., TV&amp;rsquo;s most popular series, to The West Wing, TV&amp;rsquo;s most critically acclaimed. She departed West Wing for C.S.I., the show that has turned out to be this season&amp;rsquo;s highest-rated new drama.
Is it even possible to improve on good fortune like that?
How about CBS moving CSI next week from Friday nights to Thursdays, where it will follow Survivor: The Australian Outback, almost guaranteeing it a spot in TV&amp;rsquo;s Top 10.</description>

      <description>ER fans know Jorja Fox as Dr. Maggie Doyle. West Wingers may remember her as Secret Service agent Gina Toscano, who saved the life of the president (Martin Sheen) last season. Currently, she&amp;rsquo;s co-starring in CBS&amp;rsquo;s surprise hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But even though she&amp;rsquo;s appeared on three of the hottest shows on television, Jorja Fox is not exactly a household name.
&amp;ldquo;I do like to keep a lower profile,&amp;rdquo; says Fox, 31, who plays forensic investigator Sara Sidel on CSI.</description>

Jorja Fox, who plays gung-ho investigator Sara Sidel, said writers are thinking about doing more to develop the characters, but she suspects that will happen slowly, over &amp;ldquo;a long haul.&amp;rdquo; In the meantime, &amp;ldquo;I love being mysterious,&amp;rdquo; she said.
The approach makes for some wonderful scenes. At the end of &amp;ldquo;If These Walls Could Talk,&amp;rdquo; Grissom is leaving the office after finishing the long, gruesome case. On the way out, he grabs an apple from the break room and notices a half-finished crossword puzzle on the table.</description>

      <description>Though its title might suggest a playhouse built of grease-stained pizza boxes and soiled tube socks, in actuality there isn&amp;rsquo;t a stained or soiled thing going on in director Gregory Ruzzin&amp;rsquo;s light, well-intentioned and too-tepid-to-be-trite new feature. A bunch of healthy-looking, Anytown, USA-dwelling white people, whose tiny, tinny lives remain in the general orbit of a divorced mom named Delmar (played by ER&amp;rsquo;s Jorja Fox, who resembles a more robust Julianne Moore), occasionally convene over fabulous home-cooked meals to furrow their brows about nothing in particular.</description>

VALENCIA, Calif. &amp;#8212; Harsh sunlight burst through the ceiling of a burned-out house, turning the CSI criminalists into shadows against the charred walls. Smoke particles hung in the air, but, three months after an arson, the crime scene appeared cold.
&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing left, Gris,&amp;rdquo; Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) said to his boss, Gil Grissom.
&amp;ldquo;More than you think,&amp;rdquo; the cerebral Grissom (William Petersen ) responded, already rooting out clues.</description>

      <description>Through its exploration of anal swabs and poisoned nipples, CSI: Crime Street Investigation - the CBS drama that has been described as Quincy meets Seven - has quickly become one of this season&amp;rsquo;s biggest hits. A large part of the show&amp;rsquo;s success can be chalked up to its stomach-churning shock value, an element that required its plucky cast - including actress Jorja Fox - to develop an extra layer of thick skin.</description>

      <description>Question: I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the actress Jorja Fox on the new show &amp;ldquo;CSI (Crime Scene Investigation).&amp;rdquo; Haven&amp;rsquo;t I seen her on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;? - C.C.L., Dallas
Answer: You have. She played Dr. Maggie Doyle on &amp;ldquo;ER.&amp;rdquo; After her exit in 1999 from &amp;ldquo;ER,&amp;rdquo; she joined The West Wing as secret service agent Gina Toscano. After appearing in &amp;ldquo;West Wing&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; second season premiere in October, she moved on again to the new CBS drama &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; one of the highest rated new shows of the season.</description>

PREMIERES October 6
STARRING: Jorja Fox, Marg Helgenberger, William Petersen, George Eads, Gary Dourdan, Paul Guilfoyle
PREMISE: It&amp;rsquo;s the evidence, stupid. This slick crime drama focuses on &amp;ldquo;crime scene investigation,&amp;rdquo; the specialty of the forensic team in the Las Vegas police department&amp;rsquo;s Criminalistics Bureau. By relentlessly analyzing every detail at the scene of the crime, no matter how seemingly irrelevant or grotesque in nature, these sleuths have science and experience on their side to solve the case.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a Strip-to-strip week for &amp;ldquo;C.S.I.&amp;rdquo;
The new prime-time crime drama about Las Vegas forensic investigators, which debuted last Friday on CBS, visits its small-screen hometown for three days starting Thursday.
And the whole &amp;ldquo;C.S.I&amp;rdquo; starring crew will be along for the ride &amp;#8212; one of them literally.
Series star William L. Petersen, who plays Criminalistics Bureau chief Gil Grissom, will brave the Manhattan Express roller coaster atop New York-New York for one scene.</description>

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s been shot?
It&amp;rsquo;s the question fans of NBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; have been asking all summer following the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale shooting attack on the president and his staff. Tonight viewers will get their answer.
NBC refused to send critics tapes of new episodes out of fear that some unthinking clod would lend the tape to his brother&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s cousin who might post revelations to a Web site, spoiling the surprise for everyone.</description>

      <description>C.S.I. (CBS, 9 p.m.): Weird, wild and witty. And in Vegas! You&amp;rsquo;d have to be strange to scrutinize crime there, so we have police crime scene investigators (as in the title) serving up chocolate-covered grasshoppers, synching &amp;ldquo;Dark Side of the Moon&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&amp;rdquo; and feeling &amp;ldquo;like King Kong on cocaine.&amp;rdquo; Their buzz comes from catching the baddies by &amp;ldquo;concentrating on what cannot lie: the evidence,&amp;rdquo; says sage boss William Petersen (&amp;ldquo;The Beast&amp;rdquo;), whose forensics team includes competitive hotshots Gary Dourdan and George Eads, single mom Marg Helgenberger and gung-ho newbie Jorja Fox.</description>

      <description>After the promise of the no-budget London thriller *Following, *all eyes were on what Nolan would do with a little Hollywood cash. And he certainly hasn&amp;rsquo;t taken the easy road. **Memento **is told with an even more unconventional narrative that keeps your brain in high gear from the very first shot. And it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely brilliant-a terrific little thriller that takes the genre and turns it inside out.
Leonard (Pearce) has a memory disorder: Ever since his wife (Fox) was raped and murdered, he can&amp;rsquo;t create new memories, so he must use a series of Polaroids, notes and tattoos to remind himself where he is, who the people around him are and what he should be doing as he seeks revenge.</description>

      <description>Scoop: In Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s February cover story, director Aaron Sorkin discussed his plans for this year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The West Wing.&amp;rdquo; The most dramatic change is in the cast, since Moira Kelly is leaving.
&amp;ldquo;Moira is a terrific actress,&amp;rdquo; Sorkin said. &amp;ldquo;But we just weren&amp;rsquo;t the right thing for her. She expressed that she felt the same way, and as a result, story lines haven&amp;rsquo;t been invested in that character, because we knew that at the end of the year, we&amp;rsquo;d be shaking hands and parting company.</description>

Jorja Fox, who played Maggie Doyle on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; and the Secret Service agent assigned to the president&amp;rsquo;s daughter on &amp;ldquo;West Wing,&amp;rdquo; said she has watched every episode of &amp;ldquo;Survivor.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I really love Gervase and I love Richard,&amp;rdquo; she said at a CBS &amp;ldquo;Survivor&amp;rdquo;-themed party. Fox was there to promote her new CBS crime drama &amp;ldquo;C.S.I.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I was really hoping some of the cast would be here.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Last season on &amp;ldquo;The West Wing,&amp;rdquo; actress Jorja Fox played a Secret Service agent willing to take a bullet for the president&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Turns out she suffered a different injury while filming the assassination attempt scene in the show&amp;rsquo;s season finale.
&amp;ldquo;We accidentally ran over her leg with a limousine &amp;#8212; and she was great about it,&amp;rdquo; said &amp;ldquo;West Wing&amp;rdquo; writer/creator Aaron Sorkin.
Fox was filming on location in front of the Newseum in Arlington, Va.</description>

Another Sorkin mistake was casting Moira Kelly as a political consultant who began the series as Josh&amp;rsquo;s ex-girlfriend but whose scowly, abrasive role has evaporated into a series of background grimaces. &amp;ldquo;Moira is a terrific actress,&amp;rdquo; says Sorkin diplomatically. &amp;ldquo;[But] we just weren&amp;rsquo;t the right thing for her.

      <description>This is the new favorite show around the Nerdslut Electronic Hearth. Focusing on a group of Forensic Scientists and Technicians in Las Vegas, Nevada, you get to watch two or three different crimes get solved every episode. The science is primary &amp;#8212; and that&amp;rsquo;s what makes it so great. While occasional diversions are inserted into the scripts (e.g., Marge Heckelberger&amp;rsquo;s ex-husband, a gambling problem gone awry,) for the most part it&amp;rsquo;s good solid geek fun, and some mystery to boot.</description>

(PG-13, 93 min.)
Commercially speaking, this ingratiating low-budget romantic comedy seems bound for one of two starkly opposed fates: Death on arrival or modest word-of-mouth success among fans who root for the underdog in all areas of life. (These willful contrarians are easily identified by their tendency to drink Mr. Pibb, use Atari computers, and communicate by CB radio.</description>

      <description>Mama&amp;rsquo;s Boys LLC presents a film directed by Gregory Ruzzin. Written by Fred Dresch and Ron Ratliff. Running time: 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for language). Opening today at Deerbrook, Lincoln Mall, Randhurst and Yorktown.
There are so many things wrong with &amp;ldquo;The Hungry Bachelors Club&amp;rdquo; that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to overlook some of the actors&amp;rsquo; fine work. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that they&amp;rsquo;re stuck portraying one-dimensional characters who make the &amp;ldquo;Melrose Place&amp;rdquo; crew appear deep.</description>

      <description>Offscreen bonds help the ensemble cast of The Hungry Bachelors Club bring a relaxed emotional honesty to their roles.
If you glimpsed the title The Hungry Bachelors Club on, say, a movie theater marquee, this romantic comedy might bring to mind a gaggle of frat boys chasing girls and chugging beer.
&amp;ldquo;I was afraid of that,&amp;rdquo; admitted director Gregory Ruzzin in an interview a week before his film&amp;rsquo;s opening.
But as Ruzzin and Club&amp;rsquo;s ensemble cast can tell you, once you get beneath the misleading title you&amp;rsquo;ll find a hometown story - about family, acceptance and new beginnings.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t let the slightly misogynistic title fool you. This food-themed film, focusing on thirtysomethings at the helm of change, can be compared to Soul Food and Eat Drink Man Woman with a dash of Like Water for Chocolate. Single mother Delmar Youngblood (Jorja Fox) dreams of opening a restaurant called The Hungry Bachelors Club, so named for the weekly bachelor-littered dinner parties she throws. Without enough money, however, Delmar agrees to &amp;ldquo;loan an egg and rent a womb&amp;rdquo; to a couple willing to pay $50,000.</description>

In an effort to draw more viewers &amp;#8212; particularly young, male viewers &amp;#8212; the struggling network has scheduled two hours of WWF wrestling Thursday night. Critics are bound to sneer, but it&amp;rsquo;s an easy move that&amp;rsquo;s likely to boost the network&amp;rsquo;s ratings.

UPN entertainment president Tom Nunan said the Fontana/Levinson show, once titled &amp;ldquo;Flesh and Blood,&amp;rdquo; was filmed only as a presentation.</description>

      <description>Gregory Ruzzin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Hungry Bachelors Club,&amp;rdquo; produced by the team that gave us the award-winning documentary &amp;ldquo;Waco: The Rules Of Engagement,&amp;rdquo; is in many ways a trifle, a low-key romantic comedy about a close-knit group of friendly oddballs who occasionally gather for discussion, companionship and home-cooked meals. Where it rises above the ordinary is in its attempt to address issues of personal consequence &amp;#8212; like infidelity, interracial romance and surrogate motherhood &amp;#8212; even as it maintains its tenuous comic roots.</description>

      <description>Special from The Philadelphia Inquirer
After hospitals (&amp;ldquo;St. Elsewhere&amp;rdquo;), cops (&amp;ldquo;Homicide&amp;rdquo;), and prison (&amp;ldquo;Oz&amp;rdquo;), what&amp;rsquo;s left for madly prolific producer Tom Fontana?
Why, all three, of course.
UPN&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The True Story&amp;rdquo; (working title) stars Jorja Fox (intern Maggie Doyle on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;) as &amp;#8212; get this &amp;#8212; a medical intern whose father is in prison for killing her mother.
And, oh yes, intern Meghan has a brother who&amp;rsquo;s a cop.
&amp;ldquo;In one regard, this is a cavalcade of the work of Tom Fontana,&amp;rdquo; says the producer, who&amp;rsquo;s creating the new show with his longtime partner in crime, Barry Levinson.</description>

      <description>Jorja who? No one really knows who the hell she is, but she&amp;rsquo;s pretty hot, she&amp;rsquo;s on ER, and that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for UPN.
Jorja Fox, who plays intern Maggie Doyle on ER, is apparently doing her best David Caruso impersonation by leaving a hit show to take the lead role on the new UPN sure-fire bomb The True Story.
The show, from the creators of Homicide, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, will be ready for UPN&amp;rsquo;s fall schedule provided the two&amp;rsquo;s escape from Betty Ford goes off without a hitch.</description>

      <description>Jorja Fox, who plays intern Maggie Doyle on ER, is going to keep her job even as she moves to a hospital on the UPN network. She will still be a medical intern on The True Story, a drama series being considered by UPN for its fall lineup. However, Fox will be the star instead of an ER bit player; her character&amp;rsquo;s father is in jail for killing her mother.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; costar Jorja Fox has been cast as a lead on the new Tom Fontana/Barry Levinson series for UPN, according to Daily Variety. In &amp;ldquo;The True Story,&amp;rdquo; Fox is slated to play a medical intern &amp;#8212; basically the same role she currently has on TV&amp;rsquo;s hottest drama.
UPN is funding a pilot and six scripts of &amp;ldquo;True Story,&amp;rdquo; but will decide after the pilot is completed whether or not to commit to 13 episodes.</description>

      <description>You are two hours from collision with an asteroid, and pirates have disabled your spaceship, seeking the forty billion dollars in cash thatÃ¯Â¿Â½s stuffed in your hold. This is Velocity Trap. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty standard mid-range action science fiction fare that benefits a lot from recent improvements in special effects technology.
When watching this film, you must first ask yourself what are you looking for and how are you judging it? If your primary interest in watching films is great acting and a stellar plot, you really ought not to look here first.</description>

      <description>Written for the screen &amp;amp; directed by Maggie Greenwald.
Starring Loretta Gross, Jackson Sims, Cathy Haase, Steve Monroe, Andrew Lee Barrett and Jorjan Fox.
Cinematography by Declan Quinn.
Grim but Worthy &amp;#8212; Low-Life Study
Maggie Greenwald&amp;rsquo;s dark, low-budget adaptation of The Kill-Off is considered one of the finest translations of a Jim Thompson novel from page to screen. Completed in 1989 the movie documents the sleazy lowlife of an East Coast nowheresville and its inhabitants who share a common hatred of monstrous bed-ridden gossip Luane (played by Loretta Gross) who terrorizes the town with her tales and accusations.</description>

      <description>FUN FACTOID
Jorja Fox is also the actress known as Jorjan Fox. They&amp;rsquo;re the same person, but when she joined the cast of ER, Jorjan shortened her name to Jorja. Oh, those showbiz types.
All of America will be watching ER tomorrow night as TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated show is broadcast live for its fourth season premiere! Will Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway rekindle their romance? Will Dr. Greene finally get over his assault from last season?</description>

      <description>*ER* gets a lesbian
Prime-time TV just got it&amp;rsquo;s 24th gay character. ER&amp;rsquo;s Dr. Maggie Doyle, played by Jorja Fox, came out to fellow first-year resident, Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle, on the Feburary 6 episode of the hit NBC drama. To coproducer Dr. Neal Baer, who wrote the script, Maggie&amp;rsquo;s lesbian revelation is no big deal. &amp;ldquo;We also found out that she&amp;rsquo;s a vegetarian in that episode and that she collects guns,&amp;rdquo; Baer told The Buzz.</description>

      <description>On &amp;ldquo;Whose Appy Now?,&amp;rdquo; the February 6 episode of NBC-TV&amp;rsquo;s hit show E.R., the newly arrived Dr. Maggie Doyle (Jorjan Fox) came out to her sometimes nemesis and co-worker Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle). Over this past season, the two characters have slowly made the transition from fighting over turf and authority to becoming friends. Near the end of the episode, Carter asks Maggie if she wants to go out that evening, but she declines, saying she already has plans.</description>

      <description>During an earlier era on television, teens hung out at the malt shop or the burger joint. But today their meeting place is the mall &amp;#8212; and many of them work there.
What better place to set an earnest new miniseries aimed at teen viewers?
&amp;ldquo;Summer Stories: The Mall,&amp;rdquo; a three-part edition of the &amp;ldquo;ABC Afterschool Special,&amp;rdquo; premieres at 4 p.m. today (on Channel 13), with additional segments scheduled for the same time April 2 and 16 .</description>

In subsequent stories, Marla Clayton (Samaria Graham) will have to come to terms with her widowed mother&amp;rsquo;s pending remarriage, and Diane Dravecki (Jorjan Fox) will battle against slipping back into crack addiction.
Beneath the usual television gloss there&amp;rsquo;s a new grittiness, evident even in the casting, which clearly has tried to avoid stereotypically pretty new faces. Some of the actors, especially the intriguingly offbeat Ms. Fox, impressively convey the value of pure talent.</description>

For the next three weeks, Summer Stories: The Mall will dole out tales of teens laboring in a suburban mall. (The Mall was filmed at the Nanuet Mall in Rockland County, N.Y.)
[&amp;hellip;]
There are also Marla (Samaria Graham) and Diane (Jorjan Fox), waitresses in one of the mall&amp;rsquo;s fast-food restaurants. Marla is perpetually cranky because her mom is remarrying without having consulted her, and because she has recently been passed over for a promotion to assistant manager.</description>
