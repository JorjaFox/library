      <description>Synopsis Two cases, both surrounded by secrets and lies. Or at least flies.
Catherine runs with the main case, of a woman, Christina Adalian, found dead in front of her baby, Joey, by her sister. While the scene appears to be a suicide, there&amp;rsquo;s no blood spatter on Christina&amp;rsquo;s hand. Another catch is that she&amp;rsquo;s still a virgin and had the baby via Cesarean. Doc Robbins initially suspects frottage, but Sara digs up news that Christina was affiliated with Project Sunflower.</description>

One case is of Julian Harper, and up and coming actor who was found dead in his hotel room by his best friend, Blinky.</description>
