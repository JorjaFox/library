## Most Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this FAQ up to date?

You're probably trying to ask if the contact information is up to date. Yes, yes it is. That's the official, public, contact information.

### Is this the official Jorja Fox site? Are you Jorja Fox?

No, this is not, nor has it ever claimed to be an official Jorja Fox website. Nor has anyone who works on the site ever been or claimed to be Jorja.

Jorja Fox: Online (JFO) is NOT an official Jorja Fox website. JFO is run by fans for the purpose of sharing information about Jorja Fox's career. Jorja's official site is "'http://jorjafox.org/"' (currently being rebuilt, no ETA).

### Can you get me in touch with Jorja?
No, I cannot get you in touch with Jorja. Use the above info to contact her yourself.

### Does Jorja have a Social Media account?

Yes!

* [Facebook - JorjaFoxworldwide](https://www.facebook.com/JorjaFoxworldwide)
* [Twitter - @jorjafoxofficia](https://twitter.com/jorjafoxofficia)

If she has anything else, she's keeping it private. That means **anyone** you see claiming to be her probably isn't. 

### Is Jorja Fox pregnant?

No Jorja is not pregnant.

If you can't tell, I get asked this a lot, and it's actually my number one pet peeve about running the site. Among many things, it's not your business or mine if she's pregnant, *unless* Jorja wants us to know.

Until she says "Hey, I'm pregnant!" consider this the best question to ask if you want me to never talk to you again.

Seriously.

###Is Jorja Fox gay?###

Jorja's sexuality is her own business. Until Jorja says "I am <whatever>." or "I am dating <whomever>.", discussion about her dating life and sexuality is not permitted on this website.

###Have you met Jorja?###

Yes, I've met her twice.

The first time was in Chicago (where I lived) in 2010. She invited me to [come to the Spotlight Humane Chicago Gala](http://jorjafox.net/2010/jorja-invited-jfo-to-spotlight-humane-chicago/) to meet her.

The second time was in 2014, I'd moved back to California and she invited me to [the set of CSI](http://jorjafox.net/2014/jfo-csi/).

She's as awesome as you'd think.

### Why isn't Jorja in every episode of CSI? ###

Because. 

The fact that she's not in all the episodes is because that's the contract she signed for CSI. If she wanted to be in all the episodes, I suspect she'd have argued for that. That she isn't means she doesn't want to be in them, and that's okay. It lets her do things like Lion Ark!
