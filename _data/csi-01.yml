Just when things couldn't get any worse, Grissom learns that the sheriff has called in the FBI to take over the investigation.

Working on their own time, however, Grissom and his colleagues pore over the forensic evidence in their quest to bring the real killer to justice. The FBI rile Grissom even more when he hears that they plan to use Sara as a decoy."
