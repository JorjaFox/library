Californians for Humane Farms is sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, Farm Sanctuary and other animal protection groups, family farmers, veterinarians, and public health professionals, who have joined together in an effort to launch a statewide initiative for the November 2008 ballot -- one that will improve the lives of millions of farm animals in California. 

Jorja Fox (among other celebrities) endorses the campaign.
