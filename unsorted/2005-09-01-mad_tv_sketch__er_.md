==Transcript==  
(ER-type set. Lots of extras milling about to make things look busy.  
KERRY is standing by a man lying on a gurney.)

KERRY: I&#8217;ll be right with you. I need some help here, people! I  
can&#8217;t take care of these patients by myself.

ABBY: Kerry, I&#8217;m here.

KERRY: OK, I need 10 c&#8211;and you are?

ABBY: Dr. Lockhart? I&#8217;m the new attending physician.

KERRY: Oh. I need 10 cc&#8211;when did that happen?

ABBY: Uh, right after George Clooney left, but before Luka got here.

KERRY: Luka&#8230;?

ABBY: The hot, Bosnian doctor.

KERRY: Oh, right, right, right. I need 10 cc&#8217;s of epi here!

MARK (coming in through bay doors with gurney): Need some help here!  
We got 26 kids outside. Terrorists attacked a preschool with nerve gas.  
Let&#8217;s go!

CLEO: Mark, Dr. Benton needs you in O.R. 6.

MARK: I&#8217;ll get there as&#8211;wait. Who are you?

CLEO: I&#8217;m Dr. Finch.

MARK: We got a new black doctor? When did that happen?

CHEN (walks by holding stomach): Ooh, I&#8217;m going into labor! (leaves)

CLEO: Should I get the doctor a wheelchair?

MARK: She&#8217;s a doctor?

CLEO: Yes, that&#8217;s Dr. Chen.

MARK: When did that happen? Peter, thank God. Finally somebody I know.  
Listen, I got a busload full of kids that are all in critical  
condition&#8211;I need help.

PETER: I&#8217;ll get Dr. Romano.

MARK: Who?

CLEO: Peter, I was just telling Mark you were looking for him.

PETER (to MARK, indicates CLEO): Who dis?

MARK: Who&#8217;s Romano?

KERRY: Has anyone seen Carter? There&#8217;s Valium missing (spots CLEO)  
&#8211;who&#8217;s that?

PETER: New doctor?

MARK: We think&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.

KERRY: When did that happen?

(CARTER comes through door with stack of clipboards)

PETER: Here&#8217;s Carter now.

KERRY: Carter, you and I need to tal&#8211;(confidentially) Do you have any  
idea who these people are?

CARTER: I know who signs my paychecks. No time, Kerry, I got a sword  
swallower in OR 4 with a pigeon lodged in his throat, and I got an  
overweight clown with a bowling ball glued to his ass in OR 6.

CHEN (walks by holding stomach): I&#8217;m going into labor again! Twins!  
(leaves)

(KERRY looks puzzled.)

(LEGASPI comes through bay doors.)

LEGASPI: Kerry, hi. Listen, I know there are 26 children bleeding to death  
outside, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to dinner tonight.

(Kisses her on the cheek, leaves.)

KERRY: Who was that?

MARK: Uh, Dr. Legaspi, your lesbian lover.

KERRY: When did that happen?

MARK: Right after I got brain cancer.

PETER: Wait a minute, when did that happen?

MARK: Right after Sally Field hammed her way through that guest spot.

KERRY, PETER: Ohhh.

PETER: Wait, I thought [[Maggie Doyle|Dr. Doyle]] was a lesbian.

MARK: Oh, no, no, she doesn&#8217;t work here anymore. She&#8217;s on CSI.

KERRY: Oh, good for her!

MARK: That&#8217;s a good show.

PETER: Isn&#8217;t it cable?

KERRY: No, it&#8217;s on after Survivor.

CORDAY: Mark! I&#8217;m pregnant! And it&#8217;s yours! Or Peter&#8217;s. Wait, who&#8217;s got  
the brain tumor?

MARK (indicates scar): Oh, that would be me.

CORDAY: Ah.

LUKA (enters): Peter, I have your test results. (hands them to him) And  
Kerry, Dr. Malucci has yours.

KERRY: Dr. who?

CORDAY (points): Ah, that would be him.

MARK: Do they both work here too?

ABBY: Has anyone seen my test results? (whirls around aimlessly, leaves)

MARK: Isn&#8217;t that the chick from NewsRadio?

KERRY: She&#8217;s hilarious! I&#8217;m confused.

CARTER: Yeah, but we&#8217;re rich.

CORDAY: Mark, Kerry, Peter, Carter. I&#8217;ve got to go give myself an emergency  
kidney transplant. (leaves)

KERRY: Seriously, though, who works here, because I can&#8217;t&#8230;

MARK: I don&#8217;t work here anymore, my contract&#8217;s up, so&#8230;

KERRY: I haven&#8217;t seen the credits since &#8217;98.

ANNOUNCER: It&#8217;s an all new season of ER. Twice the characters means twice  
the action. But we still have all your favorite stars. Except for George  
Clooney, Julianna Margulies, Kellie Martin, William H. Macy, CCH Pounder,  
and soon Anthony Edwards.
