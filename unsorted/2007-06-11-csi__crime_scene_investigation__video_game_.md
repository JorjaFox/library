&#8221;&#8217;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation &#8211; Dark Motives&#8221;&#8217; is a video game based on the television series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]. The character of [[Sara Sidle]] is voiced by [[Jorja Fox]].

In CSI: Crime Scene Investigation you become a CSI agent working alongside Gil Grissom, Catherine Willows and the rest of the CSI Las Vegas team. As a member of the team you question witnesses, examine crime scenes, and analyze evidence utilizing the latest in forensic equipment.

All eight cast members provided their voice and likenesses for the game; their in-game counterparts look and sound just like the characters in the show. Digital artists used pictures of CSI sets to perfectly recreate the labs and offices of the show. The script was written by Max Allan Collins, author of three CSI novels and the bestselling book Road to Perdition. Ubi Soft Entertainment consulted with Las Vegas Senior Crime Scene Analyst Daniel Holstein to validate the accuracy of the CSI forensics referenced in the game.
