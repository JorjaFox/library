&#8221;'Personal History&#8221;'

Sara as a child was subject to violent abuse at the hands of her father until her mother killed her father in 1984.

This dark family history may have given her the drive and ambition to earn an amazing education by graduating as her high school's valedictorian, followed by attending Harvard and the University of California in Berkley. During her time at Berkley, a job at the San Francisco Coroner's office would lead to a meeting with Gil Grissom. Sidle would later be called to Las Vegas to help Grissom and the Las Vegas team and eventually earn herself a place on the Las Vegas Crime Lab roster.

During her time with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, Sara's cases and the victims in those cases would lead Sara to learn much about her life and how she has dealt with her past. In several instances, Sara's abusive family history would reveal itself through anger, even in once case acting outside the professionalism of her job leading to suspension by Catherine Willows and Undersheriff Conrad Ecklie. When Sara reaches a very low point in her life, she opens up to Grissom about her family history and the effect it has had on her as a person.
