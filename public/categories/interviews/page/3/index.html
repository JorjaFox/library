		<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Jane Velez-Mitchell: CSI star Jorja Fox plays a determined crime scene investigator, who won&rsquo;t let anything stand in her pursuit of the truth. When she&rsquo;s off the set, she&rsquo;s just as determined to free animals from captivity. I talked to Jorja about why she thinks Blackfish is a giant step for all animals in captivity.</p>

<p>[Clip of CSI]</p>

<p>Jane Velez-Mitchell: Jorja Fox, you play Sara Sidle on CSI and you do such a great job of investigating. In this movie, Blackfish, the director describes it as an investigation into what lies below the surface. Do you relate to that?</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: Absolutely, and I&rsquo;m so very thrilled that this documentary is out there and it&rsquo;s going to be televised. I think that this is an issue that people are really going to respond to in a powerful, powerful way. And it&rsquo;s a story whose time has come.</p>

<p>Jane Velez-Mitchell: So when Sea World says &ldquo;Hey, we&rsquo;re the leaders in animal husbandry, we&rsquo;re breeding these orcas in captivity.&rdquo; is that a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: It&rsquo;s a bad thing, in my opinion. And it&rsquo;s a pointless thing, in my opinion. It&rsquo;s absolutely pointless. These animals live really long lives, sometimes, if they&rsquo;re lucky, they live shorter lives. A life in captivity, for a wild marine mammal, is a life of suffering and misery and loneliness. It goes against every innate desire that they have.</p>

<p>[Clip of the movie]</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: A good number of these captive orcas and killer whales were rounded up in a certain time in history. We have watched these pods in the wild for many years. We know where most of these orcas and killer whales, we know where their families are, we know where their pods are &#8212;</p>

<p>Jane Velez-Mitchell: So you endorse what Russell Simmons suggested? Change it radically, eliminate the performance of the orcas or shut down?</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: I think the future that we&rsquo;re looking at, if these animals can&rsquo;t be released into the wild, then we can do much better by them. I&rsquo;m talking about sanctuaries, I&rsquo;m talking about ecological preserves, marine preserves, where these animals can live out their lives in somewhat more of a normal way. My first and foremost idea would be lets release as many of these animals as we can into the wild, and lets take the risk and see what happens.</p>

		<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> I have to congratulate you guys on 300 episodes.</p>

<p>[audience cheers]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> [pointing at Eric] He&rsquo;s the only man in the pilot. Right here. All 300.</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> You&rsquo;ve been there since the first season, but I heard, Jorja, that you didn&rsquo;t think the show was gonna take off.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, and I can say that we&rsquo;re [Jorja and Eric] getting old. [laughter] I can&rsquo;t speak for you guys [Elisabeth and Ted] at all. When I see a grey hair on his [Eric&rsquo;s] head, I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m out. That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s over. [group laughter] I though, &ldquo;Okay it&rsquo;s this show about death. It&rsquo;s gonna be on a Friday night. Death in the Western Hemisphere culture, not so much.&rdquo; I thought we were doomed. I thought we were gonna do six shows and we were canceled. I knew <em>I</em> loved it! And I still love it. It&rsquo;s weird&hellip; we&rsquo;re still here.</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p>[audience applause]</p>

<p>[interview with Eric, Elisabeth, and Ted]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Now Jorja. The show is so serious, and you guys have such a great sense of humor, but it must get dark on the set at times because of the content. What do you do between takes to lighten the mood?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, as a matter of fact, we have one of the great funny men of all time on the show now: Mr. Ted Danson. [audience laughter and cheers] And he &#8212; he does some dancing. He was a competitive dancer, yeah, and many times, when it gets a little intense, you dance.</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> You know what it is? My hips are going. I fall. [audience laughter] I sway and fall and it looks like a dance.</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Are you gonna bust a move?</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> Yeah! We were hoping that &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Come on, you&rsquo;ve got to. One or two steps.</p>

<p>[audience cheers this idea on]</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> I&rsquo;ll dance, if Jorja &#8212; cause she does these funny things where she takes her clothes off-</p>

<p>[The Talk ladies break into hysterics, Jorja laughs]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Fair is fair!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Not in these heels, they&rsquo;re not right for a dance.</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> No no! I will, but you&rsquo;ve got to [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> We want to keep it PG here! Maybe later Ted will bust a move. [&hellip;]eros as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we&rsquo;d know each other ten years. He&rsquo;s a master at intimacy. It&rsquo;s not forced, it&rsquo;s authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I swear he&rsquo;s got wings on. Like under his jacket, there&rsquo;s wings. He is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>[group &#8216;awwww&rsquo; and applause]</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s coming out later this year, and you&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&rdquo; Tell us about that.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you for asking about that. It&rsquo;s a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you&rsquo;re from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person <em>can</em> make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it&rsquo;s a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: I was blown away by it, it was so different and I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything ever like it. A show about death, on a Friday night? This is going to be canceled in six weeks, no one&rsquo;s going to watch this! America&rsquo;s not gonna watch this show! And boy was I &hellip; that was extremely wrong about that! [breaks up laughing]</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: It&rsquo;s a great place to go back to. And also, under the umbrella of justice and truth and really trying to get to the heart of a very sad story is really awesomely compelling, I think, for us to get to tell.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: Being on a successful show is the cooling thing that could ever happen to a person. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything. But I think &hellip; I show up because I love being with the people that I get to work with every day.</p>

<h2 id="introduction:d8a5738ef7f3b53ed23480f0c7f01a6f">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Please, before we start anything, give a big hand to Pacific Sun, who is responsible for letting <em>Lion Ark</em> be here today.  The film is co-presented by Animal Defenders International, which had, obviously you&rsquo;ll see, an integral part in the creation of <em>Lion Ark</em>. We&rsquo;re very happy to have this film, it&rsquo;s a powerful film, it&rsquo;s an exciting film. It&rsquo;s going to subvert a lot of your expectations about both seeing a documentary and about some of the assumptions we had growing up or seeing in our culture. I think it&rsquo;s going to be a really successful event today. Please give a warm welcome to an ambassador for Animal Defenders International, and also the associate producer, Jorja Fox.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone, <em>[Light laughter]</em> and welcome to the North American premiere of <em>Lion Ark</em>.  Very exciting day for us. On behalf of the filmmakers, Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, we want to humbly thank the Mill Valley Film Festival for having us at this incredible event. And we also want to thank you very much for coming out to see the movie.</p>

<p>Being a part of <em>Lion Ark</em> has been an epic adventure for me, and today is no exception. I&rsquo;m thrilled to get to watch all of you watch the movie. It&rsquo;s very fitting for <em>Lion Ark</em> that we&rsquo;re premiering here, as it&rsquo;s the first place the first group of lions landed from Bolivia, back in the spring of 2010. Those four lions are living in the PAWS Sanctuary, near [Gulf(?)], California. Moving lions on airplanes is kind of a strange and rare thing. And the city of San Francisco, San Francisco International Airport and the surrounding areas were so very kind to us and welcomed us with a very serene calm and gracious resolve. We&rsquo;re very grateful for that.  <em>Lion Ark</em>&#8216;s biggest stars, the main stars of the movie, lions, of course couldn&rsquo;t be here today. They&rsquo;re tired from their life in show business. But many of the key human players are here. They&rsquo;ve traveled far and wide, from the United Kingdom to South America.</p>

<p>We are having a Q&amp;A immediately after the film, and I very much hope you&rsquo;ll stick around for questions and comments, and to hear from this amazing and diverse group of people who are all experts in their fields. We&rsquo;re also having a party tonight, a bit of a fundraiser for the next chapter of <em>Lion Ark</em>. We cordially invite all of you to come. It&rsquo;s going to be at Bungalow 44 at six o&rsquo;clock. You can see anyone in the black <em>Lion Ark</em> t-shirts with clipboards for tickets, and tickets will also be available at the door if we don&rsquo;t sell out. Tickets are $70. As I mentioned, it&rsquo;s a fundraiser. You&rsquo;ll get drinks and appetizers, and a chance to mingle with the filmmakers and the rescue team. We hope to see all of you there.</p>

<p>Lastly, and I&rsquo;ll be brief, I just want to talk about the film makers. Jane Creamer and Tim Phillips for a minute. Jan and Tim have been working absolutely tirelessly for over thirty years for the betterment of wild and domesticated animals alike, across the globe. They run an organization called Animal Defenders International. This wonderful film that you&rsquo;re about to see highlights just one of their campaigns. Needless to say, they lead very exciting lives. From bustling cities to the most barren and remote landscapes, Jan and Tim have a knack for making friends and allies wherever they go. They&rsquo;re bridge builders, of a sort. Metaphoric bridge building is a very rare skill, a very special skill. I think it&rsquo;s a skill that&rsquo;s sorely lacking in most fields in the landscape today. And I think that it is the Golden Key to finding solutions for our planets&rsquo; issues.</p>

<p>Animal Defenders International works from private support. They depend on private support for the work that they do. If you feel inspired by this film, and I think you will, please offer up your own support, be it a donation, spreading the world, or volunteering, or all of the above. It&rsquo;s ADI&rsquo;s greatest hope &#8212; sorry, forgot to change my page <em>[Jorja laughs at herself]</em> &#8212; It&rsquo;s ADI&rsquo;s greatest hope to give as many animals as possible, out in the world, a happy ending.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, <em>Lion Ark</em>. Thank you.</p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<h2 id="q-a:d8a5738ef7f3b53ed23480f0c7f01a6f">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p>[Asked how they got involved]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I think I was lucky I grew up in a very small town in Florida. My grandmother was very influential in my life. She was a rabid environmentalist, and kind of a modern thinker on a lot of levels, and I took after her quite a bit. I think I also &#8212; it was also the &lsquo;80s, and it was music videos and it was new media and there were a couple kids in my school, eccentric kids in my school, who were vegetarians and would talk about that stuff. It kind of opened a door for me to learn as much as I could. I had a lot to do with books at that time too. I think it&rsquo;s amazing, in the few short years since the &lsquo;80s, how far some of these ideas have come. I really do think we&rsquo;re reaching a tipping point with animals and entertainment and circuses and zoos. There&rsquo;s better options. There&rsquo;s PAWS and the Wild Animal Sanctuary and I think we&rsquo;re starting to get those ideas, and I think we&rsquo;re going to see some really positive changes over the next ten, fifteen, years. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be thinking that&rsquo;s really a thing of the past, it&rsquo;s really not that cool to see an animal in a cage do a trick, like roll a ball or whatever. There&rsquo;s far cool things they can do.</p>

<p>[How do they get all these animals in circuses?]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You (Jan Creamer) kind of just said what I was going to say. Most of it, especially in the United States, all comes from breeding programs. The animals are here. It&rsquo;s actually very difficult now to get them across International borders. People do it, sometimes for the right reasons, and sometimes not. I think there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of animals up at PAWS that started out in somebody&rsquo;s basement. They bought it on a black market, it was a pet for a time, and then it got too big, too strong, and they had to figure out what to do with it.</p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<p><strong>Post Screening</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You know, I love the film so much. And I&rsquo;ve really only seen it finished twice, so today was my second time. I was moved a little more than I wanted to be, &lsquo;cause I was in this public theater with a lot of people. I wanted to be so very cool and calm and collected. It was a thrill and a half. It was amazing. We&rsquo;re so happy to be here at the Mill Valley Festival. We want to thank everybody or having us.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, I think so. Not too many people left early, so that&rsquo;s always a really good sign. I do, I kind of see the film as an action/adventure piece. It is a documentary, and it&rsquo;s real events, but to me there&rsquo;s a lot of hair-raising, edge-of-your-seats moments, and yes, I think the audience very much stayed with us for the film.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Why did I have to make it? I think I was lucky to get to be a part of the film. The events, moving the lions from Bolivia to the United States a couple years ago, I got to be a part of that move, and at the time I remember somebody saying &ldquo;Oh yeah, we&rsquo;re documenting this.&rdquo; and we all had mics on. I was just really thrilled to get to be a part of it. It was, I think, an epic accomplishment to move 28 lions 48,000 miles to a sanctuary. I really wasn&rsquo;t sure that it could be done, that it could be pulled off. Certainly there would be some hitch somewhere along the way. You know, it&rsquo;s funny. For a movie that&rsquo;s so exciting, so much of the work that went into the actual move was so slow, and meticulous and methodical, including securing these laws on traveling circuses throughout the world. It&rsquo;s very tedious work. It was a miracle that it all came together.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s Northern California, I love this part of the country, I come here often. I think that Mill Valley is a very peaceful place, it&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s very connected with the nature surrounding it. There&rsquo;s water everywhere, it&rsquo;s in the foothills and the redwoods. There&rsquo;s amazing surfing and sailing. So particularly, not only for this film, <em>Lion Ark</em>, I think it&rsquo;s a perfect match in terms of content in a place, but also for me as a person who&rsquo;s a surfer and an outdoor person, it&rsquo;s always good to be up here. I love the food here. I love the wine, I love the coffee. It&rsquo;s a really great place to visit, and I&rsquo;m sure a great place to live.</p>

		<p><strong>Monica Gleberman</strong> .. and just ask you, how did you get involved in acting to begin with?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh my goodness. I wanted to act since I was probably four or five years old. I think that the television that sat in the living room of my house was one of the bigger influences in my life. It was definitely a babysitter for me. You know, I grew up in a small town, so there weren&rsquo;t many acting programs. And it was high school before I was able to be in a drama class. I think there were two things that happened. First of all I love it so much, and then second of all, people were really supportive of me, and doing acting. I think I had a lot of support doing it, and so there was no doubt in my mind. I went to New York and got lucky. I got in [something] very quickly because I ignored all these signs that said &ldquo;Do Not Enter.&rdquo; [laughter] I didn&rsquo;t have an agency, you know &#8216;Don&rsquo;t go beyond this point.&rsquo; And I sort of ignored all of those signs that told me not to go further and landed up in an agency, and I was able to have a conversation with my agency and I had an audition, and they started sending me out. It was so processed. But definitely I started my career in New York and was there for probably seven years before ending up in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I have followed your career, and of course I did research before this. You have had some major television show lucky jobs. Some of the biggest shows known to man. So I want to ask you, of course you were on ER, you were on The West Wing. What was it like- I know when you&rsquo;re on it, you might not think &#8216;This is huge&rsquo; and might not realize how big it is. But looking back, reflecting back on your appearances, what does that feel like? To look back and note that you were on these two shows that are probably going down in history as some of the best television?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. <em>ER</em> in particular because I started on <em>ER</em> in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. And less appointment television. I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but people had to actually turn on the TV at the right time. VCR&rsquo;s existed but even then, people wanted to a lot of the bigger shows live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. Even though I hadnât watched ER, it was my momâs favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like in a week or two&rsquo;s time, everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor. That I was just claiming to be an actor and I was terrible. So I came really close to just driving to Mexico the week before I started and forgetting the whole thing. But I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. I always felt it was a pretty incredible learning experience, to get to spend time with that caliber of people every day, writers and actors and BPs(?) and directors.</p>

<p>And absolutely the same goes for <em>West Wing</em>. I think <em>West Wing</em>&hellip; I was a huge fan then, of Sorkin, and <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> had a number of the same producers. I think the thing that surprised me the most for myself was I could get to be a part of telling a wonderful story like that. It was something that I hadn&rsquo;t even dreamed of. I just felt like it was such an honor to get to try and tell that story. I really like looked after Martin Sheen&rsquo;s daughter. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I got to do something like that! I think that Sorkin, he said at the time on <em>West Wing</em>, he&rsquo;s alone, and there had been very few women Secret Service Agents at that time, that had actually been on screen. Even getting to be that, getting to be this female Secret Service Agent was kind of a lot of fun that people hadn&rsquo;t gotten to do.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> And I know, obviously, you&rsquo;ve done a ton of movies and other TV shows, and then you land <em>CSI</em>. Which, again, another- it&rsquo;s like crazy, your career, because it&rsquo;s another huge show! So I want to go back to Season one, and what that was like, finding out you&rsquo;re going to be playing Sara, and where your mind was when you got that call.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Um. That was also a big surprise. I really didnât think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was something that was pretty different and something that I hadnât really read about often. You know, <em>Quincy</em> was sort of the thing that I could think of that sort of reminded me a little of <em>CSI</em>. And I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night, that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do. I was so wrong about that. I really thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. You know, that&rsquo;s what I thought was going to happen! I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later. And it was just this monster. Not &#8212; I guess monster&rsquo;s kind of &#8212; this behemoth that none of us expected. I think that nobody could have imagined how big the ride was going to get.</p>

<p>And thank you for saying that! I&rsquo;m actually starting my eighteenth consecutive season in a row on Prime Time television. It&rsquo;s big for me.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I know! It&rsquo;s crazy!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> So thanks for talking about that stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask- so were you surprised &#8212; before we get into Sara and where she&rsquo;s gone over the course of- and now we&rsquo;re in- there&rsquo;s gonna be a fourteenth season. I want to ask you, I know that in 2007 you had announced that you were leaving the show. Were you surprised at how many fans freaked out and started sending in gifts and money and started a campaign to try to keep you on <em>CSI</em>? Was that shocking to you at how many people cared about this character?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. It was one of the most magnificent experiences. I had no idea there would be that kind of a response. Truthfully, that was my season twelve in a row, and I was tired. I was just thinking &#8216;Oh my god, I just need to lie down for a minute.&rsquo; I just needed to kind of sit down and reground. So I wanted to get off-screen before it started to show on screen, or before my coworkers started to notice. It was an amazing show of support, and I wished I could have changed my mind to show the fans the amount of gratitude I had for them suggesting that I stay. Honestly, if I wasn&rsquo;t so exhausted, I absolutely would have. So yeah, it was an amazing feeling of surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So now that you&rsquo;re back, and you&rsquo;ve been back for a while, everyone&rsquo;s been super excited. I want to know from you how has Sara changed from season one, I know she&rsquo;s had a lot of life changes with the proposal and getting married, but how has she changed from season one to season thirteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It&rsquo;s funny. I think in some ways she really hasnât changed that much [laughs]. There&rsquo;s been some <em>seemingly</em> big changes. When we met Sara in 2000, if anything I think she was very much a product of her past and of her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be a CSI that definitely stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7, and was gone most of season 8, she had a chance to really wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character, who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested, but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of the way I&rsquo;ve been playing the character for the last couple of season. And yet at the same time, now we are in season fourteen, I do feel that Sara- there is this compulsive drive, something very deep rooted. She can&rsquo;t stop being a CSI, it&rsquo;s what fuels her, maybe the duration of her life, she&rsquo;s going to be there in the trenches, on the street, in the muck, in the darkness, trying to get justice for people. I&rsquo;m looking at it again, myself, and like &ldquo;huh!&rdquo; I thought the compulsive side of her was finished, and now maybe it&rsquo;s not, not at all. Maybe she&rsquo;s just the same.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> What can fans look forward to this season? What kind of cases? What are you guys going to get involved with, cause there&rsquo;s always a craziness happening every episode. So what can fans expect this season for the upcoming episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think so far &#8212; we are in the middle of episode 7 and I&rsquo;ve seen the script for eight, and I think we have an amazing season opening up. Really exciting. We have some incredible guest stars including somebody likeâ¦ oh you know what I donât know if I could say cause I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m a spoiler alert. [laughs] We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff â I think the writers this year again, they suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a darker season of <em>CSI</em>, but within that also there&rsquo;s going to be as much character stuff as there was last year. I think they&rsquo;re continuing to write a lot of character stuff, which is great. Certainly we start the season with Morgan in jeopardy, the stakes are really high. We also start the season with a funeral and itâs not really until we get to the end of the show that you, the audience, will come to find out why we&rsquo;re at the funeral and who has passed. Itâs a very compelling kind of suspenseful episode.</p>

<p>You know, yeah it gets crazier every year. I don&rsquo;t know how the writers come up with stuff in season fourteen. The unfortunate thing is there&rsquo;s no shortage of crazy crime in America to draw from. But the stakes continue to get higher, and I hope the fans will continue to enjoy that. I always am partial to the action/adventure show. And so in those episodes where we get a little kooky, hopefully the fans will still be able to roll with us.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I wanted to ask you, was it nice that all current cast members continued on for season fourteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely! Because we have had so many changes. You know, part of me, you were speaking about <em>ER</em>, <em>ER</em> began to lose their core cast members in season three. So the fact that our show made it to season seven with the core cast intact, I think is a testament to the show and a compliment to how much we actually did get along and liked working together and did like the work itself. I think very few shows have gone seven seasons retaining their full original cast.</p>

<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s been really nice to have a cast that&rsquo;s been able to stay together for a couple of seasons. You can&rsquo;t fake chemistry. You&rsquo;ve sort of got to build it organically. The more you know each other, the more you work together, the deeper you can go. It&rsquo;s given a chance for that. I think it&rsquo;s been kind of a really great thing for the writers, because there were a lot of seasons where it was really hard for them to start breaking stories over the summer, because they weren&rsquo;t completely sure who their cast was going to be. Knowing early enough that they were going to have everyone has allowed them to spread their wings more than they could for a bunch of season.</p>

<p>This team, this troupe of actors, you never think that &#8216;Wow, three new actors in practically one season. This is definitely- this can&rsquo;t go well. This is going to be difficult.&rsquo; And to love these three actors as much as I do, as much as we all do, we&rsquo;re having so much fun every day. I hope it shows on screen. As usual, I&rsquo;m just grateful I get to come here and hang out, because it&rsquo;s a really fun place to be.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Of course I have to ask too, season fourteen, will mark the 300th episode, which is like, nuts. So what is that? What have you guys, I think it&rsquo;s like mid-season, right? The 300th?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> The 300th? Episode five. We&rsquo;re pretty soon, like pretty pretty soon. We&rsquo;re going to do ten new shows in a row. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve done that before. And so, yeah, I think five weeks after the premiere tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the 300th episode.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So what is that like? Being a part of &hellip; I feel like a lot of this interview is about you being a part of these crazy, amazing, genius shows. And not only do you have this awesome career, but you&rsquo;re a part of another benchmark, which is the 300th episode. So what is that like, being a part of?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It was such an honor for me. You know, it is a milestone. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it going in, but then we all showed up for work the first day, and a couple people gave speeches, and I started to feel the gravity of it all. I think it&rsquo;s been a great second chance for me. I missed the 200th episode, I wasn&rsquo;t here. I was here for the 100th episode. And to get to be a part of the 300th episode meant a lot to me. More than I even imagined it would. I haven&rsquo;t done 300 episodes yet, I&rsquo;m behind several members of the cast because I did take that season off, and I don&rsquo;t appear in every episode every year. I think with my combined with my <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> I might be on episode 296 or something. I can share that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because <em>ER</em> went 300 episodes, and Marg Helgenberger, George Eads and myself had all had parts on <em>ER</em>, so with another show that the three of us can be happy for and be a part of this tiny piece of <em>ER</em> history. Of course, the history that we have on <em>CSI</em> is a lot deeper and bigger. It&rsquo;s really cool. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever going to happen to me again, to be a part of something like this. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to be possible for a lot of shows to get to do this. Most shows are doing 13 episodes a year instead of 24, which is what we started out with. It takes a long time doing 13 episodes a season to get to 300 episodes. I think this is kind of a marker we may not see that much of in the future. It meant a lot and I&rsquo;m really proud of- for everyone. I&rsquo;m really proud of everyone and just very excited to get to be a part of it. It&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask, and I know it could be a little spoiler, but in the 300th episode, I&rsquo;ve heard rumors there might be some flash backs? Is that&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Ah yes. Flashbacks slash faux-backs. [laughs] That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re calling them. We did out best. It has been thirteen years. [laughs] Thirteen meaningful years. But it was truly fun and embarrassing and silly to try and do it- I hope we pulled it off. I hope the fans enjoy it. There&rsquo;s- You know it&rsquo;s not a huge chunk of the show, but three flashbacks. Four I think! We go back to 2000. There&rsquo;s some funny clothes, and funny hairstyles. I threw in a wig. And it&rsquo;s great. We do, we&rsquo;re- the episode is really about a cold case from 2000, that has certainly haunted Sara for the last thirteen years. And I think it, within the show, Sara feels a certain exuberance at having a second chance at a case she thought had really slipped through her fingers.</p>

<p>So not only did I get a second chance to be a part of something so exciting, but she&rsquo;s getting a second chance to really try and find justice for somebody who&rsquo;s living a nightmare several times.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Is there anything else you want to tell to the fans who are super excited &#8212; they&rsquo;re counting down the hours to the premiere. Is there anything you want to say to them? Anything about the season or just in general that you want them to know?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think yes. I wanna say to all the fans of CSI, thank you so much! Thank you thank you thank you thank you for your support all these years. We are continually surprised and completely elated that we get ratings every years, that we continue to get to be on this show and do these things, that&rsquo;s all because of you. Thank you for your loyalty and your willingness to go on some really crazy rides with us. I hope this year we don&rsquo;t disappoint you and we&rsquo;re really excited to show you what we have coming up.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Okay! Great! Those were all my questions.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Thank you so much, Monica, it was great speaking with you.</p>
