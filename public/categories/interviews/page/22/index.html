		<p>The character Sara is ten gazillion times more courageous than I am. You know, we do things sometimes and me, Jorja, in between takes is like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this, I can&rsquo;t do this. Let&rsquo;s make sure, we need to be careful, where&rsquo;s the medic?&rdquo; And then the camera&rsquo;s start rolling and Sara Sidle kinda just goes in and does it. We did a helicopter scene. This year George Eads and I had a scene where we were rappelling out of a helicopter.</p>

<p>The intent is not to be gratuitous. At the same time, because the show is so visual and we can go places with that, there&rsquo;s moments where we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology! So you want to have that opportunity if you can. Yeah, it shows up very heavily in the scripts. Sometimes the scripts are- I can&rsquo;t read the scripts late at night. I have to read them earlier in the day or I don&rsquo;t sleep very well.</p>

<p>I have so much respect and admiration for the folks who do this. You can show up every day and try and figure out what has happened. There&rsquo;s sort of that quote we have on the show, that we meet people on the worst day of their lives, and take things from there and try to provide, at the very least, some closure.</p>

<p>Sara Sidle is not squeamish. She&rsquo;s very cerebral, and she lives for what she does. And I think she can become emotional affected by what she&rsquo;s experiencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of her ability to be there, to be present.</p>

<h2 id="intro:9cec4b965fd749470bb087dedbfd13c2">Intro</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I never knew that I wasn&rsquo;t equal to everyone else out there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was your favorite female crime fighter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There were the pioneers out there, you know, like Angie Dickinson [&hellip;] I grew up on Charlie&rsquo;s Angels. Those women seemed, they were just incredible. They were so fierce. You know? &lsquo;Cause they were doing karate chops and solving crimes and had the guns and yet they were still young and smart.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** CSI&rsquo;s crime scene investigator is Jorja Fox.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think we feel like we get to play such smart, kinda cool women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want to be when you grew up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I wanted to be an actor or a rock star. A marine biologist or president. [&hellip;] You know, my specialty, here at CSI &hellip; <em>laughter</em> Is right here <em>taps her head</em> I always solve the cases. <em>camera nods</em> Most of the time. Don&rsquo;t tell any of the other actors that, though, they&rsquo;d get upset. <em>camera shakes it&rsquo;s head</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were your role models growing up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Reverend Dr. King, John Lennon. Later Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The world of crime is dark and disturbing, but the women of Primetime Crime roll with the punches.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s an opportunity in a way to sort of go somewhere &hellip; and see a really primal, vital, important part to life, you know? There&rsquo;s three sides to life: there&rsquo;s birth, there&rsquo;s life and there&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you a tomboy or a girly-girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> My mom wanted a little girl so bad and she got a tomboy! <em>laughter</em> And she loves me!</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The women of Prime Time Crime recreate situations that police officers, detectives, forensic scientists and coroners face every day. For these leading ladies, taking on this challenge is an honor.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I have so much respect for the people who do this job, you know and admiration. It&rsquo;s not a job I could do. [&hellip;] Hi, E! I&rsquo;m Jorja Fox! I play Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. I&rsquo;m a forensic scientist, I&rsquo;m also a criminalist. This is Ali, my dog, like Muhammad Ali, the boxer. She&rsquo;s visiting with me here today, she comes with me a lot because I&rsquo;m here a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Narrator</strong> CSI is set in Las Vegas, but the show is actually shot in Santa Clarita, CA.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> This is the set of CSI, these are our offices. I&rsquo;m going to take you on a little tour. This is one of my favorite microscopes, it&rsquo;s a comparative microscope. So you can take, lets say, two different bullets, and put one here and one there and got back and forth and see if they look anything alike. You can put almost anything, anything that we might be wanting to compare goes through this microscope and it&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> If you look over to your right you&rsquo;ll see sort of a collection of all different sorts of weapons and guns. I&rsquo;ve always been a pacifist, I mean it in my very heart, I&rsquo;m a pacifist. But you know, I&rsquo;ve got to admit that when I shot them a couple times, for different things I&rsquo;ve done, that part&rsquo;s kinda fun.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The CSI set is a long way from the small town in Florida where Jorja grew up.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I was really goofy, I was wild. I was very fun most of the time. I had a really great, idyllic, childhood. Like always in water, always swimming. I was pretty fearless.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Fearless enough to want to be an actor.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I always wanted to be an actress. Like always, always, always wanted to be a- I either wanted to be an actress or a rock star. And I couldn&rsquo;t tell you why! And you think sometimes, you&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m living my whole life on a decision that I made when I was five.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Even five year olds can make the right call.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s a great job, because you can be so many different people. I mean yeah, you always want to do the best job you can. I think we all are pretty much &hellip; If you&rsquo;re trying to tell a story that&rsquo;s close to real life, then you want to pay it as much respect as you can. I&rsquo;ve never met anybody in this business who&rsquo;s really not trying to tell a story with soul.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Jorja Fox has been a woman of Primetime before, with recurring roles on ER and The West Wing. But it&rsquo;s CSI that really put her on the map.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Honestly, what struck me was these six lines of this character description which this person had created. Here&rsquo;s this person, Sara Sidle, forensic scientist, criminalist, can drink people under the table kinda thing. Very smart, poor people skills, action oriented, adventure oriented. And I was like, &lsquo;Wow, I really have to go explore this!&rsquo; Sara in a way, it&rsquo;s weird, she&rsquo;s kind of hero of mine. She&rsquo;s much gutsier than I am. She&rsquo;s very spontaneous. And she&rsquo;s a daredevil in that sense. If it&rsquo;s dark and dangerous, and luminous she&rsquo;s in it. Much more so than I am. I&rsquo;m a little bit neurotic.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** But the actress is also motivated by the gadgets she gets to play with and the mysteries she gets to solve.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think that this show&rsquo;s kind of unique, just by the nature of what it&rsquo;s about. There&rsquo;s so much more technology, technologies that are breaking every day. Like we have tools on the show this year that people weren&rsquo;t using last year. So that&rsquo;s an edge that&rsquo;s very exciting. That you&rsquo;re moving with something that&rsquo;s breaking through while you&rsquo;re trying to tell a story. [&hellip;] This is the Layout Room. Whenever we get a case together and we&rsquo;ve got a lot of different things from different places we&rsquo;ll put it all on this table and sit down and we&rsquo;ll hash it out. Like maybe we&rsquo;ve got a shoestring from one thing, and we&rsquo;ve got a hair from something else, and we&rsquo;ve got a parking ticket from someplace. And in this room we&rsquo;ll sit down and fight out and really, often, find out exactly what happened [&hellip;] The story lines are challenging and insane every week and that&rsquo;s really exciting. Like you never know what&rsquo;s going to happen next. I certainly think that TV is smarter right now than it&rsquo;s been in a really long time, and I think that audiences are currently really enjoying it. Like people appreciate it if something&rsquo;s realistic, I think they appreciate something if it&rsquo;s truthful. [&hellip;] This may be my very favorite room. Because &hellip; it&rsquo;s got a couch in it.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** But Jorja doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to lounge around very often.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I love everybody more than I ever thought I could love people that I work with. But I&rsquo;m never home, so I try to bring home with me. Keep my guitar in my trailer. My dog is my guru. My dog is obviously my best friend, that&rsquo;s the oldest statement in the world, but everyone knows it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the one woman you admire most?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Maya Angelo</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The women of Primetime Crime play it smart. They act fearless with their emotions in check. But just because these leading ladies act tough, doesn&rsquo;t mean they always are.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I&rsquo;m the wimp of the cast. I have the weakest stomach, I gross out the quickest. I don&rsquo;t want to see it the most. I&rsquo;m a stickler for safety, I&rsquo;m always worried about if everything&rsquo;s safe. I&rsquo;m the nebbishy one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t doing this job, what would you be doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I&rsquo;d probably be playing a guitar in the background somewhere.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Being a woman of Primetime Crime takes dedication and commitment. The hours are long, the locations are sometimes far from home, and personal time can suffer.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think it&rsquo;s hard on television. Everyone says that and it&rsquo;s a big stereotype, but I think it is. It&rsquo;s hard to juggle your work, your family, your friends and your self.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Crime can be a grind, so each of these actors has found her own recipe for rest and rejuvenation.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I have a little theater company with some friends. We put plays on. I like to go hiking, I surf a little bit.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Success and hard work go together for these women, but sometimes the costs seem outweigh the rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I don&rsquo;t think there really is too many sacrifices or challenges. I go at this mostly with a very deep sense of gratitude. Here I am, lucky enough to get to do what I love to do. You can think to yourself &lsquo;Well this is very cool in storytelling.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s one of the oldest forms of communication. If anything, I have just a tiny bit of guilt, that wow, this is what I do for a living.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** It&rsquo;s the era of strong women.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I feel like I&rsquo;m an empowered woman, and I feel a little naive in that sense, because I feel I&rsquo;ve always been given the chance to be an empowered woman.</p>

<h2 id="credits:9cec4b965fd749470bb087dedbfd13c2">Credits</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <em>playing guitar</em></p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Is that an original [song]?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s an original. Just made it up, not quite sure what I&rsquo;m playing. <em>Jorja plays guitar as we fade to black</em></p>

		<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Thank you. I am here with the cast of CSI. Your show has taken off, like, y&rsquo;know. A train, just steaming right out of the station.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We&rsquo;re dazed. We&rsquo;re dazed and confused and so happy and yeah! It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> I see Marg has gotten a lot of attention for the show for the last, what? For last season.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> But now the whole show is being acknowledged tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Robert David Hall</strong> It&rsquo;s the great chemistry. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to go to work.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now did anyone, did any of you get offers, or did everyone have to sort of go through the whole process?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> They actually made us all audition, I think. Anyone-</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Hall</strong> Except for Billy Petersen.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(everyone laughs)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How many times- How many times did you have to come back?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Twice.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Two times, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Szmanda</strong> Two.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Oh they already hired me like months before, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now, and you shoot on location in Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How much fun is Vegas?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s hard to concentrate sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Vegas is it&rsquo;s own character, you know. Vegas, Vegas- We don&rsquo;t have to do anything, it does itself, so&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Do you still, like, walk to the casinos and go &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna go out tonight,&rsquo; or is it more is it just like &lsquo;eh it&rsquo;s Vegas&rsquo;? Cause I spent a lot of time there, growing up, when my mom was working there, and you kind of get numb to the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There are certain ones of us here who have to have their money held for them.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Ahhh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I won&rsquo;t mention any names &ldquo;(points to Gary, George and herself)&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re here.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> We&rsquo;ll save that for the ending interview, how about that? Cause I have a feeling you guys are all going to be nominated for that. Thank you so much for stopping and best of luck tonight.</p>

		<p>The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn is a TV Talk show/variety show, hosted by Craig Kilborn. Jorja Fox was the second guest, and introduced as a &ldquo;beautiful actress &hellip; helming the hit TV series CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn:</strong> Welcome back, our next guest is a beautiful actress who has helped make CBS series &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; the highest rated new drama on television. Please welcome Jorja Fox. &ldquo;(cheers and applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m doing great.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> you look great, I like the bright colors the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Trying to look alive.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You did &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; everything you touch turns to gold, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Ah, well. No.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Just about.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Can I touch you? I had a really, really great couple of years. &ldquo;(laughter)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Tell them where you filmed &ldquo;C.S.I.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We shoot in the glamorous city of Valencia, California and occasionally we go to Las Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You spend a lot of the time in Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Where do they put you up?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We have a choice. We have condos or a couple of hotels.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> What do you choose?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> The fancy hotels as much as possibly.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Do you gamble?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I might a little bit. The great thing about going to work is you have the excuse you can only do in Vegas because you&rsquo;re working so I have to go to the slot machine. You get a free drink.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They bring the drinks around all the time. There free hoping that you&rsquo;ll gamble all night. You&rsquo;ll catch that little buzz. I think you can say buzz on TV.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Is that why they bring the drinks?</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They don&rsquo;t have a clock so you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s 6:00 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There&rsquo;s oxygen everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There&rsquo;s oxygen and the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t know they brought you free drinks so that they keep you gambling.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> I&rsquo;m just guessing. Why do you think because you&rsquo;re a pretty girl they bring you free drinks?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I love Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Speaking of being a pretty girl, years ago you use to hang out in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, how did you know about that?</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Because they told me years ago you were the modeling type. You use to model in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I was an imposter model in Italy when I was a teenager. Yes, for a short period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How did you find Italy? Did you like it?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I loved Italy. It&rsquo;s an amazing, beautiful, incredible, everything is beautiful in it.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Right, its beautiful. The men are-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> The dogs are beautiful, yeah the man are pretty beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> The men are very aggressive but I heard the food is amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, Can you tell? I&rsquo;m just back from Italy actually. I weigh seven pounds heavier than when I left, which is great, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You&rsquo;re bulked up. Look at that. whoa! Surprised you fit that skirt there.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> You have to wear baggy clothes that&rsquo;s the trick.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> So you went years ago and meet some gentlemen when you were there.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;(stammering)&rdquo; Ah, Ah, Maybe! Yeah, one or two guys, I mean I was there for along time it wasn&rsquo;t like I was there for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> And were they romantic? How were they?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Oh yeah, everything&rsquo;s romance, passion and beauty and-</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> What was it? What would they do? What were some of the things?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well, they would take me to a bar.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Oooh. There, right.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We&rsquo;d have some peanuts and you know it&rsquo;s great, very high class.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You went recently. You just got back from a trip.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I went vacation this year. I was in Italy for two weeks with two days in Croatia and a day in Greece.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Did you meet any interesting people? Did you go by yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, I went with my friend Suzanne [Mara]. The two of us went together.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There you have it, right there, that&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> And we meet no one. No I did, I met an old lady on the train. &ldquo;(laughter)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There, there, there, that&rsquo;s her!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There she is and her dog. &ldquo;(applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How did that go?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We didn&rsquo;t know what to say because my Italian is fairly limited. Just Caio.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You do a lot of this then? A lot of Petting? &ldquo;(hand movements)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, the funny thing is you don&rsquo;t know the language so you start using your hands all the time for everything which is embarrassing. Talk loud and do things like this thinking people will know what your saying. &ldquo;(more hand movements)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Why would she talk to you then. If you couldn&rsquo;t talk? Why would she spend so much time with you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We didn&rsquo;t talk that long actually. I would have talked longer with her but-</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> So when you say you meet her, you just took her picture to show people, so that in case you went on a talk show, to prove that you went to Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Actually I internetted that. I was home late last night and pulled it off.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They also tell me, this is interesting. What did you do this weekend? I didn&rsquo;t get the story, they said just ask her about it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> My friend John and I decided to walk the mountaintops from town, from Hollywood, all the way to the ocean. We heard it could be done.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> This is from the mountaintops up in the Hollywood hills?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, So if you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles you would start at the top of Runyun and then go to the Tree People, there&rsquo;s sort of all these trails that connect but they don&rsquo;t really connect all the way. So that&rsquo;s Hitch #1.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How do you get across the 405?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;(laughing)&rdquo; That was Hitch #2. Then we thought we&rsquo;ll just walk Mulholland, we could do that, then we decided not to do that because we&rsquo;re gonna do this big hike and it would be a way, basically we were going to do a 13 mile hike on Friday and we did 7 miles &ldquo;(looks embarrassed)&rdquo;. It was 97 degrees on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> It was very hot. How many hours was it then?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Uh. 4 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> 4 hours of walking.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> So the 13 miles, we could have done in 8 hours but the Gatorade ran out, the water ran out.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> But it was an adventure and you went for it and it was a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well yeah, I&rsquo;m into wildlife. I like to see wildlife which is one of the reason I&rsquo;m here tonight. &ldquo;(laughter, cheering, applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Finally, finally at the end she got me. I was waiting for that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> And I&rsquo;m bad at it too.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Yeah, I know. Did I give you that line?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, no, backstage they gave it to me, they gave me this card.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Ok, we&rsquo;re out of time surprisingly. Good luck with C.S.I. It&rsquo;s a huge, huge show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you. We had a good year, a really good year and we will be back. More dead people.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Lets hear it for Jorja Fox!</p>
