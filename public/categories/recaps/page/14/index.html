<h2 id="synopsis:e47d5a12905c5991090974b707c20598">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two girls run away from human traffickers, only to have one die at a rave in the middle of the desert when one of their abductors shoots at them. The CSIs notice the previous injury patterns, and begin looking for the other girl, however most of the witnesses were drugged out of their minds. Doc Robbins quickly verifies their fears, the deceased was involved in human trafficking and was likely a sex slave.</p>

<p>The second girl was rescued by Kitty, a med student at the rave, who tried to calm her down enough to turn in, but not before Morgan determined Kitty had more to hide. The trauma inflicted on the girl, who understands English, brings Morgan to tears: her tongue had been removed around six months prior. The girls escaped from their kidnappers after their transport (a cattle hauler) was in an accident with a car. Drivers of haulers were matched with registered owners of the gun used, to match up with Oliver Ruiz.</p>

<p>While the younger girl had no sexual trauma, she still refused to write down any information until after Morgan wrote her own down. Then she drew flowers and refused to explain. The DNA results came back to show they were sisters, which they track down to Jacinta and Rosa Flores, kidnapped a decade ago by their own mother. The father is found and brought to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>When Ruiz is found and brought in, they find another girl, hiding in his hauler. This girl does not have her tongue removed, and explains Ruiz is her cousin and brought her to America. She hadn&rsquo;t even known the other girls were in the truck, and explains that the car that hit the hauler had run them off the road as he was chasing the girls. The Flores sisters had snuck on Ruiz&rsquo;s trailer to escape their circumstances. The driver had stolen Ruiz&rsquo;s gun and run off after the Floreses.</p>

<p>Trace evidence left on Ruiz&rsquo;s shirt points to the father being the shooter. By the time they determine that, he had already removed Jacinta from the hospital. Still, they&rsquo;re able to track them down and arrest the father as he lights his trailer on fire with Jacinta still inside. Morgan rushes in to save her. Jacinta confirms that her mother was dead, and their father faked the kidnapping to abuse them, but Rosa tried to save her sister.</p>

<p>Working a sex crime case while celebrating her anniversary long distance does not a happy Sara make. She disagrees with Doc Robbins as if the dead girl is better off dead. He feels she is, because the girl would never be whole. Sara feels she should have had the chance to try.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The staff and patrons of Frank&rsquo;s Diner are found dead, not long after the stalker of the waitress, Edie, is scared off by the cops. The only survivor is the owner&rsquo;s brother (Vincent), who locked himself in the walk in freezer. <strong>Sara</strong>, Nick and Greg happen upon the scene, coming by for a meal.</p>

<p>The cops who had seen the stalker, Ronald Basderic, admit they did nothing, since he was gone by the time he went outside. Of the dead, only two weren&rsquo;t regulars or employees. Finn finds something odd in the blood trails, in that three bodies were clearly moved and staged after being shot.</p>

<p>Basderic shows up in the morgue, asking for Edie, and Doc Robbins has David call Sara for the paperwork. Sara bursts in with a gun and an armed officer, matching a footprint on the scene of the crime to Basderic&rsquo;s shoe. Basderic claims he had left when the cops looked at him, walked around the block, and when he came back, everyone was dead. He went in to check on Edie, but as she was dead, left.</p>

<p>One of the victims, Alex Brenner, was in WitSec, and had agreed to testify against some &lsquo;very bad people.&rsquo; The US Marshals feel that the men might have killed seven innocents to get to Brenner. Brenner was sitting with a man named Robert Rios, who was not a victim per se, as his stomach contents were nothing that Frank&rsquo;s Diner serves, and he had evidence of having worn both a gun and a ski mask.</p>

<p>The guns are found, stashed in the newspaper machine, with Basderic&rsquo;s prints on the paper. The prints are coincidence, however. The real killer is Vincent, who shot his brother because Owen wouldn&rsquo;t agree to franchise the diner. He had hired Rios to do a fake robbery, killing only Owen, but when Owen pulled the mask off and shot everyone, Vincent had to move the bodies and finish off Edie.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Ronald Basderic was terrorizing Edie Graham, the waitress, for six months. Sara tried to help her get a restraining order.</p>

<p>Sara chases the rabbit trail of Basderic, assuming he had to have stalked someone before. Greg helps her out and finds that Basderic, who claims to hate guns, had shot a man in &lsquo;self defense&rsquo; and was awarded $200k by the judge for it. Sara hates him for it, and for stalking Edie.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still reacts strongly to women in abusive situations.<br /></li>
<li>Sara chases rabbits, spending time hunting down Basderic, even though he&rsquo;s not the killer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> You&rsquo;re done, you son of a bitch.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Basderic</strong> You see. You were wrong. I didn&rsquo;t hurt her. I couldn&rsquo;t. I loved her.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You loved her? Are you kidding me? You terrorized her. You kept her awake at night. You made her afraid to walk down the street. And you want to know what else your twisted love did? It killed her, Ronald. Edie was supposed to be off work at 4:00. She should have been gone when the shooting happened, it she was afraid to walk home because she was afraid that you were out there. It&rsquo;s because of you that she stayed, and now she&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:86a9c239eb02bb4fbc75798470f9f5dc">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In the wake of the season 12 finale, Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter (Katie) has been kidnapped, Ecklie has been shot, Nick quit, and Finn may be in danger.</p>

<p>Ecklie is rushed to the hospital, where the pellets from his injuries match a rifle in the backseat of a car which matches the description of the car fleeing the scene. Curiously, his injury starts to heal the fractured relationship between him and his daughter, Morgan.</p>

<p>Nick, drunk and belligerent, is beat up and arrested, and thrown in the drunk tank, before he returns to work. While he works the case, he doesn&rsquo;t decide if he wants to come back to work or not by the end of the episode.</p>

<p>Outside the Russell house, Sara finds an LVPD flashlight, as well as trace that links the kidnappers to an older building. Not being able to trust the majority of the police now, the CSIs resort to only using personell vetted by Brass. Finn is taken by one of the corrupt cops to a club where they&rsquo;re holding Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter in the back. She attempts to sneak Katie out through the air ducts, while staying behind to fight the kidnapper&rsquo;s henchmen and buy her time. This nearly ends terribly for Finn, and only the timely arrival of LVPD saves her. Katie, meanwhile, is re-captured. The CSIs track down the evidence to a house in the desert, where they find Katie and her kidnappers.</p>

<p>While the case concludes well, Russell is left with a lingering fear that his wife will leave him over his work, and the inherent dangers.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:86a9c239eb02bb4fbc75798470f9f5dc">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>After texting Finn to inform her about Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter, Sara is on hand for when Ecklie is loaded into the ambulance. She and Greg split the load, and Sara heads to the Russell house. While Sara urges Russell to not work the case, he argues he doesn&rsquo;t plan on the case going to court.</p>

<p>Sara also tries to find Nick, leaving him messages, and finally picking him up from the drunk tank because they need his help. She drafts him back to work for the case. Nick helps Sara work through the evidence, including the note left at the scene, which reveals the fingerprint of Lt. Paul Kimball, McKeen&rsquo;s number one guy and the kidnapper.</p>

<p>As the episode ends, Nick, Sara, and Greg are sitting in the break room again, just as they did in the season twelve finale. Greg asks Nick if he&rsquo;s really quitting, which brings an argument between Sara and Nick about when Sara left the lab.</p>

<h2 id="quotes:86a9c239eb02bb4fbc75798470f9f5dc">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t come here to talk, Nick, I came here to drag your ass back to work. So how many drinks have you had exactly?<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Mmm&hellip;. Not enough.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sanders:</strong> Sounds like the LVPD is making a comeback. How about you, Nick?<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> What about me? I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t talked to Russell yet.<br />
<strong>Sanders:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t about Russell.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Words have consequences, you know. I mean, if you say you quit, you need to mean it.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> You quit.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Well, yeah, but I didn&rsquo;t say it out loud. I left a note at reception for Grissom and I walked right on out of here&ndash;<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> And you&rsquo;re still here. So don&rsquo;t preach to me about integrity, okay?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I&rsquo;m not preaching to you about integrity&ndash;<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Kinda are! A little bit, don&rsquo;t you think?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I went <em>away</em> for a little while, and I got my head together&ndash;<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> You&rsquo;ve got a lot of nerve to talk to me about quitting, you really do&ndash;<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I needed a break&ndash;<br />
<strong>Sanders:</strong> Alright alright alright! This is not how family treats each other! Well. Yes it is.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:0647ce39856b810614ad4a055412f046">Synopsis</h2>

<p>DB Russell, his wife, Ecklie, Hodges, Hodges mother, and Morgan all go to the fundraiser for the Sheriff&rsquo;s reelection campaign. While they&rsquo;re there, a triple homicide occurs down the road. One of the victims is the wife of Jack Gilmore, who just so happens to be running the event for the sheriff. The wife was beaten so badly, her internal organs liquified.</p>

<p>Finn and Nick suspect the husband, and when they find bloody a warmup suit and hockey shaft with the logo of Jack&rsquo;s team, they&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s him. They track down the team&rsquo;s equipment manager to a former enforcer for Lou Gedda: the man who got Warrick killed. The enforcer rolls over onto Jack, with a recording that Jack tried to hire him to kill someone. Just as all the evidence points to Jack, Finn realizes he couldn&rsquo;t have done it. The brutal attack on the wife took more upper body strength than Jack has, because he&rsquo;s suffering from ALS. Jack was framed.</p>

<p>Donny Price, a mid level drug distributor, was also killed, and was likely the real target. Price was selling drugs to Jack&rsquo;s wife, who was a police informant. And the bullet used was from former Sheriff Jeffery McKeen&rsquo;s gun. The gun used to kill Warrick. Worse, the lead in the Vice team working the Price case was once McKeen&rsquo;s partner.</p>

<p>The CSIs track down the man who helped McKeen outside of prison and, when he refuses to surrender, is shot and killed. Only after he&rsquo;s dead do they learn the man was McKeen&rsquo;s son. The CSIs have no idea how many corrupt cops are in on the problem, so the sheriff instigates a review to weed out the crooks.</p>

<p>On the way home from a dinner later that night, Ecklie and his daughter Morgan are walking home and having a heart to heart. They&rsquo;re just making amends when Ecklie is shot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Finn and her new boyfriend, from Vice, are out for drinks when he leaves in a huff. His partner comes up to hit on Finn, but she suspects otherwise. She&rsquo;s right, as they&rsquo;re spying on her to keep her under control.</p>

<p>Russell and his family are home, enjoying an evening twitch grandchildren.</p>

<p>Nick decides Catherine was right and that he&rsquo;s out of CSI.</p>

<p>When Ecklie&rsquo;s shot, Sara calls DB, but DB&rsquo;s granddaughter has already been kidnapped.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:fc9489c4ac068e5313b5b05d69f94c38">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A driver for A Pharaoh&rsquo;s Motorist in an off-road race is killed when is car explodes, but his co-driver is missing, and they were all racing under assumed names. Signs imply the men were military. They track down the car to a man, Art Webber, who was helped by the dead man and his friends. For free, they fixed his car and took away some of the broke parts, which they later used on their own car.</p>

<p>Kathy Veck, oil magnate and fellow racer, claims to have been ahead of the Pharaoh&rsquo;s truck, but admits she saw them on fire and figured they&rsquo;d be fine, so kept driving. Russell implies Veck blew the truck up, but does not accuse her. Veck shows him the hate mail she gets, and could care less about more accusations.</p>

<p>When they trace the Pharaoh boys down, they find evidence of domestic terrorists, complete with copies of Army field manuals and the Anarchists Cookbook. They accidentally catch one of the group, Clive Morris, when he&rsquo;s breaking <em>back</em> into the safehouse they found. He turns out to be a bit of a paranoid who hates the government and claims they&rsquo;re spying on him.</p>

<p>All three men were patients at a mental hospital, for paranoia, schizophrenia, and other delusions. They all shared a love of auto-racing, and Malcolm Platt, the missing co-driver, is the leader. The boys considered themselves to be the Three Musketeers (A Pharaoh&rsquo;s Motorist is an anagram for &lsquo;Porthos Athos Aramis&rsquo;). Malcolm also hated Veck, but when he&rsquo;s found stabbed in Veck&rsquo;s trailer, the CSI&rsquo;s realize there&rsquo;s a fourth Musketeer, a d&rsquo;Artagnan, aka Art Webber.</p>

<p>Art blames Kathy Veck for his wife&rsquo;s death and his financial destitution. He plants a bomb in his own team&rsquo;s car, trying to blow her up in the race, but missed. As the CSIs realize Art&rsquo;s still out there, he kidnaps Veck in her own truck, wires it up as a bomb, and drives it to the police station. The CSIs get Clive to talk Art out of killing Veck.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:fc9489c4ac068e5313b5b05d69f94c38">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara and Morgan find evidence in the desert, and then works with Greg on the reconstruction based on the debris field and car damage. When Greg proves Sara&rsquo;s initial hypothesis incorrect and there was a bomb, she teases him but cheerfully tests his theory with him.</p>

<p>When Russell tells Sara about his cousin, who became a paranoid schizophrenic, she mentions she understands, because of her mother.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:fc9489c4ac068e5313b5b05d69f94c38">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still likes taking apart cars.<br /></li>
<li>Sara mentions her mother to Russell, but without details.<br /></li>
<li>Sara still falls for the human condition &ndash; when told a seemingly true, touching, story, she&rsquo;s inclined to believe it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:fc9489c4ac068e5313b5b05d69f94c38">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Morgan Brody</strong> I&rsquo;ve had dates end that way. Argue, pull over, slam the door and sulk home to watch The Notebook<br />
<strong>Sara Sidle</strong> The Notebook, really?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sanders:</strong> Actually, I&rsquo;ve been working the case. And I think we&rsquo;re doing it all wrong.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Cite your source.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Russell:</strong> [My cousin was] a really good kid. But one summer he started telling me about this birdhouse that the neighbor had built across the street. He was convinced there was a camera inside it. [&hellip;] Got worse, too. Towards the end, he thought my glasses were cameras, and that I was recording his every move.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> What happened to him<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> Not a happy ending.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Yeah, I know a little bit about that kid of sad ending myself. My mom.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t know that. I&rsquo;m sorry.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Me too.</p>
