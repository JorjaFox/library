<h2 id="synopsis:a020ddd791ce6cebb3e83d03a8c2fd58">Synopsis</h2>

<p>It starts out in a casino with a guard having his gun stolen and a guest shoots him with it. The shooter takes a hostage and the casino calls in the SWAT team. Jim Brass arrives with SWAT as the negotiator. Once the floor is cleared, they try and open the door. The shooter shoots through the door and we flash back to 15 hours before.</p>

<p>Brass, Grissom, Warrick, David and Doc Robbins are on the scene of a domestic homicide case, where the wife (Janice Cutler) was shot in the face. There is no other signs of a struggle in the room, and Grissom is suspicious. There was signs of sex, but not rape, in the body. The gun was placed inside the mouth. Grissom admits he was only close to marriage when he was seven.</p>

<p>Sara and Warrick inspect the house. Warrick laments he and Tina got married so fast. Warrick finds light porn in the house. The gardener&rsquo;s sock was found in the bedroom, and the young man, Timmy, admits that he&rsquo;d been having an affair with Janice. Timmy says that her husband, Willie, was in a rage, but both were alive when he left.</p>

<p>The prints on the porn match the husband, and Nick calls one of the numbers. Sally, the hooker, says that she&rsquo;d been screwing around with Willie, and he&rsquo;d given her his card. Catherine goes to Willie&rsquo;s office, where a man is found dead on the floor. Another body is dead in the back office, and one man is alive in the back office: Willie Cutler. Willie had no idea his wife was dead.</p>

<p>At the second scene, the bullets trajectory confirm Willie&rsquo;s story. Willy also claims to have not known Janice was sleeping with Timmy. Willie&rsquo;s story has a few holes, however, as he claims to have lost money at the tables, rather than spending it with Sally and so on. The CSI&rsquo;s verify this as the taxi driver who picked up &lsquo;Sammy&rsquo; had the fare recorded, and it was Willie.</p>

<p>Willie, however, has an older brother, named Sammy, who just got out of prison for grand theft auto. Sammy had ditched his taxi ride to the Lucky Dragon, wanting to go to a casino, so Warrick takes the information to the casino. At the casino, Warrick sees his wife, who lies about where she is. They argue, and Warrick tells her to leave, presuming she&rsquo;s cheating on him, when in reality she was planning his birthday party.</p>

<p>Doc Robbins comes to give Sara the autopsy reports, and says that Willie&rsquo;s &lsquo;gunshot&rsquo; wound was actually done by a sharp object that left a blue trail. Like a pen. Willie&rsquo;s shirt is clean of GSR, and it becomes apparent he stabbed himself with a ball-point pen to make it look like he was shot. Grissom finds traces of Janice&rsquo;s blood on Willie&rsquo;s shirt and tells Brass to get Willie. They suspect the brothers were in on it together.</p>

<p>Willie arrives at the casino, takes the guard&rsquo;s gun, shoots him, takes a woman hostage, and takes the elevator upstairs, bringing us back to where we were in the beginning.</p>

<p>Willie takes a very long time to answer the phone when Brass calls, wanting to come in and talk. Brass is unarmed, and Willie lets him in. Willie says that Sammy was trying to help him, and Brass says he&rsquo;ll trade Sammy for hostage. The catch being that the CSI&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t actually have Sammy.</p>

<p>Willie confesses that he&rsquo;d blown the $5000 on a hooker, thinking he&rsquo;d be getting a a $15,000 promotion. But Willie was passed over and then wired himself $50K, all his money. Willie took the money to the Lucky Dragon, so he tried to win big, but it all went south. When Willie got home and confessed to his wife, she insulted him, and Sammy shot her. Willie decided to use his money to get Sammy safe. He went to the office and found his co-workers dead, and realized that his brother did it to protect him.</p>

<p>The kicker is that Sammy died a month ago. Brass calls out the safe word, Willie shoots him, and the SWAT team kills Willie.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A well-to-do man is found dead, far from his hotel, in fancy, party clothes. He was on a scripted night of fantasy and entertainment, which included hustling people at pool, being chased in a high speed car race, and getting the beautiful girl. What was not a part of the script is his death.</p>

<p>The team follows the victim via hotel surveillance, discovering who he was with and where he went; a banged-up Ferarri gives them more clues. As part of his vacation, his boss set him up with a &lsquo;fantasy fulfillment&rsquo; service, one which checks a client&rsquo;s background to reveal their secret desires, then crafts a fantasy based on those desires. Normally the service is used by marketers and advertisers, to create a climate in which people will be more relaxed and more inclined to buy their products or services.</p>

<p>In the end, the high-roller dies because he can&rsquo;t tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and gets a fatal beating from the bodyguards of a rich Korean gambler.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara is her usual investigative self in this, trading barbs with Greg as they strip a car, and tracing cell phones via computer. There are, however, unspoken vibes in the air. At the end, when the team is putting together the final clues of the puzzle, the talk turns to fantasies &ndash; several times during this she and Grissom exchange glances, leaving us to wonder what their fantasies might be like.</p>

<p>Spoilers made much of the scene between Grissom, Sara and Caprice (the man running the fantasy fulfillment service), and how his insight would reveal an aspect of Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s &lsquo;relationship.&rsquo; In truth, the scene was tame and while both Grissom and Sara stole looks at each other, nothing overt was brought up. It was obvious Sara still has feelings for Grissom, and it appears Grissom may still harbor affection, but nothing is definitive.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As has been noted before, Sara seems most comfortable working with Greg, trading quips and jokes with him.<br /></li>
<li>Sara obviously has her fantasies, but we will probably never know what they are &ndash; other than the fact that they likely involve Grissom.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Quotes</h2>

<p>Sara Please tell me there are something more to this guys and cars thing, besides the obvious penis extension metaphors.<br />
<strong>Greg:</strong> So you want me to lie?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Grissom:</strong> Some guys are intimidated by beauty. Or fear rejection. _<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> _(narrows her eyes in reaction to this__</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Solving the case of wealthy defense attorney Diane Chase &ndash; killed at her son&rsquo;s wedding &ndash; is compromised when all of the evidence from the case is stolen along with Nick&rsquo;s car, while he, Greg and Sara are having breakfast at their traditional restaurant (the same as seen in &ldquo;The Strip Strangler&rdquo; back in season one).</p>

<p>Confined to the lab until Internal Affairs arrives, and without the evidence, the three reconstruct the case from their memories and the videographer&rsquo;s DVD of the event. They initially assume that whomever stole the car also killed Diane, however it was really the bridesmaids, acting in cahoots, who accidently killed Diane and covered it up. By the time Internal Affairs arrives to take their statements, the case has been solved, and the criminals confessed.</p>

<p>Much of the episode is told via flashbacks, and everyone&rsquo;s version of the event has a different feel. Sara&rsquo;s seems to be anti-wedding, while Nick embraces the sappier side of marriage. Grissom and Brass are very cut and dried, but Greg is a nearly over-the-top film noir. The name of the episode is a play on the movie, Rashomon, which revolves around the issue that, due to differeing witness accounts, it can be impossible to discern the truth.</p>

<p>At the end of the episode, Grissom states that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one of them Internal Affairs speaks with first, as their stories will all be the same.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>There is a duality to Sara in this episode &ndash; she goes from pessimistic and negative (voicing her opposition to tradition, her commentary on marriage) to humorous and cheerful (the guy flirting with her, comments to Nick). She doesn&rsquo;t like people who blindly follow traditions &ndash; demonstrating some &lsquo;Grissom-esque&rsquo; recall on the subject of marriage &ndash; but she also says that she&rsquo;s not anti-wedding. While waiting for IAB, she takes a nap in the locker room (face down on the bench), and is enthusiastic when Catherine wakes her to process the car. Despite the situation &ndash; stolen evidence and an IAB investigation &ndash; she doesn&rsquo;t let herself get frustrated.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara (and Greg) maxed out on overtime.<br /></li>
<li>Sara is not anti-wedding, but anti-stupid. She dislikes people following traditions merely for the sake of tradition.<br /></li>
<li>Sara actually knows about the history of weddings, including the fact that bridesmaids dressed like the bride to confuse evil spirits.<br /></li>
<li>As has been noted before, Sara doesn&rsquo;t mind when guys flirt with her, even if it is a drunken guy at the reception; she takes it all in stride and may appreciate the attention.<br /></li>
<li>Sara is familiar with author Raymond Chandler&rsquo;s work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(holding up lingerie against herself for size)</em> Just in time. I need your hands.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I need you to reprint the bumper, since the tape lifts were stolen.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Oh.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Ah tradition, like becoming property exchanged between your father and your husband.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(voiceover)</em> Can the love be real when the flowers aren&rsquo;t?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Should I write down flirting?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I was printing. <em>He</em> was flirting.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(waking up from nap in locker room)</em> Finally. Something to process.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I&rsquo;m not anti-wedding, I&rsquo;m just anti-stupid.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:de9f7aca2bf0b94571d05fca9fe6abba">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Three members of a rap artist Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team are found dead after attempting to hang posters of rival rapper, Dollar, in a bikini and a &lsquo;Dude&rsquo;s Gone Wild&rsquo; pose. The poster was made off a video taken while Dollar was held at gunpoint, which was orchestrated by one of Dollar&rsquo;s own street team; Dante. Dante had only joined up to get close to Dollar. His sister, Trish, had been in a &lsquo;Girls Gone Nuts&rsquo; video, made by Dollar, and when their father saw it, beat Trish nearly to death.</p>

<p>The video was then sent to Hi-Def&rsquo;s right-hand woman, J-Lady, who possibly let it spread all over the internet. Three kids from Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team went to poster unflattering pictures from the tape over Vegas, and the posters were seen by a member of Dollar&rsquo;s street team. Another member, Morris, worshiped Dollar, and took the gun his older brother had stolen, and gunned down Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team, killing all three members.</p>

<p>The driver of the car confessed to running over one of the kids, and fingered the shooter, Morris. Dante was also in the car at the time of the murders, and confessed to having set Dollar up.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:23c9d584604770b385c8d701c82851f5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Grissom and his team investigate the case of psychic Sedona Wiley who envisioned her own death. During a &lsquo;reading&rsquo; with two young women (Anah Leah and Lori from Evaluation Day), the psychic begins to see visions of her own murder instead of information pertaining to her clients. When she is later found dead in her occult shop, it is up to the CSI team to determine her true cause of death. Greg, who reveals to Grissom that an expertise in the &lsquo;occult&rsquo; runs in his family, suspects greater forces may be responsible for the woman&rsquo;s demise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a retired cop who used the psychic for help on a 15 year old case of Claire Wallace, believes the suspect in his cold case is the killer. Brass and Grissom agree to reopen the case, and discover the psychic used extortion with other people. Following the psychic&rsquo;s advice, they uncover the body of the long dead wife from the cold case, and subsequently determine that Claire&rsquo;s husband, Gordon, did in deed kill Sedona, believing that she had psychically uncovered that he had killed his wife.</p>

<p>Grissom, who has steadfastly maintained that science will always crack the case in the end, shows Greg Sedona&rsquo;s &lsquo;death&rsquo; book, in which she has written generic phrases to use when speaking of the dead. One of those phrases clued the retired cop into where he should be looking, but only by the power of suggestion..</p>
