<h2 id="synopsis:a1bf0e53c89e08026ea8364846a69be8">Synopsis</h2>

<p>At her birthday party, Lois O&rsquo;Neill, a former Vegas show girl and ex of one of Vegas&rsquo; founders, is having a bash. Dancing with handsome men and dolling out advice to the younger set. So it&rsquo;s surprising when one of her waiters, Tim Duke, is found dead by her assistant later that night and Lois is nowhere to be seen. When the assistant, Eve Girard, is asked to open the closet/safe, Lois is found cowering within, and evidence points to her being shot at as she went to hide.</p>

<p>Lois admits she often comes up to change during parties (one dress for greeting, one for diner and dancing, and one for desert). She&rsquo;d offered Tim the job because he needed the money. When she came up to change, someone shot him and tried to shoot her, so she locked herself in the closet. Lois claims she&rsquo;s a suspect because of the tell-all book she wrote. Greg is smitten and asks for her autograph. Lois&rsquo; driver, Bob Jensen, used to drive for her boyfriend, Tony C. (who vanished ala Jimmy Hoffa), refuses to talk about anything.</p>

<p>Sara and David Phillips check out the body. Two shots and a lot of money in his pocket, as well as an empty crack vial. Sara goes to tell Catherine, who explains that her mother was a back-up dancer for Lois. Nick collects the security cameras and information about all the people at the party, which includes the Sheriff and Sam Braun, Catherine&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>In attendance also is pop star Li&rsquo;l Cherry, who left the room when the killing happened. The Sheriff orders Grissom to let everyone who <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> leave the room to be let go. Cherry makes a scene and tries to run off before grissom can search her bag. Of course they do and find a crack pipe. At the interrogation, the point out that the victim had a crack pipe, and so did Cherry. Cherry denies involvement with the shooting.</p>

<p>Sara and Greg find millions in cash under the floor. Lois says she didn&rsquo;t know it was there, but Eve says she knew about it. The coroner determines that Tim was shot and killed by a bullet through the heart, dying instantly, and then shot again ten minutes later in the head, contrary to what Lois said.</p>

<p>Sara, Greg and Warrick discuss possibilities for the murder of ex boxer and petty thief, Tim Duke. Greg speculates the money is stolen from a &lsquo;famous&rsquo; Pan-Am heist in 1965, and that Tony C. left the money for Lois. One possibility for the murder is that he was a hit man, hired to kill Lois. Another is that Tony hired Tim to protect Lois because of the book. A third is that Lois herself was the killer. Catherine and Sara go to check her dinner dress for GSR but the dress is missing. Sara finds the ring instead and it is, indeed, positive for GSR, and the gun used to kill Tim matches the one from the Pan-Am flight.</p>

<p>When Brass and Grissom go to check on Lois about the mater, they find her dead, shot in her own bed. Lois was already dying of tumors, and Bob confesses the rest. Lois had tried to cover up Tim&rsquo;s death. She&rsquo;d hired him to plan this last bash and then kill her, so she could die pretty at the party, instead of a dried up old bag in the hospital. But Tim had tried to steal from her, and she shot him with Tony&rsquo;s gun, the same gun he&rsquo;d used to steal from Pan-Am years ago. With Tim dead, Lois asked Bob to kill her so she could die with a little dignity.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two Daddy&rsquo;s girls pay high prices when their worlds invite murder and mayhem.</p>

<p>Bianca Desmond, daughter of &lsquo;Gas &amp; Sip&rsquo; king, Happy Harry Desmond, lives with her boyfriend Ahren, who is found dead in her garage after a night of partying with Bianca and Chelsea Wannamaker. Bianca demonstrates a bit of a cleaning jag, prompting the CSIs to suspect she&rsquo;s a speed freak. Chelsea claims they only use drugs recreationally. A drop of blood was found in the bedroom, but it doesn&rsquo;t match Ahren or Bianca, and a bullet is found in a soda can in the garage.</p>

<p>The blood <em>does</em> match Justin Cole, a meth-using ex of Bianca&rsquo;s. He finds it funny that Ahren was shot at, because he too was shot in the knee and chased away from Bianca. The soda-can bullet happens to match one found in the knee of Bianca&rsquo;s meth-head ex-boyfriend. Since it looks like Ahren fought back, the CSIs determine he managed to avoid the gun, only to be stabbed in the femoral artery, bleeding out in minutes. The bullet, however, is copper, and doesn&rsquo;t help with matching it to anything on a database. The garage is well organized, and Warrick finds one screwdriver that doesn&rsquo;t match anything. The screwdriver belongs to Tom Harper, who installed DSL and provides the work order.</p>

<p>The main shocker is that Chelsea is Bianca&rsquo;s mother and Happy Harry her father. Chelsea had slept with Ahren and Bianca had found out, but the couple had made up and decided to move to Colorado. Harry, on the other hand, is surprised to find that Chelsea was cheating on him, with Ahren. All of Harry&rsquo;s guns are checked and none match. Chelsea has a gun, but claims it had been stolen earlier that month.</p>

<p>When the CSIs go to talk to Bianca about guns, they find her bloddied and beaten in her home. At the ER, after Sara chases out Bianca&rsquo;s parents, Bianca says Sara shouldn&rsquo;t have taken away her father&rsquo;s innocence, regarding her mother&rsquo;s infidelity. Sara says that whomever beat up Bianca is the killer, and Bianca should stop trying to protect her family. But Bianca won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The CSIs review the evidence. The substance found on Bianca&rsquo;s neck (in the ER) is found on railroad ties and telephones poles. Tom Harper&rsquo;s DSL work order was for a Sunday. Sara tests the paper and determines the order has been counterfeited. This leads her to examine phone records and find that Bianca had some serious overlap with her three boyfriends: Tom, Justin, and Ahren.</p>

<p>In an interview, Tom admits that he had been tapping Bianca&rsquo;s phone line, to keep an eye on her and protect her. He also says that Chelsea had asked him to scare off Justin. Tom tried to scare off Ahren when he overheard Bianca telling her father she wanted to moved to Colorado with Ahren. Only the shot went wide, and when Tom kicked at Ahren&rsquo;s groin, his pole-climbing spike punctured Ahren&rsquo;s aterey. Both he and Chelsea are charged with murder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Catherine and Nick work a case that harkens back to Walter Gordon (from &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo;), the man who buried Nick alive. Accountant Sylvia Mullins is killed by her own car, pinned against the wall. The security guard had been asleep, and the camera had been turned out of focus an hour before. This sets the crime as a homicide, and no simple hit-and-run. While going through Sylvia&rsquo;s belongings, Nick finds that she was working with Kelly Gordon, Walter&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Nick interviews Kelly, and determines that Sylvia was the trustee to Walter&rsquo;s estate. He accuses her of murder, and she claims innocence. As Nick reviews the case, he finds the new evidence Grissom logged in &ldquo;Bodies in Motion&rdquo;. Nick confronts Archie on the evidence, and though angry, asks Archie to see if Kelly is the second voice on the tape. It turns out the voice is Sylvia&rsquo;s. Also, the hand that unfocused the security camera was Kelly&rsquo;s and Sylvia was possibly embezzling from her clients.</p>

<p>Kelly Gordon is arrested and confesses. She killed Sylvia because the ransom plot was Sylvia&rsquo;s idea. Sylvia had also taken the money from the Gordon estate. As the episode ends, Kelly is ODing on handfuls of meds, and her death is uncertain though likely.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>After talking to Bianca in the ER, Sara notices the substance on her skin and snaps up the nurse&rsquo;s gloves. It&rsquo;s this evidence that leads them to look at Tom closer and eventually find the killer. While Sara is more subdued than normal with an abuse case, she still shows her strong distaste in those situations.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still reacts strongly to rape and abuse cases, where women are victimized.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(looking at Grissom)</em> I guess some people just shouldn&rsquo;t be together.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:bd041d9138d3294e3a7e41202040e1e2">Synopsis</h2>

<p>An anonymous phone call informs 911 that a man is dead in his house. When the CSIs arrive, they find a dead Hayden Bradford, who puts new meaning to the term hirsute. Hayden had Hypertrichosis, and was killed via a silver bullet through the heart.</p>

<p>Warrick and Sara explore the inside of the house and find that a woman named Michelle (who had called Hayden 6 times that night) was in pictures and appeared to be his girlfriend. Also, casinodan@gmail.com had sent threatening emails to Dan about a debt. Outside, Catherine and Nick find a broken window, a rock with a print, and a buried gun.</p>

<p>At the lab, Archie traces down Casino Dan, and when Warrick and Greg interview him, he claims that Hayden had lost $10,000 on Dan&rsquo;s poker site. Hayden claimed credit card fraud when he started loosing and stuck Dan with the bill. After Dan leaves, Warrick notices the trace from his shoes seems to resemble that from the crime scene.</p>

<p>The print from the rock belongs to a man named Brent, who claims to be Hayden&rsquo;s best friend and Michelle&rsquo;s brother. When Michelle is eventually tracked down, she was brokenhearted.</p>

<p>Sofia and Sara check out the phone booth where the 911 call was made from, though Sofia arrives first and prints the booth without Sara. Sofia also points out the large quantity of hair that seems to have been &lsquo;shedded&rsquo; on the ground. Sara takes this to the lab, where the hair is determined to be that of Hayden&rsquo;s twin sister, Allison. That said, there is no paper trail at all for Alison.</p>

<p>Back at the house, Catherine finds a secret room in the house where the sister lives. Allison has been hiding in her room for years, never coming out and never talking to people. Her father ran off years ago and the mother was dead. When Hayden was shot, she&rsquo;d been hiding in her room, and only came out at midnight to call the police, in the hopes they wouldn&rsquo;t find her.</p>

<p>Grissom feels bad for Allison, sympathizing with her desire not to be seen as a freak. Nick agrees, and says that Hayden was looking for their mom, who wasn&rsquo;t dead but left them when the twins were teenagers. The mother comes to the station and tells Grissom that she realized she had to leave so that Allison wouldn&rsquo;t always depend on her, and so she faked her death. Now it was too late to go back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Casino Dan&rsquo;s trace connects him to the crime scene. He admits he came by to hassle Hayden about the money, but only looked in the window. When Dan saw Hayden (and Hayden saw Dan), he freaked out and ran off because Hayden was a freak.</p>

<p>The autopsy (which takes a long time, becuase all of Hayden&rsquo;s hair had to be shaved off first) suggests Hayden was killed in Allison&rsquo;s room. A check of her room finds blood stains under the bed. Allison confesses that Hayden had actually been shot in her room: he&rsquo;d come in, asked for her gun (which she&rsquo;d buried outside) and then been shot. Allison saw the face of Hayden&rsquo;s killer reflected in her TV: Brent.</p>

<p>Brent confesses to the murder, saying that his family blamed him for Hayden and Michelle being engaged, and he did it all to protect Michelle. Michelle admits she suspected Brent had killed Hayden, but he&rsquo;d threatened her to keep her quiet.</p>

<p>In the end, Allison has enough money to take care of herself, but tells Catherine her greatest secret. Allison knew her mother was never dead.</p>

<p>The episode ends with Mrs. Bradford knocking on the door to Allison&rsquo;s house.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:bd041d9138d3294e3a7e41202040e1e2">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara&rsquo;s most interesting scene is when she meets Sofia by the phone booth. Sofia is irritable and pushy and angry, while Sara is mild and calm. The disparity between the characters shows a depth of calm that Sara didn&rsquo;t always have. Sara doesn&rsquo;t comment about Sofia tampering with evidence at the scene (processing when she shouldn&rsquo;t have been).</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:72c8e5d1b542b06cc5ab6309513187fa">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Karen Matthews, a widow to a soldier who died in Afghanistan, reports her son, 6 year-old Jesse, has gone missing from a playground. Other parents at the park report they saw a boy looking like Jesse being watched by a white male with a 51&rsquo;s baseball cap, as does a necropheliac who saw the boy in the restroom.</p>

<p>When Jesse is found in the company of the man and his wife, his DNA matches theirs and he refers to them as his parents. Jesse is actually Adam Esposito. Karen had taken photos from the Esposito family website and photoshopped Adam into pictures with her, essentially stalking the family. However, DNA taken from Karen&rsquo;s house shows that there is a Jesse, and he is missing. Karen herself is more than a little crazy, claiming that Catherine saw Jesse at Karen&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>The CSIs determine no one has actually seen Jesse in four years, not since the funeral of Karen&rsquo;s husband, Dwight. Now working a 4 year-old cold case, the CSIs assume the worst: that Jesse is dead. Investigating Karen&rsquo;s house, they find heavy duty anti-psychotics with a four year-old prescription. Opposing Karen&rsquo;s claim that Jesse was home schooled, Grissom determines it was Karen who did the finger-painting and other messes caused by &lsquo;Jesse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The CSIs find traces of a body, but not the body itself, in the backyard, and conclude that Karen must have moved the body. Based on testimony from her neighbor, they suspect that the neighbor&rsquo;s dog smelled the body and tried to dig it up, for which Karen killed it (or so claimed the dog&rsquo;s owner). Then she moved Jesse&rsquo;s body to protect it. On the basis of the drugs found in the soil where Jesse <em>had</em> been buried, they infer that Karen gave Jesse her drugs after the funeral, killing him.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, Karen is undeniably insane. While she is guilty of filicide, it is unlikely Karen will face trial. As the episode ends, Karen imagines she sees her son, running to her.</p>

<p>Grissom and Catherine confront a case of a man with [<a href="http://www.pwsausa.org/">http://www.pwsausa.org/</a> Prader-Willi Syndrome] who literally ate himself to death. Jerry Gable required constant supervision all his life, or he would eat non-stop. He lived with his sister, but when she went to the hospital for surgery, she left her boyfriend to watch Jerry. Jerry manipulated the boyfriend to take him to a buffet, where he chowed down at the buffet itself and was kicked out. The boyfriend hatched a plan to enter Jerry in an extreme eating contest, which Jerry came in third. But Jerry was still hungry and ran off, eventually eating himself to death.</p>

<p>Nick and Sara watch a divorce end with the death of both parties. Michael and Lori Tinsley fought over everything, from the house and the vinyl collection, to their dog Kahlua. Finally they agree to let the dog decide, and in the presence of a lawyer, both call the dog to them. Kahula chose Lori, however she cheated by rubbing bacon on her hands. Michael came back that night to swap out the real Kahula with a look-alike he&rsquo;d bought at the shelter. Lori was home and confronted him, shooting him bizzarely up the nostril with her .22 caliber. The faux-Kahula was likely abused, and the loud noise set her off, causing her to rip out Lori&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>Sara and Nick are both sharp cookies on this case. While Nick follows the blood drops, Sara investigates the missing vinyl selection. Both determine that the missing albums, between the Beach Boys and Billy Joel can only be [<a href="http://www.beatles.com/">http://www.beatles.com/</a> The Beatles].</p>

<p>After learning Michael was shot (there was no blood on the scene or an exit wound, the .22 lodged in his brain), Sara returns to the Tinsley House and deduces the gun was thrown when the dog attacked Lori. With little work, she finds it under the couch.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sara appears to be happy she doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with divorce.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:ada2fbbda8fbcb9a138fff362b3449ec">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Divorces are war. Sure glad I don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> That&rsquo;s like saying there was a second shooter on the grassy knoll, Nick! The Tinsley&rsquo;s only had one dog!</p>
