&lt;p&gt;In addition to her &lt;a href=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/advocacy/&#34;&gt;Advocacy&lt;/a&gt;, Jorja is very politically active. She spends time with the &lt;a href=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}/advocacy/artists-athletes/&#34;&gt;Artists &amp;amp; Athletes Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, fights for legislation for the protection of animals, and has spoken out against candidates like George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;egreetings-vote-in-november-2004:d8fd10315a38159787b5473d4c54ea94&#34;&gt;eGreetings: Vote in November (2004)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a webmedia ad showed up, narrated by Jorja, urging people to get out and vote in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this ad, which was available online in the fall and winter of 2004, spoke openly against voting for President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence was overwhelming, yet somehow it still seemed hard to believe. I was brought into the White House to examine the brain. They wanted answers, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; was supposed to provide them. The cerebral cortex appeared normal at first. I followed the large fiber tracks and looked deeper into the basil ganglia, amygdale and hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to the audio tape again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We got issue in America. Too many good docs are getting out of the business. Too many OB-GYNs aren&amp;rsquo;t able to practice their .. their love with women all across this country.&amp;rdquo; - President George W. Bush, Poplar Bluff, Mo., Sept. 6, 2004&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What on earth could he have been meaning to say!? I took apart the central nervous system, guial cells, neurons, and finally? found a crap load of hanging chads lodged within the limbic system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ll ever determine what he was meaning to say, but at least we can stop him from talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vote in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;democratic-national-convention-28-august-2008:d8fd10315a38159787b5473d4c54ea94&#34;&gt;Democratic National Convention (28 August 2008)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at the DNC in 2008, Jorja was briefly interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jorja Fox. I&amp;rsquo;m on CSI sometimes. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here at the DNC, I&amp;rsquo;m really confused. I&amp;rsquo;m in Denver. I just kidding! I&amp;rsquo;m here- I&amp;rsquo;m just honored, I feel so blessed I get to witness this amazing moment in history. Yes we can! Go Barak. Good luck, we love you. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
