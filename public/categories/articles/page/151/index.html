		<p>**1996 saw an &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of lesbians on TV compared to previous years: we were introduced to **lesbian twenty-something Rhonda Roth on the new (and short-lived) series <em>[<a href="http://www.afterellen.com/TV/relativity.html">http://www.afterellen.com/TV/relativity.html</a> Relativity]</em>, Paul&rsquo;s sister came out on <em>Mad About You</em>, Roseanne&rsquo;s mom came out on <em>Roseanne</em>, lesbian Officer Abby Sullivan joined <em>NYPD Blue</em>-and Dr. Maggie Doyle became the first lesbian to join the staff of the hit NBC series <em>[<a href="http://www.afterellen.com/TV/er.html">http://www.afterellen.com/TV/er.html</a> ER]</em>, then in its third season.</p>

<p>Doyle (played by Jorja Fox, currently on <em>CSI</em>) is a new intern in the ER, a vegetarian, street-smart daughter of a cop with a red BMW and no-bullshit attitude. Over the next three seasons, her extreme self-confidence and willingness to challenge authority occasionally get her into trouble at work, but her passion and willingness to help others wins her friends, too. In particular, Doyle and fellow resident John Carter develop a friendly and mutually supportive working relationship, and she also befriends (heterosexual) HIV+ nurse Jeanie Boulet.</p>

<p>**Doyle&rsquo;s passion, activism, and willingness to work around the system are established early on. **In the first part of the third season, Doyle alerts law enforcement to a pregnant woman who tried to drink her baby to death, and when chastised by [<a href="http://www.afterellen.com/TV/sandylopez.html">http://www.afterellen.com/TV/sandylopez.html</a> Dr. Weaver] for doing so, retorts &ldquo;How about this? If I get to testify against the bitch, I&rsquo;ll do it on my own time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In another episode, Doyle secretly uses the office pool to buy a bus ticket for an abused woman trying to escape from her husband. She also publicly supports Jeanie&rsquo;s decision to come out as HIV+ to the rest of the hospital staff, and when Jeanie is fired by the hospital in the fourth season, Doyle puts her in touch with a Gay/Lesbian Defense Fund lawyer and urges her to sue the hospital for discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>In true <em>ER</em> fashion, Doyle&rsquo;s sexuality is concealed for the first several episodes,</strong> **then finally **revealed halfway through the season in the February 6, 1997 episode &ldquo;Whose Appy Now?&rdquo; when Carter asks her out. She invites him to the shooting range with her instead, and while they&rsquo;re in target practice, she spies her ex-girlfriend Amy (a cop) and mentions to Carter that they just broke up three months ago and that Amy is &ldquo;jealous as hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is the extent of the conversation about Doyle&rsquo;s sexuality, and this is actually the only time we ever see a girlfriend or ex-girlfriend of Doyle&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><strong>On the surface, Doyle appears to be just one of many lesbian characters on TV without a life,</strong> the stereotypical television lesbian-in-name-only that was common on network television up until the last few years: despite remaining on the series for three years, we never see Doyle with a girlfriend, or even hear her talk about one after the target practice scene with Carter.</p>

<p>There are only two other times, in fact, when Doyle&rsquo;s lesbianism is even mentioned-in the beginning of the fourth season when Carter asks Doyle if she&rsquo;s showing favoritism towards the new female intern, to which Doyle just laughs, and then in the fifth season when Doyle comments &ldquo;guess he thought anything goes with the gay chick&rdquo; in reference to the sexual harassment she was subjected to by a male doctor, whom she later filed charges against. When asked by another doctor if she thought filing these charges would hurt her career, Doyle just shrugs it off with &ldquo;self-respect is a bitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>**There were a few other cryptic (and humorous) references to her lesbianism over her three-season run, <strong>which established Doyle&rsquo;s quirky personality, such as in this</strong> **exchange between a group of doctors and nurses in the third season:</p>

<p>Chuney: Malibu Barbie was my favorite, too.<br />
Mark: I was always partial to Ken.<br />
Louise: Ken?<br />
Mark: You don&rsquo;t like Ken?<br />
Louise: Too pretty.<br />
Doyle: I&rsquo;m with you, Louise. Ken&rsquo;s nothing but trouble.</p>

<p>And another one later in the third season, when Carter tries one more time to ask Doyle out:</p>

<p>Carter : You know, you&rsquo;re great.<br />
Doyle : So are you.<br />
Carter : Seriously&hellip;you&rsquo;re great&hellip;funny&hellip;beautiful, too. I don&rsquo;t suppose you would &hellip;
Doyle : Not a chance.<br />
Carter : Cheers.</p>

<p>And finally, in a scene at the end of the third season, Doyle quips to a deranged patient on a biblical rant &ldquo;No meat, no men-I&rsquo;m your woman!&rdquo; as she arrives to help him.</p>

<p>**No love life and only three references to her sexuality in three years could render Doyle just more **lesbian road kill on the television highway except for one thing: lack of a love life aside, Doyle is one of the most un-stereotypical lesbian characters in TV history.</p>

<p>A woman who isn&rsquo;t interested in sleeping with men, helps another woman escape from her abusive relationship with a man, stands up to the male senior doctor who is harassing her and encourages another doctor to do the same, and encourages her HIV+ colleague to sue when she&rsquo;s discriminated against. A smart, confident feminist vegetarian lesbian who isn&rsquo;t afraid to stand up for herself and others, an educated and accomplished human-rights activist who has a gun collection, a street-smart daughter of a cop who can be alternately tough and compassionate.</p>

<p>In short, Maggie Doyle is institutionalized sexism&rsquo;s worst nightmare.</p>

<p>And unlike many television lesbians who are clearly positioned as &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; in order to offset the potential threat of their lesbianism, you never see Doyle in makeup and heels, and the few times she does wear something other than hospital scrubs she is usually in something gender-neutral like jeans and a t-shirt (although this is typical of all of the female characters on *ER, *it is notable that Doyle isn&rsquo;t treated any differently from the heterosexual women in this regard).</p>

<p>**This kind of rich, complicated, and anti-patriarchal character is not standard fare on television, *<em>and not surprisingly, there have been few such lesbian characters on network television</em> <em>before or since.</em> *</p>

<p>Lesbianism on television** <strong>is</strong> **almost always divorced from feminism or from activism of any kind in order to make it as palatable as possible to the general public, since a feminist lesbian is the embodiment of everything American patriarchal culture finds threatening. Therefore, to create such a character on television is extremely risky; to make her a likeable character without compromising her feminist characteristics is a huge challenge.</p>

<p>Because this is so risky, lesbianism on network television is usually presented as <em>just</em> an issue of sexuality, in which television writers labor to reinforce the idea that lesbians are &ldquo;just like the rest of us&rdquo; except that they sleep with other women. This applies to almost every lesbian character on television in the last twenty years, but specific examples include the lesbian couple on <em>Friends</em>, Ellen&rsquo;s characters in both of her sitcoms, Rhonda on <em>Relativity</em> and Debbie Buchman on <em>Mad About You</em>, and almost every lesbian in a TV movie including <em>The Truth About Jane</em> and <em>What Makes a Family</em>.</p>

<p>And while this &ldquo;just like everyone else&rdquo; descriptor does accurately describe the way many lesbians see themselves in real life, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply to all (or even most) lesbians.</p>

<p><strong>Paradoxically, the persistent use of the &ldquo;lesbians are just like us&rdquo; messaging on TV <em>has</em> helped pave</strong> the way for more lesbian characters on TV, but it is also slowly eroding the connection between feminism and lesbianism. This of course is exactly the result television networks are hoping for, and the very reason they have propagated it; lesbianism without feminism is the ultimate male fantasy-and serving up male fantasy is what drives television ratings.</p>

<p>And while it may be that for many lesbians, their sexuality is <em>not</em> in fact related to feminism, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we don&rsquo;t want the television networks making that decision for us.</p>

<p>**In this environment, Dr. Maggie Doyle is not only an anomaly on television, but potentially revolutionary. **Unfortunately, this revolutionary potential is probably one of the reasons her character was never really fully developed on <em>ER</em>. Doyle was never a primary cast member, but over time she was relegated more and more to the periphery of the storyline, until she finally just didn&rsquo;t come back in the sixth season.</p>

<p>To make her a full cast member would have required devoting more screen time to her personal life and to the lesbian feminist issues she cares about, and while the writers at <em>ER</em> <em>have</em> pushed the envelope in terms of lesbian representation more than once, they are still products of their ratings-ruled environment in which lesbian feminists don&rsquo;t generate huge audience response. And if there&rsquo;s anything more threatening than a lesbian feminist on TV, it&rsquo;s a lesbian feminist in a happy relationship.</p>

<p>There have been other complex, realistic and even feminist lesbian characters on network television (including the current lesbian characters on <em>ER</em> and *[<a href="http://www.afterellen.com/TV/buffy.html">http://www.afterellen.com/TV/buffy.html</a> Buffy]), *and unlike Doyle, they are actually allowed to have on-screen relationships. But none have embodied quite the same activist spirit as Doyle, the same desire to take on the system; as long as American culture retains its sexist and homophobic roots, this may remain true for awhile to come.</p>

		<p><strong>Pizza to die for</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox sees dead people - but that&rsquo;s her job. As forensic crime scene investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, she determines the cause of death by examining evidence with high-tech toys. Forensic science allows the dead to communicate with the living and producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made it chic to be a science geek.</p>

<p>What viewer see each week, such as the path of a bullet travelling through a human body could put anyone off eating meat. Maybe we should take a tip from Fox and become vegetarians, which she&rsquo;s been for over 15 years.</p>

<p>And her favorite dish? &ldquo;Pizza, Always pizza. I think I&rsquo;ve been a pizza fanatic my whole life. It started in New York city, cause you could get dough from a lot of pizza shops there&rdquo;, says Fox.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need to knead, however, when you can beg, borrow or deal to your hands on the dough. &ldquo;I actually get the crust from one of my favorite pizza joints in L.A&hellip;. they sell it to me in a little ball&rdquo;, the actress says.</p>

<p>Fox takes her goods home where she employs simple cooking method to devour the evidence. &ldquo;[Because] I&rsquo;m a vegetarian, I make [my pizza] with soy pepperoni and sausage, and soy cheese, Cilantro and pineapple is my favorite, with a little veggie sausage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But be careful - that combination could be used as a lethal weapon.</p>

<p>Vegetarian Pizza with Pineapple and Pepperoni</p>

<p>1 12 inch (30 cm) pizza round</p>

<p>1 cup/250 ml pizza sauce or salsa</p>

<p>2 cups/500 ml pineapple tidbits, fresh or canned, well drained</p>

<p>1 pkg (4.2 oz/120 g sliced soy pepperoni, or amount to taste</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup /50 ml fresh cilantro, chopped</p>

<p>2 cups/500 ml soy cheese, shredded</p>

<p>Fox prefers to buy the pizza dough from her favorite pizza shop and sometimes uses soy sausage instead of soy pepperoni. Pour pizza sauce over pizza round and spread evenly. Arrange pineapple and pepperoni slices to taste on and sprinkle with cilantro and shredded cheese. Bake in the lower half of a 450 F (230 C) oven for 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Makes 1 12-inch (30 cm) pizza.</p>

		<p><strong>vegetarian girl next door catapults to stardom</strong></p>

<p>As a star on the top-rated CBS police drama <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, Jorja (pronounced Georgia) Fox as to watch what she eats. Not or health reasons- although nutrition certainly is important to the devoted vegetarian- but becuase of the show&rsquo;s sometimes gory realism. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned not to eat before certain scenes,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hardly surprising give the fact that Fox&rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle- a name that, she says, &ldquo;sounds a little too much like &lsquo;suicidal&rsquo;&rdquo;- works as a member of the CSI autopsy team. Her job? Examining the lifeless bodies discovered in the dark hours of the night in Las Vegas and uncovering clues about the who, what, where, when and why of their demise.</p>

<p>Sidle is just the latest in a string of serious, determined characters that fox has portrayed on the big and small screens. She joined the cast of <em>ER</em> in its third season as the gun-toting, vegetarian, gay resident, Dr. Maggie Doyle- &ldquo;No meat. No men. I&rsquo;m your woman.&rdquo; She appeared in <em>The West Wing</em> as special agent Gina Toscano, the dedicated secret service protector of the president&rsquo;s daughter. And in her most recent film, the critically acclaimed <em>Memento</em>, she played the murder victim, a role that entailed lying for hours on a bathroom floor, wet, covered by a shower curtain.</p>

<p>By following Fox&rsquo;s career, you might assume you know a thing or two about her from the characters she&rsquo;s played. You know the look: the tall, lithe brunette with the slight space between her front teeth. You recognize the voice: a hint of the tomboy all grown up. You feel the persona: girl always up for a wind-in-her-hair kind of adventure, followed maybe by a pizza and beed. And, yes, she is both an animal lover and a vegetarian, a detail that has been written into some of the characters she protrays.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Jorja Fox, it&rsquo;s true. But the person behind the role is someone else again- a distinct character with a storyline all her own.</p>

<p><strong>model citizen</strong></p>

<p>A New Your City native, Fox spent most of her childhood in Melbourne Beach, Florida, on a barrier island with the ocean on one side and a river on the other. &ldquo;My life was all about water- sailing, water-skiing, swimming, surfing. It&rsquo;s where I developed my passion for being outside. It was simply a wonderful place to be a kid. I grew up barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The family- which includes an older brother- had moved south to fulfull Fox&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s dream of living in a beach town. But they were a restless group, changing residences often and taking frequent trips to New York City and Canada, where Fox&rsquo;s parents hail from.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it was in Flordia that Fox met her destiny, winning by a fluke, she says, a modeling contest she entered as a joke. &ldquo;I was very, very, very shocked to win,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was a fish out of water becuase I wasn&rsquo;t a classic beauty. In Florida, beauty was all about being blond and tan. I&rsquo;m a tall, gangly, dark-haired Irish girl. I just didn&rsquo;t fit the bill.&rdquo; But her beauty was recognized nevertheless, and at 15 she won the oppertunity to live in New York City and give modeling a try.</p>

<p>After a summer spent living with another teenage model and a chaperone, Fox decided there was no going back. She opted to stay in New York, finish high school and pursue modeling. Her career focused primarily on print media- magazines in particular. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too short for runway work,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I only worked the runway when someone else called in sick.&rdquo; Another impediment to success on the catwalk? The once-barefoot girl &ldquo;could barely walk in heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From New York she went to Europe, where, she says, she felt &ldquo;fearless.&rdquo; Those years of modeling and traveling throughout Europe with peers were &ldquo;fantastic, a wilder dream than I ever could have imagined,&rdquo; she says. After a time, however, Fox decided that modeling had its limitations.</p>

<p>Returning to New York at 18, she turned her attention to acting, focusing on studying and auditioning. She adopted an eclectic approach to supporting herself: working at a kennel, as a temp and even as a coat checker in a downtown nightclub.</p>

<p>But her fast-paced city lifestyle never diminished her love of the outdoors, and she continued to run for exercise and bike just to get places she needed to go. &ldquo;I rode everwhere. It just seemed like a normal thing to do. Besides, I was broke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along the way, Fox began to examine the way she&rsquo;d been eating. A lifelong meat-and-potatoes lover, she constantly peppered her vegetarian friends with questions about their dietary habits. Then one day in Brooklyn- in the midst of consuming a meatball sub- she had an epiphany. &ldquo;I just got it. I made a connection. I started reading voraciously about vegetarianism, and got ready for the questions from others, like the ones I&rsquo;d asked my friends.&rdquo; Fifteen years later, Fox says eating a meat-free diet is just something she does without questioning.</p>

<p><strong>sweet success</strong></p>

<p>At age 19, Fox got her first movie role in <em>The Kill-Off</em>, a dark and disturbing independant film that was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. And soon after, other roles started coming her way. &ldquo;By age 25, I knew I could make a living as an actor,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>At 34, she has ample proof that she was right. Her resume includes stints on the best and brightest of what&rsquo;s on the small screen. in addition to her roles on <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>, Fox has also appeared on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, the &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; episode of <em>Ellen</em>, and in such films as <em>The Jerky Boys</em>, <em>Dead Funny</em> and <em>The Hungry Bachelor&rsquo;s Club</em>.</p>

<p>Now, Fox throws herself into the role as the work-obsessed, relationship-impaired Sidle, a hard-nosed scientist raised by two ex-hippies in rural Northern California. According to her character sketch, Fox&rsquo;s current alter ego &ldquo;can solve any problem except how she&rsquo;s supposed to relate to others.&rdquo; Her character plunges into her work becuase she&rsquo;s afraid of what she&rsquo;d have to face if she slowed down. She pursues the mysteries of death because those of life are more discomforting.</p>

<p>Fox&rsquo;s own character sketch would read quite differently. She&rsquo;s devoted to work and life in equal measure, and has no trouble connecting with myriad living, breathing creatures. She exudes energy, enthusiasm and, in contrast to her serious television demeanor, a light-hearted, let&rsquo;s-have-some-fun approach to life. Her passions are many- being outdoors, getting in her car and heading out on the open road, surfing, live music, spending time with friends and the company on her animals- two cats rescued from shelters, and one dog, a boxer aptly named Ali.</p>

<p>To keep up with all of her interests, coupled with <em>CSI</em>&rsquo;s grueling schedule- few weeks and often unpredictable hours- Fox needs endurance. When she&rsquo;s filming, she may put in five long weekdays plus Saturday, either on the set north of Los Angeles or on location in Las Vegas. Each workday can last anywhere from six to fifteen hours; her starting and quitting times vary greatly. &ldquo;Sometimes filming starts at 7 a.m., other days it starts at 6 p.m. One day I may be done at 5:30 p.m., other days 5:30 a.m. A lot of times I don&rsquo;t know in advance,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p><strong>health matters</strong></p>

<p>Given the demands of starring in a weekly television series, Fox has to be prepared for anything- and she is: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m adaptable. I like the flexability.&rdquo; Not one to adhere to a rigid routine, she has learned that she needs to respect her internal rhythms to keep up her stamina. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned to sleep when I&rsquo;m tired and eat when I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing she isn&rsquo;t flexible about, however, is her healthy diet. Although Fox was a vegan for six months when she lived in Chicago, that lifestyle is more difficult to adhere to lately. &ldquo;I work so much that I depend on others to cook for me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t eat much dairy, just a little cream in my tea, but I eat tons of eggs, now that they have cage-free organic ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the benefits of a vegetarian diet: &ldquo;I noticed that during the first five years of being a vegetarian, I felt much lighter, although I only dropped three or four pounds. I liked that lightness,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>But Fox&rsquo;s healthy habits go far beyond diet. She is, she says, a faithful reader of <em>Better Nutrition</em>, and she takes her own health very seriously. She&rsquo;s always careful to boost her immune system, particularly during the filming season. &ldquo;I take a decent amnount of supplements- a B complex, a mineral complex, digestive enzymes, astragalus and vitamin C. I don&rsquo;t want to get run-down,&rdquo; which is bound to happen with the schedule she keeps and the close quarters in which she works. &ldquo;The cramped stages don&rsquo;t have a tremendous amount of ventilation,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being at school and one kid shows up with a cold, and you just know everyone is going to get it. Same thing on the set. I hear someone sneeze and I say, &lsquo;Oh, here we go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also exercises when she can. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a gym person,&rdquo; she says. So when she works out- every other weekday and twice on weekends- she does it either in the fresh air of the privacy of her home. &ldquo;I put on a CD and dance for 45 minutes,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Her favorite workout partner is Ali, the boxer, who&rsquo;s always up for a run whenever she is, which more than likely is late in the evening. While the two of them often go for a run at 10 p.m., after working, you&rsquo;ll never see them out before the sun rises. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a morning person,&rdquo; says Fox, &ldquo;I wake up slowly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>on the go</strong></p>

<p>Despite the struggle to get out of bed each morning, Fox unfailingly shows up to breathe life into Sidle, a key player on the CSI autopsy team and a role that Fox embodies with pleasure. &ldquo;I love my character,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so smart. She&rsquo;s at the top of her game. Every day is a learning experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox is self-deprecating when comparing herself to the character she plays, denying that she&rsquo;s as smart as Sidle, who has a B.S. in physics from Harvard and did graduate work in theoretical physics. &ldquo;I just love being able to say that,&rdquo; she says. Unlike her alter ego, Fox claims that she has finite space in her short-term memory. &ldquo;As an actor,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t retain a tremendous amount. I do six scenes a day, and there&rsquo;s not that much room in my memory for more. I learn the lines, then I clear them out and learn others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, in fact, she has learned more that she lets on. After all, it takes skill to appear believable when conducting a dramatic rendition of an autopsy.</p>

<p>Having lived on both coasts, Fox is pleased with the peripateic life she leads. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit gypsy-ish.&rdquo; As long as she can be outside- at the beach, hiking- she&rsquo;s happy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I love running; you can do it anywhere. It travels well.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s also a dedicated surper, riding the ways several times a month, more during hiatus from her show.</p>

<p>During her infrequent breaks from fliming <em>CSI</em>, Fox devotes hersel to Honeypot Productions, a small acting troupe that she co-founded. This is where she truly expresses herself, she says, by writing for and acting in live threater. So far Honeypot has staged five different shows, two of them written by Fox and all of them performed outdoors. &ldquo;We put on plays that no one would pay us to do. We stage them in friends&rsquo; backyards.&rdquo; She stops to laugh. &ldquo;No one has volunteered a yard for next season, but I think there&rsquo;s one person who just might be willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Fox&rsquo;s skyrocketing career is any indication, those backyard plays are sure to launch into Broadway productions. Stay tuned.</p>
