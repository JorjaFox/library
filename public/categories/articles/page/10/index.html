		<p>FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS, WE&rsquo;VE BEEN WATCHING <strong>JORJA FOX</strong> ON OUR TELEVISION SETS. HERE&rsquo;S A LOOK AT HOW THE ACTOR SPENDS HER TIME OFF SCREEN, AND WHY SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF ONE LUCKY LADY.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox is really the antithesis of her television alter ego Sarah Sidle on the hit show <em>CSI</em>. Whereas Sidle is often sullen and dark, Fox is all smiles and has a bounce in her step that just makes you want to be around her. However both ladies are looking for ways to reinvent themselves. &ldquo;Sara got dumped by her husband last year so she&rsquo;s been grieving,&rdquo; says Fox of the character she&rsquo;s played in close to 300 episodes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s looking for ways to break out of her shell. I think we&rsquo;ve all been through a break-up; it&rsquo;s part of the peaks and valleys in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hoping to step outside of her own comfort zone and reinvent herself again, Fox has taken on the role of producer with the animal rescue documentary <em>Lion Ark</em>. The film reveals a historical move of 25 lions from Libya to a wildlife sanctuary in Colorado. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important to reinvent yourself over the years,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll act for as long as people will have me, however I also want to put my eggs in a couple other baskets.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>VEGAN WANNABE</strong></p>

<p>One area Fox won&rsquo;t be reinventing herself is her diet. The actor has been a disciplined vegetarian for the past 20 years. &ldquo;Eating meat-free is second nature to me,&rdquo; she says. Fox describes herself as a vegan wannabe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m vegan 85 per cent of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox eats healthy and considers rice pasta with vegan meatloaf her comfort dish. &ldquo;I made a vegan meatloaf a couple months ago. Unfortunately I blew it &mdash; it came out looking like chili,&rdquo; she laughs. &ldquo;It was tasty though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox does make minor adjustments to her diet in an attempt to improve her health. For example, she switched from early morning coffee to green or black tea. Aware that omega-3 fatty acids are important to her well being, Fox now takes a vegan source of omega-3s daily. She also supplements with a multi, pro-biotic and magnesium and calcium vegetarian capsule.</p>

<p>Early morning before heading out to work or surf, Fox has a green smoothie. &ldquo;Kale, lettuce, spinach, chard, a little fruit, and nuts for protein such as walnuts, almonds or cashews, flaxseed or chia seeds.&rdquo; She also eats a sweet something for breakfast. &ldquo;A cookie, cupcake, piece of cake &mdash; real sweet. It probably started with me having chocolate pop tarts when I was a kid,&rdquo; she says. Growing up in Melbourne Beach, Florida, the young girl never wanted to eat breakfast. &ldquo;My mother would feed me almost anything so I didn&rsquo;t go to school on an empty stomach,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I was a chubby kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Fox turned 13, she decided she didn&rsquo;t want to be heavy anymore so she became very focused on how to have a healthier weight. Several years later, she won a modeling contents (yet to this day she still considers that a fluke).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll always feel a bit like a fish out of water,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I felt like one in Florida my whole life. I&rsquo;m quite tall [five-foot-nine] and wouldn&rsquo;t trade that for anything, however there&rsquo;s a sort of awkwardness that comes with it. I was never typically what most people think of as attractive or beautiful in Florida &mdash; I wasn&rsquo;t blonde or curvy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While she may still feel atypical at times, Fox can confidently say that she feels a certain comfort in her own skin now. &ldquo;I love the California lifestyle of shorts, sun dresses and surfing so I&rsquo;m on the beach in a bathing suit. Then it&rsquo;s my black wet suit, which reveals all my imperfections. Yeah, I look like a total dork in the water on my surfboard with zinc on my face, and a hat, but I&rsquo;d rather have the fun experience of surfing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>AN OUTDOOR GIRL</strong></p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t just surfing Fox loves, she&rsquo;s an outdoor girl. Seizing upon Los Angeles&rsquo; temperate climate, Fox takes her exercise routine to the open air. With her rescue dog Bear by her site, Fox taks 45-minute walks every day &mdash; sometimes longer on weekends.</p>

<p>I developed a passion for being outside, so hiking, walking and surfing are year-round activities for me. Growing up in Florida, it was all about the ocean. As a younger person, I surfed for the adrenaline rush. As I&rsquo;m getting older, I&rsquo;m not into that anymore, however I really like the Zen thing of surfing &mdash; clearing my mind and just being in the moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox also hits the outdoors when she&rsquo;s in Canada. Both of her parents were born in Montreal, Quebec and she still has family scattered throughout the country. &ldquo;One of my brothers is an avid sailor so we go sailing a lot together up north,&rdquo; says Fox, who also loves to swim in the lakes. &ldquo;We also have some skiers in the family so that&rsquo;s always a fun visit in the winter months.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>FASHION BLUES</strong></p>

<p>Fox says she has a love an appreciation for fashion, however she appreciates it on other people. &ldquo;My parents were of that <em>Mad Men</em> generation, dressed to the nines every day of their life, loved fashion and they got this little girl who just wanted to be barefoot in shorts and a tank top all the time.&rdquo; If she feels the need to present herself in a certain light, &ldquo;sort of like I&rsquo;m mature, perhaps intellectual. I always go for dark blue, yet I love the blue tropical ocean color within the turquoise family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>SOUL MUSIC</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put my music into a category of guilty indulgence,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;Music is something I have never pursued professionally so it&rsquo;s an art form that I can be as silly and crazy as I want to and never worry about it being popular. That has saved me so many times &mdash; having music, which is just for me or just for me and friends &mdash; that&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think as actors we sometimes forget to have an artistic hobby,&rdquo; says Fox who has played the guitar since age 12. &ldquo;Music is more my story.&rdquo; If she were to write a tune about her life, what would the title be?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Luck. I know it&rsquo;s been used before, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d title my song.&rdquo; Nor Georgia On My Mind? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that thousands of time, especially growing up in the South. It&rsquo;s a song I love and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever get tired of hearing it.&rdquo; Still, with Fox&rsquo;s success and a peaceful existence, Lady Luck seems more fitting.</p>

		<p>HOW DO YOU DEFINE BALANCED LIVING?</p>

<hr>

<p>JORJA FOX</p>

<p>VIVA COVER GIRL AND STAR OF <em>CSI</em></p>

<p>Balance comes from the inside anbd I think it looks different for different people. What is balance for you and for me might be two different things. At the end of the day, if you are doing something you love, and if you can sleep at night, then that sets up a good equilibrium. An accomplishment and a restful night&rsquo;s sleep help to keep me stable. When I am out of balance, I either can&rsquo;t sleep or I can&rsquo;t get out of bed. To me, that&rsquo;s very telling that something is off.</p>

		<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;SHE plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle in one of most successful television dramas in history.&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yet actress Jorja Fox, who stars in CSI: Crime Scene Invesitgation, says how she first thought no-one would watch the show, which debuted in 2000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often thought of our show really as an action-adventure show &ndash; you are going to be in for an amazing ride, an amazing hour of an exciting, dodgy, what&rsquo;s-going-to-happen-next kind of ride.</p>

<p>To have reached 300 episodes of CSI is absolutely mind-boggling. It&rsquo;s a massive number and they all take eight or nine days. The math is crazy.</p>

<p>When I read the first script I was blown away by it. It was so different and I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything ever like it. Quincy was probably the closest thing that I could compare it to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost like I fell under a trance and I thought: &ldquo;A show about death? This is going to be cancelled in six weeks, no one is going to watch this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am so thrilled that I was wrong about it, but it was an adventure.</p>

<p>Even though I thought it was going to be a very short one, it was an adventure that I really was excited to take.</p>

<p>There is this word &ldquo;procedural&rdquo; that I feel wasn&rsquo;t really a word when we started. Law &amp; Order came before us and they in a lot of respects were kind of a procedural show, but I don&rsquo;t think the phrase had been coined until somewhere along the first or second season of CSI. It&rsquo;s a genre that&rsquo;s thriving to this day.</p>

<p>People, since time began, have loved mysteries and so in that way it&rsquo;s a very, very, old concept.</p>

<p>But one thing that happened that was extraordinary was all this technology and stuff was bumping up against the idea of the show at the same time and I think we found ourselves at this awesome moment in history where we could tell these stories and we could do it with all these gadgets and gizmos and evolutionary things that were coming out in the real world at the same time.</p>

<p>Being on a successful show is the coolest thing that could ever happen to a person. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything, but I think I show up because I love being with the people that I get to work with every day and get to see where we are going to go together and what we are going to do.</p>

<p>That hasn&rsquo;t changed for a minute even though the show has been through so many changes and losses. I will never give up on the idea of a musical episode. I know I have been plugging away trying to convince the producers for 14 years that we could really pull off an awesome musical, so there is that dream.</p>

<p>I think this show, is really about love in many ways &ndash; how through all this darkness and murk and ugliness, what really keeps these people going is love.</p>

<p>Love whether it&rsquo;s in a friendship, love in a romantic way.</p>

<p>I think (my character) Sara Sidle will always pine for Grissom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;How does it feel to be on a show that&rsquo;s clocked up over 300 episodes?&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing and it hit me today because I saw Jorja (co-star Jorja Fox) in the trailer getting ready and for her, she has been here for (over) 300 episodes. So to see the impact on her made me realise how powerful it was. You know, I&rsquo;ve only done 33 episodes, so I have such a great deal of respect for all the people that have made this show so amazing to make it last this long.</p>

		<p><em>CSI</em>&rsquo;s Sara Sidle, aka Jorga Fox, is best known for her life-saving roles on-screen, but off screen, Fox is saving animals. With Seafox Productions, the long-time animal rights activist and burgeoning producer, Fox is quickly mixing her two passions with growing documentary portfolio. Her latest endeavor, <em>Lion Ark</em>, has been nominated for Outstanding International Motion Picture at this weekend&rsquo;s 45th NAACP Image Awards.</p>

<p><em>Lion Ark</em> tells the story of Animal Defenders International recent Bolivian campaign to ban traveling circuses throughout the country. In the end, ADI helped relocate many of the animals to safe, forever homes, including airlifting 25 lions from Bolivia to a reserve in Colorado.</p>

<p>Some might recognize Fox from her earlier television roles â she played Maggie Doyle on <em>ER</em> from 1996 to 1999, and a * West Wing* secret service agent in 2000. But it was her animal rights activism that persuaded Jan Creamer (president of ADI) to partner with Fox. As an ADI ambassador, the actress turned producer couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled about the NAACP nomination.</p>

<p><strong>SharpHeels:</strong> How did you get involved with <em>Lion Ark</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Jorga Fox:</strong> Jan worked tirelessly on the circus bill, and then made arrangements for a whole country&rsquo;s worth of lions to be removed from Bolivia. I was invited to welcome the lions&rsquo; arrival in Colorado.</p>

<p>I learned they&rsquo;d been documenting the process. The people at ADI had been working round the clock and were considering giving the footage away, but once I saw it I knew it had to be a feature film and that I wanted to be a part of it. I was just lucky enough to be a part of the film as it unfolded.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong> Tell me more about your role in getting the film made?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> As the associate producer I didn&rsquo;t have much creative input. ADI put together this incredible movie. The part I got to play was that of consultant, financer, and cheerleader.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a very small-time producer, but my dream is to help people tell the stories they want to share. I look for topics that are fulfilling: human and animal rights, and environmental issues.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong> <em>CSI</em> just wrapped its 14th season &ndash; how&rsquo;s it feel to be a part of that?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It&rsquo;s been an amazing magic carpet ride. Never in million years would I have thought we&rsquo;d still be doing this, but the cast is incredible. There are pros and cons to being the same character for so long, but I love Sara. She lives a very dark life, but it&rsquo;s also very intriguing. She&rsquo;s almost like my alternate ego. Isn&rsquo;t that one of the biggest draws to acting? I never could have been in the secret service or CSI team in real life.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong>When did you start producing and how did you break into the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; of the business?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Some years back I was part of Honeypot, a tiny avant-garde theater company in LA, with four other women. But we all started working so much that eventually we disbanded. My first foray into production was a play on Dusty Springfield, so it was an easy shift.</p>

<p>I met the director for <em>How I Became an Elephant</em> at a party and â¦ I wanted to be him. I wanted to be a part of the film. Maybe that&rsquo;s what I look for because it was the same with <em>Lion Ark</em>.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong> As a producer, how do you use the business aspect within Hollywood to help further your cause?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It&rsquo;s a tricky thing, with films there&rsquo;s always a risk that it&rsquo;s going to be terrible or that no one going to see it. But if they do come out well then you reach so many people spanning different ages, backgrounds, even countries in just 90 minutes. And with that reach comes influence. I know music and movies have influenced me more than anything else in my life.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong> The NAACP nomination: what would winning this award mean?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> The nomination alone garners all the [nominated] films attention and makes it so they will be watched. Especially with the press the films receive.</p>

<p>With <em>Lion Ark</em> it&rsquo;s easy to think of it as a movie about lions, but people from all over the world came together for this cause. It was amazing to get the attention of the NAACP â they&rsquo;ve done so much human rights work over the years. Really, there&rsquo;s almost no animal issue that isn&rsquo;t connected to the environment and human rights issues. For us, the greatest gift is to be nominated. We&rsquo;re the long shot, but we&rsquo;re incredibly excited to be here.</p>

<p><strong>SH:</strong> Being a woman do you ever feel like you have to worker harder to get your message and your work out there?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I&rsquo;m really lucky because I haven&rsquo;t personally experienced this yet. But then the odds of making any money from documentaries are small.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have to let you know once or if I slide into the profit range</p>

<p>I do know that women/actresses still make less then men. Any great movie or television show has four to five roles for guys, and only one for women (and it&rsquo;s usually not as interesting). Fortunately, it&rsquo;s never held me back. As a producer I&rsquo;ve worked with men and women and been respected and appreciated.</p>

<p>I owe a lot of it to my parents and my father was an amazing male role model. They always told me I could do whatever I wanted when I grew up as long as I worked hard. As a producer I&rsquo;m just getting started. I&rsquo;m excited to see what the next five years will bring.</p>
