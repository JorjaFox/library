		<p>When teenager Jorjan Fox left Melbourne Beach for good, midway through her senior year in December 1985, she had no idea where she was going. Well, to New York City, for sure, but beyond that, it was a shot in the dark.</p>

<p>The resume was modest. She had taken modeling classes as a kid, done a little drama work in high school, and she&rsquo;d had a couple of brief glimpses of gore as an emergency-room volunteer. She couldn&rsquo;t hack math and science. Maybe she&rsquo;d be a rock star; she liked to play guitar. Anyhow, Fox left Brevard to chase big dreams in the big city.</p>

<p>Eighteen years later, the trail in the rear-view is bright and clear. Culture vultures know her as Dr. Maggie Doyle on &ldquo;ER,&rdquo; Secret Service agent Gina Toscano on &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; and, more recently, forensics analyst Sara Sidle on CBS&rsquo; brainy/macabre hit series &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; which just completed its third season. She had a cameo as a lesbian in the ground-breaking &ldquo;Ellen&rdquo; coming-out episode, and students of the arcane will remember her as the murder victim in Chris Nolan&rsquo;s nightmarish 2000 film &ldquo;Memento.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long way from Melbourne, but by phone from her home outside Los Angeles, Jorja Fox (she dropped the &ldquo;n&rdquo; at the beginning of her acting career) has fond memories of her formative years. She was only 3 when her mom and dad &#8212; Canadian immigrants Mark and Marilyn Fox &#8212; relocated to Brevard in 1972 from her birthplace in New York City. Dad sold paper products. &ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s dream was to live by the beach somewhere,&rdquo; Fox says.</p>

<p>Fox attended Gemini Elementary, Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy, Hoover Junior High and Melbourne High during her 13 years here. She was also a candy striper at Holmes Regional Medical Center, and her brother Jeff, 12 years her senior, was once a member of the Melbourne Beach Volunteer Fire Department.</p>

<p>Marilyn Fox died from cancer in 1996, and Mark Fox now lives in South Florida. Her only connections to Brevard these days are those occasional Mel-Hi alums who migrate into the California entertainment industry. For instance, she recently ran into MHS grad Kevin Green, a producer for the CBS reality serial, &ldquo;Survivor.&rdquo; The two used to ride the school bus together.</p>

<p>If minor, even capricious, decisions assume huge proportions with perspective, then Fox&rsquo;s half-hearted impulse to enter a fashion show at Melbourne Square mall in 1984 probably qualifies as one of the earliest connected dots on the road to Hollywood. Looking back on it, the 34-year-old, former punk-culture devotee can only chuckle. &ldquo;Winning that contest,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;was the fluke of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In several magazine articles supplied by a Los Angeles publicity agency, Fox stated that anger was one her easiest emotions to access for a role. Indeed, when she attended Mel-Hi, her attitude caught the attention of English and drama teacher Leslie Gabe. Gabe went on to cast Fox in two starkly contrasting productions: the romantic comedy &ldquo;Pillow Talk&rdquo; and &ldquo;Juvie,&rdquo; a bleak drama about life in a juvenile detention center.</p>

<p>&rdquo; &lsquo;Pillow Talk&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t seem like a natural fit for her,&rdquo; says Gabe, who worked Fox into the lead character played by Doris Day in the 1959 film. &ldquo;The only other role she&rsquo;d played was in &lsquo;Juvie,&rsquo; and the lead was a girl who was dark and angry. That was the persona Jorjan liked to project until you got to know her better. She had an aura about her, a little bit of a wall that kept people at a distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this day, Fox &#8212; who says she&rsquo;d never make a good crime-scene investigator in real life because of her squeamishness &#8212; isn&rsquo;t sure where that edge came from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in trouble a lot in high school, but it wasn&rsquo;t anything serious,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;Things like walking around with headphones on, which was against the rules. I didn&rsquo;t understand why. Maybe it was just being in a small town. There are a lot more ways to push the envelope in a small town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox calls Gabe &ldquo;a fantastic teacher&rdquo; and credits her for introducing her to the stage. In fact, the &ldquo;Pillow Talk&rdquo; experience landed Fox in a &ldquo;limited distribution&rdquo; film comedy called &ldquo;Tierra Tango&rdquo; some years back when the casting director turned out to be an avid Doris Day fan.</p>

<p>Today, in the lull between startup production on the fourth season of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; in July and the release of an indie film entitled &ldquo;Down With the Joneses&rdquo; (in which she plays &ldquo;a desperate, angry, used-up wife&rdquo;), Fox works on plays with a group of friends calling themselves Honeypot Productions.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s not much of a window to work with. &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t finish taping its third season until April.</p>

<p>And lately, there&rsquo;s a notion to master surfing, which is something she didn&rsquo;t do much of when she was living on the Space Coast. Maybe that&rsquo;s part of the reason why Fox &#8212; a pale, dark-haired kid who decided to compete in modeling against the more conventional, blond, tanned, surfer-girl types &#8212; regards what happened at the Melbourne mall all those years ago as something of a watershed event.</p>

<p>Now a serious vegetarian, Jorja Fox says she was &ldquo;obese&rdquo; in the seventh grade, and decided to change her look when she developed a crush on an older guy. She dropped the weight and got lean, but never fully bought into conforming to anyone else&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget when we were doing &lsquo;Pillow Talk.&rsquo; It was the first time anyone had seen Jorjan out of character, so to speak,&rdquo; Gabe says. &ldquo;She was wearing a dress and makeup and heels and everybody said, &lsquo;My god &#8212; you look so pretty!&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>So it was almost on a dare that she bowed to a friend&rsquo;s insistence and signed up for the mall competition. There were &ldquo;at least 200 people there, maybe more,&rdquo; Fox says. &ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t do anything to prepare. I was wearing shorts and a tank top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It went pretty quickly. She spoke to a couple of judges and did a turn. And she won first place in a field of stereotypes. The reward was a free photo portfolio, plus an opportunity to train at the Elite agency in New York City. But Fox didn&rsquo;t beat a path to the airport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I actually sat on that thing for about a year, because I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was something I really wanted to do. I waited until the following summer to go to New York, and I was up there on my own. I loved it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;After that summer, it was really hard to go back (to Melbourne Beach).&rdquo;</p>

<p>When her parents decided to return to New York in 1985, Fox eagerly followed them, even though it left her a semester short of graduating with her class at Mel-Hi. She went on to study at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she found her calling.</p>

<p>She broke through nationally in 1993 with cop drama &ldquo;Missing Persons,&rdquo; starring Daniel Travanti. The show was short-lived, but she made her mark. By 2001, TV Guide was naming her as one of the &ldquo;51 Hottest Stars on TV.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorjan was very, very smart,&rdquo; Gabe says. &ldquo;I could see her being a success in whatever she dedicated herself to doing. But I think of all the very talented and dedicated people who&rsquo;ve come through (Mel-Hi) and tried tomake it (in show biz). The odds are so against them. Sometimes I almost think you need something more. It&rsquo;s as if the stars have to be aligned for things to go so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For now, the erstwhile high-school rebel is apparently comfortable with her place in the galaxy. She shares workout tips with Fitness and Self, confides makeup secrets with In Style, and vamps in photo spreads for Stuff, which calls her &ldquo;TV&rsquo;s Sexiest Scientist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, when asked how she&rsquo;d advise kids to work through image problems through those jittery teenage years, Fox retains a soft spot for the misfits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s really important for you to follow your own heart about what you&rsquo;re really interested in,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Kids feel so much pressure to fit it, but it&rsquo;s important to understand that the things about you that don&rsquo;t fit in are what&rsquo;s really going to set you apart. It&rsquo;s what makes you special. Be yourself. People will notice. And they&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>CSI<em>&rsquo;s Jorja Fox has a simple plan: Don&rsquo;t worry, be hippie.</em></p>

<p>Out of the darkness of the <em>CSI</em> morgue, actress Jorja Fox lightens up as a guitar-toting, happy-go-lucky hippie.</p>

<p>*Between the loss of her mother and <em>CSI</em>&rsquo;s grim plots, &ldquo;I realize that the veil between life and death is thinner than I thought,&rdquo; says Fox &hellip;*</p>

<p>Ask Jorja Fox about the small gap between her front teeth, and she presses her lips together in mock sensitivity. Starting at 12, &ldquo;I worse braces for three years,&rdquo; says Fox, part of the crack forensics team on CBS&rsquo;s <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>. &ldquo;Then my wisdom teeth were supposed to come in and push them together. That didn&rsquo;t work. By the time I was 20, I said forget it.&rdquo; Good thing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her Alfred E. Neuman smile,&rdquo; says costar George Eads, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone wear it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She doesn&rsquo;t get to wear it much as driven, discontented criminalist Sara Sidle, on the top-rated show. Admits Fox: &ldquo;Sara does not have teriffic social skills.&rdquo; Unlike the actress herself, who enjoys clubbing and jams on electric guitar in a loft she and four pals lease as a studio. &ldquo;I prefer to stay on the lighter side of things,&rdquo; Fox, 34, says. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hippie,&rdquo; says costar Eric Szmanda. The vegetarian pleaded for a fake prop- &ldquo;which they probably would have done anyway,&rdquo; she admits- when a <em>CSI</em> script called for a decomposing pig. And on a trip to Yosemite, says her friend, commercial art director Andrea Campos, &ldquo;she actually hugged a tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox has embraced more roles than trees. Before <em>CSI</em>&rsquo;s debut in 200, she was familiar to viewers from three seasons as intense Dr. Maggie Doyle on <em>ER</em>, followed by a year as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on <em>The West Wing</em>. The success of <em>CSI</em> surprised her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think a show about death would do well.&rdquo; Of course, some viewers may tune in for her unfussed, husky sexiness. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got this Lauren Bacall thing going on,&rdquo; says costar Gary Dourdan, &ldquo;with that raspy voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That comment would have made her blush as a tomboy growing up in melbourne, Fla., with her dad, Mark, 79, a now-retired salesman, mom, Marilyn, who died in &lsquo;96, and an older brother Jeff, 46, now a financial sales manager in Atalanta. Living by the beach, &ldquo;I wore flip-flops to school until I was 13,&rdquo; says Jorja (pronounced Georgia- her mother liked the unusual spelling). She started acting in a local theater at 5, then lucked into a modeling contest at a mall while dressed in shorts and a T-shirt. &ldquo;I was a terrible model, awkward and gawky,&rdquo; she says. But work in New York and Europe paid for acting studies, and in 1993 Fox got her big break in ABC&rsquo;s short lived <em>Missing Persons</em>, shot in frigid Chicago. &ldquo;I wore so much winter clothing, my neighbors thought I was a construction worker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By 1994 she was enjoying the warmth of L.A. but in 1996, the year she started on <em>ER</em>, she considered going home to Florida after her mother was diagnosed withovarian cancer (she died that year at 69). &ldquo;But my mom wanted me [to stay] and have that job. She was a fan of <em>ER</em> and knew much more about it than I did. When I got the part, I called to ask her, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Dr. Greene?&rdquo; This was what made her happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have been thrilled by her daughter&rsquo;s latest success. Thanks to <em>CSI</em>, Fox owns a three-bedroom Hollywood Hills home, where she lives with her boxer Ali and is, for now, single. She may have avoided the dating game by taking her brother to the Emmys last year, but there was no getting around the red carpet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always the one with hair falling out, or I trip in my shoes,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be with me my whole life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>*<strong>Fox Rocks to Wake the Dead</strong><br />
After learning guitar at 14, Fox played in two New York bands in her 20s, &ldquo;but I always ended up owing someone money.&rdquo; Now that <em>CSI</em> pays the rent, she jams late into the night with friends- or on a soundstage with members of the <em>CSI</em> crew. &ldquo;When I act,&rdquo; says Fox, who also composes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m communicating other people&rsquo;s ideas. With my music, it&rsquo;s more <em>my</em> story.&rdquo; With a new chapter: She just bought herself a drum kit.*</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really had a good Grissom and Sara moment since that day at the ice-skating rink when he told her started caring about beauty since he met her. We&rsquo;re promised another key scene in their relationship on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.) when an explosion hits too close to home.</p>

		<p><strong>TV&rsquo;s No. 1 show finally investigates the team&rsquo;s private lives.</strong></p>

<p><em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> has always been stingy with details about the private lives of its workaholic characters, and they, in turn, don&rsquo;t know much about one another. But this &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; policy is about to backfire on forensics chief Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen). His crime lab will blow up in the May 8 episode, triggering revalations &ldquo;that are bigger than the explosion itself,&rdquo; says Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer of the CBS hit. &ldquo;A lot of emotions and truth will come to the surface.&rdquo; Grissom, who might have prevented the accident had he been aware of personal problems facing his staff, will be forced to deal with his own long-held secret- his loss of hearing. An unspoken attraction will also escalate, sort of. Teases Mendelsohn: &ldquo;In just one word, Hrissom will say more about his feelings for Sara [Jorja Fox] than he could in 10 pages of dialouge.&rdquo; &#8212; <em>Michael Logan</em></p>

		<p>The star of TV&rsquo;s top show, CSI, on marriage allergies, getting frisked and bad smells in the lab.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : When confronted with something gruesome, who is more likely to get queasy, you or your co-star Marg Helgenberger?</p>

<p>FOX : Me, for sure. Marg is one of the strongest and toughest women I&rsquo;ve ever met. Recently, while filming scenes for <em>CSI</em>, she has been in a meat market working with carcasses, walked through garbage at a disgusting landfill in Santa Clarita, California and worked in the pouring rain for days. She&rsquo;s a badass &#8212; she internalizes her disgust. When Marg, George Eads and I were at that landfill, Marg when into shock for an hour and barely said anything. We&rsquo;d ask, &ldquo;Marg, are you OK?&rdquo; and she&rsquo;d just not. George was trying not to get sick, and true to my Lower East Side New York City roots, I was screaming at the writers, &ldquo;You guys are fucking crazy! You fucking suck,&rdquo; for maybe 10 minutes. Because I&rsquo;m the squeamish one, they think it&rsquo;s funny to put me on the grossest cases, which they do consistently. That episode about the high school cheerleader who gets upset and eats one of her classmates? That was my case.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Any pranksters on the show?</p>

<p>FOX : We take turns. One of the crew members &#8212; who will remain nameless &#8212; brought in a remote-controlled farting device. I had a lot of fun with that. One day I was in every scene, and as a new actor would come to the set, I would use the machine. We got Billy Petersen while he was on camera. And I got Marg in rehearsal. But Marg has a 12-year-old son and she barely blinked. I thought it would get her so much better than it did. i acted like it was me who had passed gas and I just said &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, excuse me.&rdquo; She got it. But I was meaner with Billy and acted like he was the one who&rsquo;d passed gas. That fart machine entertained us for an entire afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Is craft service on <em>CSI</em> different from other shows?</p>

<p>FOX : There are several of us who have a hard time eating at work. If we&rsquo;re doing something disgusting, I have to wait until it&rsquo;s over before I will touch food. A couple of months ago I was working with Eric Szamnda and we were going through a guy&rsquo;s stomach contents. It&rsquo;s season three and we&rsquo;re feeling cocky saying, &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t even bother me.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve got this vomit on the table and we&rsquo;re picking pieces out of it, trying to decide what the guy had eaten. Then we broke for a meal, which was pizza that night, and we both said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, let&rsquo;s have a slice. That sounds great.&rdquo; We went back to work and were on the set maybe 10 minutes before we were completely nauseated.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Has the show made you more life affirming or more cautious?</p>

<p>FOX : Life affirming. it&rsquo;s left me believing that if it&rsquo;s your day, it&rsquo;s your day. I&rsquo;m not stupid about my own safety, but I&rsquo;d never want to be paranoid either. Death is very close to life. It&rsquo;s always hovering closer than we&rsquo;d like to think. But it doesn&rsquo;t scare me.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What other franchises are in the works? <em>CSI: The Hamptons</em>?</p>

<p>FOX : <em>CSI: Hawaii</em> would be lovely. The only one I&rsquo;ve heard of that seems to have credence is <em>CSI: London</em>, which would be an interesting show.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What does it say about our society that we can&rsquo;t seem to get along without a lot of shows about crime and forensics?</p>

<p>FOX : We live in a gray world right now, and some of that grayness is great, certainly where social and moral issues are concerned. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. That&rsquo;s what makes CSI so reassuring: It&rsquo;s nice to watch something and find out without a shadow of a doubt what happened. But the amount of violence in this country is horrible. Michael Moore, in <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> &#8212; one of the best movies I&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20 years &#8212; asks why America has such a thirst for violence. There are several good theories: We are only a hundred years from being a hunter-gatherer society. It&rsquo;s in our genes and we act that way in our daily lives. I also think people don&rsquo;t have enough sex.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Would David Caruso be welcomed on <em>CSI</em> or would he and Bill Petersen out-earnest each other?</p>

<p>FOX : I&rsquo;d love it if David Caruso were to do a show or two with us. I think he and Billy would have a good time together, though I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;d do it. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, David is welcome anytime, especially if he works with the ladies.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Have you used any special investigative or forensic skills in your personal life?</p>

<p>FOX : No. I prefer to use my intuition, which is wrong half the time. If I were to use too much information from the show, I would become Howard Hughes paranoid.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Have you ever asked for DNA samples from a date?</p>

<p>FOX : No. I hope I wouldn&rsquo;t have to, but it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s available. A lot of men finding out that they aren&rsquo;t, in fact, fathers, and it&rsquo;s a healthy thing for them to know one way or the other.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Are people creepier in real life or on television?</p>

<p>FOX : I guess that depends on where you hang out. People are creepy in real life, but there is something much creepier about people who are seemingly normal but can act like serial killers. But I have to cme to their defense because I&rsquo;m an actor. The schizophrenic positions that we put ourselves in for a living are pretty disturbing to an outside, but not to me.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Which star of a comedy show would you like to see as a victim on <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p>FOX : Larry David! I&rsquo;d love to see him naked in the morgue. I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I love his show. He&rsquo;s brilliant and funny, and it would be great to see him as a corpse.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : If the cast of <em>Friends</em> is worth millions of dollars per episode and they just sit around &hellip;</p>

<p>FOX : There&rsquo;s certainly hope for actors everywhere that there&rsquo;s no ceiling on employment.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What&rsquo;s the worst-smelling thing in the lab?</p>

<p>FOX : Burned human skin. Sometimes we wish the show were scratch-and-sniff, because we have to pretend that we&rsquo;re encountering bad smells all the time. Maybe that&rsquo;s for season four or five.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : You go home after filming an episode that involves a particularly grisly crime. What do you do to fix yourself?</p>

<p>FOX : Probably have a cold beer and a hot bath and I might have nightmares. Right now I really like Pilsner Urquell beer &#8212; a lot.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : We understand you&rsquo;re allergic to marriage. What are the symptoms?</p>

<p>FOX : Heart palpitations. And a feeling that I can&rsquo;t get enough oxygen. Cold sweats come with that. A burning desire to get into a fast car and drive quickly out of state. I have an inability to properly communicate, then the phone mysteriously breaks so I can&rsquo;t return calls. I hope to get over it someday, actually. I believe in true love and commitment and intimacy. That stuff is great. But, yes, I have this little problem.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Do you get out of paying for speeding tickets?</p>

<p>FOX : Who says I speed? No, I would never do that. Maybe there are a couple of things I would try to get out of if caught. But for the most part, I would take responsibility. I&rsquo;m not a huge speeder. I have a speed warning on my car. I set it at a certain speed and try not to go over it. But when I&rsquo;m in the car and the music is up, I could look down and be 20, 25 miles over the limit.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : For security reasons, have you been thoroughly frisked lately?</p>

<p>FOX : Yeah, actually, I have. Isn&rsquo;t it a normal part of air travel these days? I took a flight with Gary Dourdan and George. We were flying first-class from Los Angeles to Vegas and had one-way tickets. We were stopped at every possible point along the way, probably six times. Our shoes were off, our pants were rolled up. My shirt was up to here, the guys&rsquo; shirts were off. It was kind of fun to share that with two other people. I realize it was because of the one-way tickets. I support the airlines and the things they have to do to keep travel safe, but that one was a bit much &#8212; a threesome frisk. I saw parts of George and Gary that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. And that was comforting.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : We understand you can play <em>Stairway to Heaven</em> on guitar. Do you do any other solo tributes?</p>

<p>FOX : I have never been good at cover songs, mostly because it&rsquo;s so obvious that you can&rsquo;t play when you do them. If I make something up, I can fool people for a while. But the minute you offer up a song people know, they find out whether you&rsquo;re good or not. I can play a little bit of Van Morrison and Traffic, some Beatles stuff and a little Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I was madly in love with a boy in junior high who played guitar. I picked up the guitar because I thought it would be a way to hang out with him. When I stopped hanging out with him. I kept playing. I have a 1967 Rickenbacker hollow-body electric. It&rsquo;s beautiful. And I have a Yamaha acoustic, a brilliant guitar. It was a gift from some friends many years ago. Having a guitar that beautiful inspires me to get better.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Besides your name, what do you have alternative spellings for?</p>

<p>FOX : My mom made up Jorja. I spent the first 10 years of my life convincing people that I knew how to spell my name. Everyone tried to tell me I couldn&rsquo;t spell. I&rsquo;m not a good talker. I&rsquo;m not very verbal, so I don&rsquo;t have alternative names for most things. I&rsquo;m lucky if I can get something out that&rsquo;s more than two syllables. In English.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Has anyone made a charming play on your last name? And how did you reward it.</p>

<p>FOX : Yes. I stayed for breakfast.</p>
