<p>Question: Is CSI ever going to get involved with the characters&rsquo; personal lives? I love the show (no show can compare, in my opinion), but many people, including myself, are dying for some romance. Are they holding out on us, or are Catherine and Grissom just never going to open their eyes and see that they want one another? &#8212; Janine</p>

<p>Matt: I think the show is wise to make this sort of thing subtext, not put on the front burner. CSI is a procedural crime drama, first and foremost, and the worst thing that could happen is for it to become a workplace romantic drama (like NYPD Blue, which has lost much of its oomph and edge as its detectives keep partnering off with each other). Prediction: I wouldn&rsquo;t count on Catherine and Grissom ever making more than significant eye contact together. But CSI hasn&rsquo;t entirely been without a personal story here and there. Not long ago, Sara (Jorja Fox) learned her paramedic beau had a serious girlfriend after both were involved in an accident. I think this show is happiest when its main characters are at their loneliest. They live for their work, and that&rsquo;s why we watch.</p>

		<p>Variety puts a call through to California and speaks to Jorja Fox about what&rsquo;s fast becoming everyone&rsquo;s favourite crime series on television, C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation. MUMTAJ BEGUM dusts for prints and gets the inside story.</p>

<p>NO one was more surprised than Jorja (pronounced Georgia, like the US state) Fox when the television series C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation took off the way it did. Embraced by both critics and viewers, it was the highest-rated new drama in 2000-2001 in the United States. Its second season has been consistently amongst the top three TV series in the US primetime ratings and it&rsquo;s also the No.1 show on all of US network television.</p>

<p>Fox, who plays the dedicated forensic investigator Sara Sidle, says: &ldquo;When it first started, we didn&rsquo;t know if anybody would want to watch a show about science and death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 35-year-old actress reckons it&rsquo;s because death is not a topic many people are comfortable talking about. And almost every week, somebody dies a violent death in C.S.I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Science is always a hard sell except maybe when it&rsquo;s a big Hollywood movie. But these subject matters on C.S.I. were something different from what was on TV when we first started. Also, the technology is happening right now, we have the ability to do things (in solving crimes) that we couldn&rsquo;t do years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>C.S.I. revolves around a passionate team of forensic investigators that uses evidence at a crime scene to build up a solid case and ultimately to find the perpetrators. What&rsquo;s interesting about this show is that the team is made up of ethical professionals who never compromise their principles. This is especially striking since the Criminalistics Bureau is situated in Las Vegas, a city where corruption is not even a dirty word.</p>

<p>Another interesting element of the show are the special effects used in showing the details of a crime and the technology available in solving crimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much of the show we don&rsquo;t get to see. I only see my storyline; the special effects come in after. It&rsquo;s kind of fun for me to watch because there are a bunch of missing pieces that I don&rsquo;t get to see unless I watch the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching the programme has also allowed the general public to become familiar with terms like buccal swab (a sampling of the cells lining the inside of a mouth to obtain DNA), luminol (a spray used to detect traces of blood) and purge fluid (liquids taken from a dead body).</p>

<p>A recent report revealed that some people serving on juries in the US courts have a better perception of scientific evidence thanks to C.S.I. According to Fox, there is a good and bad outcome to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, juries are understanding better when a scientist explains evidence, but people are also going to the police and wondering why their cases can&rsquo;t be solved in six hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was one of the discrepancies pointed out by real forensic investigative teams when C.S.I. made its debut ? cases cannot be solved as fast as implied on the show. While a fingerprint identification search takes only a matter of minutes on screen, in real life it could take days to find a close match.</p>

<p>Fox agrees: &ldquo;We try to make the show as slick as we can but sometimes we have to cheat. Some of the procedures that we do on the show take a lot longer (in reality). But we use real stories on the show ? stories taken from headlines. Writers spend a lot of time with current events. And if something touches their heart they will also try to tell that story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In life things are never black and white. They&rsquo;re usually grey. In our show it&rsquo;s very rare that something definitely happened or didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crimes aside, there is very little information on the background of the characters. Once in a while, viewers are teased with tidbits like how Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) used to work as a dancer at a strip joint and how Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) once was a gambling addict. Nick Stokes (George Eads) is often frustrated at how slow his advancement at the department has been and of late there has been a certain spark between Sara Sidle and her boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah&rdquo; is Fox&rsquo;s reaction when asked what&rsquo;s up between Sidle and Grissom. &ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the tension between Grissom and Sara is going to continue for a while and it&rsquo;s going to have different phases. Basically, I think Sara does carry a torch for Grissom. But you have to ask what Bill (Petersen) thinks of Sara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who have been watching the new season on AXN would realise that the third season has a more personal touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not so personal because the show will always be a science show. Just a little history on the character, hopefully with some interesting personal twists and turns. I&rsquo;m very excited to see what the writers are going to come up with because the pressure&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes too much success leads to too many spin-offs. There is the first spin-off C.S.I.: Miami and now there is talk of yet another spin-off set in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Forensic investigation has also become a fashionable job. But is it something that Fox can do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never do it. I have a tremendous amount of respect for them. The burnout rate is very, very high, of course. They do the job for five or 10 years and then they move on. There is a lot of violence in this country (United States). And when you see violence like that, it&rsquo;s very hard to stomach. It&rsquo;ll make me a very, very angry person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An environmentalist and animal lover, Fox confesses she shares some similar traits with her character. Both of them are vegetarian (for non-violent reasons rather than for health reasons) and highly opinionated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tend to focus on something very attentively before moving on to something else. I think I have a lot of endurance. I don&rsquo;t have very good social skills. Sara&rsquo;s impulsive. She&rsquo;s someone who really, really tries to do the right thing all the time. And I think I do that too. I try to do that. In some ways we are different. I can never do what she does. I think she&rsquo;s very courageous; she&rsquo;s much smarter and braver than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is obvious is that Fox is very proud of being part of the show and working with its other actors. She even hopes to write an episode one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great thing about working on C.S.I. is all of us work very well together and trust each other&rsquo;s instincts. We are very focused when we work. It&rsquo;s very magical to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation&rsquo; is aired every Wednesday, 9pm, on AXN with repeats on Thursday (noon), and Sunday (11am &amp; 9pm).</p>

		<p>TELEVISION actress Jorja Fox is no stranger to violence: She plays<br />
criminal scene investigator Sara Sidle in the top-rating &ldquo;CSI: Crime<br />
Scene Investigation,&rdquo; aired on cable TV over the AXN channel.</p>

<p>But Fox, who has been exposed to numerous cases of death and<br />
suffering in the action-adventure series is against the ongoing US-led<br />
attack on Iraq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I send all my prayers to the people of Iraq, especially to the<br />
women and children,&rdquo; she told a group of Southeast Asian writers in a<br />
recent conference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is a very tense time in the United States,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Never<br />
have the citizens of America been this divided over an issue since the<br />
Vietnam War in the early seventies. I really hope that the split would<br />
turn out into something positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; which is on its third season, is about a team of forensic<br />
investigators, led by senior forensics officer Gil Grissom (William<br />
Peterson), and the crimes they solve with high-tech gadgets by<br />
assessing pieces of evidence gathered at the crime scene.</p>

<p>Fox, 34, who is based in California, describes &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; as &ldquo;an anti-<br />
violence series that presents people in the worst days of their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a show that has subjects most Americans would not want to talk<br />
about,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Despite the serious nature of the topics tackled in the show, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;<br />
is continuously garnering rave reviews in the US.</p>

<p>Fox attributes the show&rsquo;s success to the sense of security it<br />
conveys to its viewers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes it look very difficult to get away from some crime,&rdquo; she<br />
explained.</p>

<p>The show&rsquo;s producers hired a team of technical advisers and arranged<br />
for crime laboratories in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to be open for cast<br />
members of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; to use, according to Fox. This, she said, is primarily<br />
to help train the actors for their roles as forensic investigators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reading medical trivia books also helped me understand my role<br />
better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have always been fascinated with science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox landed the role of Sara in a &ldquo;very traditional way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to the audition, read a part, and then left,&rdquo; she<br />
recalled. &ldquo;I got a call from one of the show&rsquo;s producers a few days<br />
later asking for a meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After two seasons, Fox has learned to adapt Sara&rsquo;s brazen attitude<br />
and passion for work.</p>

<p>She used to get very queasy whenever Sara is made to stitch pigskin<br />
or examine the contents of the stomach of a dead child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is much smarter and courageous than I am,&rdquo; the actress said of<br />
her CSI character. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m as focused as she is when it comes to my<br />
craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox started acting at age six, and was involved mostly with<br />
independent theater productions when she was in high school.</p>

<p>She first appeared on NBC&rsquo;s top-rated series &ldquo;ER&rdquo; as the lesbian<br />
resident intern Dr. Maggie Doyle. She was also featured as the master<br />
thief Pallas in the futuristic film &ldquo;Velocity Trap,&rdquo; and Delmar<br />
Youngblood in &ldquo;Hungry Bachelors Club,&rdquo; a story about love and<br />
friendship.</p>

<p>Fox also played the role of secret service agent Gina Toscano in<br />
Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s Emmy award-winning drama &ldquo;The West Wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her role as Sara is one of Fox&rsquo;s prayers that have been<br />
answered.</p>

<p><strong>Would you enjoy a real-life career in criminology?</strong></p>

<p>I have no desire to do this job! I have a tremendous amount of respect and regard for the people that do. I feel lucky to have gotten to know a couple of people who are criminalists, and have the best idea that I can of what they do. It is very brave and very dark and very intense and very driven. I couldn&rsquo;t handle it personally&hellip; but I love faking it.</p>

<p><strong>Do you see death in a different light now, because of the show?</strong></p>

<p>That was the one hesitation I had about taking the role if I was lucky enough to get offered it. I didn&rsquo;t know if I would really be of sound mind, being in that world every day. I didn&rsquo;t know how death would affect me, or if it would get to me. In the first season in particular, I examined a lot of my own ideas about death, which I think was probably unavoidable. I realized that you either face it or are in denial. I&rsquo;m glad I am facing it, although my ideas are still evolving and changing.</p>

<p><strong>How do you relate to Sara?</strong></p>

<p>She is a renegade who has some problems relating to people on a social level. She is very, very good at what she does, but sometimes consumes herself almost entirely with her work. At the moment, she is also a little in love with a coworker who is very unresponsive to her &hellip; but I won&rsquo;t give any more away on that front! It&rsquo;s a joy and a dream to play her, but I sometimes get confused playing somebody for so long. When I go shopping, buy an outfit and look at it a month later, I go, &ldquo;Who bought that? Sara or me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Do you think criminals are scared after watching CSI: Crime Scene Investigation?</strong></p>

<p>I hope so, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a double-edged sword. On some levels we probably give clues on how getting away, but then we show how difficult it is to get away with something. It&rsquo;s getting to the point where before long we&rsquo;ll be able to catch people doing almost anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been some work done to raise money for crime labs across the country, and that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; Jorja Fox says. &ldquo;But it would be great if we could encourage the government to spend more money on this stuff. Then those crimes would get solved faster.&rdquo;</p>
