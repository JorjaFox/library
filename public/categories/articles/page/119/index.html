<p>After the surgery, Brass pulls through. Everyone is happy. It&rsquo;s how the episode ended that left me asking questions. Grissom was lying in bed talking about how he&rsquo;d like to die. He wants cancer so he has time to plan out and enjoy his last few months. At first I thought he was talking to himself&hellip; which I wouldn&rsquo;t put past Gil. But then Sara walked out of the bathroom wearing a white silk bathrobe! When did these two start getting together? I know it&rsquo;s always been there, Sara having the giant crush on Grissom and all. That was let out of the bag a few seasons ago. Seems like they both finally realized that life is short. I guess that&rsquo;s where the title came from though. Way to go Gil.</p>

		<p>Modest to a fault, Jorja Fox is gracious about what many would call the burden of fame and relentless scrutiny by the public that comes when starring on TV&rsquo;s top rated show. CBS&rsquo;s &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In general, I&rsquo;m only surprised that people want to hear what I have to say at all, about anything,&rdquo; she laughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always, you want to interview me? OK. Sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fox doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about her fabulous television career, doesn&rsquo;t want to pose for the cameras in yet another glamorous photo shoot. This isn&rsquo;t to be mistaken for the classic TV star brattitude of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to be me- where&rsquo;s my Perrier?&rdquo; Rather, Jorja Fox has more pressing issues on her mind. She&rsquo;s interested in equality for all, women&rsquo;s right to abortion, Hollywood&rsquo;s allergy to age, and the Bush Administration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I celebrated the death of the United States of America a couple of months ago,&rdquo; Fox announces, grabbing a beer and settling in to discuss George W. Bush&rsquo;s State of the Union address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud to be an American Patriot, and I&rsquo;m a capitalist, but I feel that the constitution I grew up with is pretty much null and void.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox numbers her reasons for why Bush should be impeached. The Patriot Act is number 16.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They stole the election,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Twice. There&rsquo;s a couple more reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The war in Iraq and the mishandling of Hurricane Katrina come in at the top of the list.</p>

<p>On the issue of equal rights for women and gays, Fox continues to be forthright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, here we are in 2006 where we supposedly have equal rights and [women] are still making a third less than most of the men in the country. And that&rsquo;s fucked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox then refers to Pastor Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas, who has a website called godhatesfags.com. Phelps and his supporters parade around the country to cheer at the funerals of gay people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute disgrace,&rdquo; says Fox.</p>

<p>As for the issue of abortion, Fox is struck by the view of the Religious Right that an unborn fetus has the same rights as, if not more than, every American Citizen, especially women and homosexuals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying to us that a little clump of cells has the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but not human beings that are alive and well and living on the planet.&rdquo; She pauses to take a puff on her cigarette. &ldquo;I take issue with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hollywood is also on her radar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman reaches her 30s and 40s, and the odds of her working, not even necessarily as a star of a film, but just as a bread and butter job- the odds start to decline rather rapidly,&rdquo; notes Fox. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the uglier truths of this town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A self-described &ldquo;rock and roll chick,&rdquo; Fox wonders what&rsquo;s supposed to happen to women like herself, not to mention heroes like Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt, and Melissa Etheridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I just going to grow into my sixties in my ripped-up blue jeans and my boots, or is there another way that I&rsquo;m supposed to look?&rdquo; Laughing now, Fox flashes her trade mark gap-toothed grin. &ldquo;Cause left to my own devices, I&rsquo;m going to look like Keith Richards.&rdquo; Which isn&rsquo;t to say that Fox is headed the nearest plastic surgeon&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw myself as someone that would want to be involved in this intense, losing, race against time,&rdquo; She reflects for a moment. &ldquo;It just seems really futile and painful and deprived&rdquo; She smiles. &ldquo;And I like my lines, I&rsquo;ve earned them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting aside revolution for a moment, Fox allows herself to be cajoled back into discussing her career and the fact that she has weathered the many storms of rabid media interest regarding everything from being fired and then rehired by &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; in the summer of 2004 during contract renegotiations to rumors that she&rsquo;s pregnant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a point in the year when it&rsquo;s been raining a lot in L.A. and it&rsquo;s not that easy to work out, and the Heineken six-pack starts to show up around the belly,&rdquo; She chuckles as she takes a sip of her drink.</p>

<p>Fox takes high notes regarding the fiasco of 2004, and skirts the subject disgracefully, instead of focusing on gratitude for her success of television.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in Vegas and I&rsquo;m at a slot machine and I&rsquo;m stuck to it, like my hands are really stuck to the slot machine, and I&rsquo;ve just been hitting it consecutively, for six years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox relates to all her characters, from Dr. Maggie Doyle on &ldquo;ER,&rdquo; to Agent Gina Toscano on &ldquo;The West Wing,&rdquo; to Sara Sidle on &ldquo;&ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; In spite of similarities between the three characters, Fox isn&rsquo;t worried about typecasting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all gun-toting, really cerebral, over-educated women,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I feel like if I&rsquo;m going to be typecast, then wow, thank God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Fox, developing a split personality when inhabiting the skin of another person is par for the course, even when the cameras are turned off and the crew goes home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like [the characters] caught a plane to Greece and married some guy or died,&rdquo; observes Fox. &ldquo;In some strange way they sort of still hang out there somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cites playing Sara Sidle as her &ldquo;greatest joy,&rdquo; and say she and the rest of the cast were stunned by CSI&rsquo;s breakthrough success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really thought of the show would fail miserably after eight episodes,&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;I thought nobody would want to watch a show about death on a Friday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Currently in pre-production for an original musical called &ldquo;Dear Bernard.&rdquo; Fox and her theater company, Honeypot Productions, are readying to take their play to London&rsquo;s famed West End, which is a huge step for the grassroots crew. The group, made up of old New York acting buddies going back to 15 years, has traditionally put up small shows in people&rsquo;s backyards with free booze because Fox feels &ldquo;&hellip;shows go better when alcohol is involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the revolution, Fox hasn&rsquo;t given up. As the bumper sticker puts it, she thinks Christian Right is neither. She feels the group is powerful simply because it doesn&rsquo;t play by the rules of decency that the Left continues to honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a professional activist by any means. I&rsquo;m just and actor. But it seems to me we need that next thing.&rdquo; She muses.</p>

<p>Fox believes that the fight is far from over, and claims she&rsquo;s not going anywhere until she&rsquo;s done her part to reclaim what she describes as the America she grew up in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams come true all the time,&rdquo; she smiles, stubbing out her cigarette. &ldquo;You never know when, but they do.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>CSI Colleagues Aren&rsquo;t Just Pals</strong></p>

<p>For years, fans of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; have been wondering: Is there more going on between Grissom and Sara than meets the eye?&rdquo; In the May 17 episode, we found out that the answer is a resounding &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now we have even more questions . and, as it turns out, so do the show&rsquo;s stars. *<strong>The Early Show* co-anchor Julie Chen</strong> talked to the cast of the CBS primetime drama about their characters&rsquo; futures.</p>

<p>At the end of the episode, we heard Gil Grissom (actor William Petersen) ruminating about the end of his own life. &ldquo;It would be nice to have a little time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;To see the Amazon rainforest. Read a few more books. Do another Sunday crossword. Time to say goodbye to the people I love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that point, a figure crosses in front of Grissom, a hand touching his shoulder in passing. Grissom&rsquo;s eyes follow Sara as she sits down on the bed across from him, wrapped in a bathrobe, her hair still wet from the shower. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness between them. It&rsquo;s comfortable. Intimate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ready to say goodbye,&rdquo; she tells her lover.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara, is curious, too. &ldquo;You know what? Honestly, Sara&rsquo;s never given up on Grissom, to be perfectly honest with you,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And that is the big question . how long has this been going on? You know, Hall and Oates do a great version of that song, and I think we&rsquo;re all wondering that same question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fans of the show have watched the sexual tension simmering between Grissom and Sara for a long time now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were doling it out in little tiny pieces, just between me and Jorja, so it&rsquo;s a big deal for me and her, just in terms of where we&rsquo;re at,&rdquo; says Petersen. With this latest plot twist, he says, everything has changed and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like a married couple in a bedroom at night talking to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clear implication, the actor says, &ldquo;is that we&rsquo;ve had a relationship for many years that nobody knows about, that we, even in our behavior around here, nobody would know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grissom might think so, but fellow super-sleuths Catherine (played by Marg Helgenberger) and Nick (George Eads) are far from clueless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that [Catherine] will be perfectly content just sort of watching it unfold and watching them trying to keep it a secret,&rdquo; says Helgenberger.</p>

<p>Nick&rsquo;s no fool either. &ldquo;He sees the way they look at each other,&rdquo; says Eads. &ldquo;He, I think, understands Sara very well. And I almost don&rsquo;t think he blames her. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t everyone just love Grissom? There&rsquo;s just something eccentric and weird and kooky and cool and awesome about Grissom, man!&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Oh snap! <strong>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo;</strong> better watch out. It has a lot of enraged fans out there after its Thursday season finale <em>(warning, don&rsquo;t read this if you haven&rsquo;t seen the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; season-ender yet)</em>:</p>

<p>I got this from reader Lisa Hennessy Friday: &ldquo;The CBS smash hit show has apparently been abducted and replaced by a &#8216;Bizarro World CSI,&rsquo; as seen in the season finale. We were treated to an unrecognizable Grissom, who traded his integrity for a playful romp in the woods with the sniveling Sara while his best friend Jim Brass was in ICU near death. We are supposed to believe that Grissom, who has spent the past six seasons avoiding Sara or sharing terse, tension-filled moments with her, has been lying all along and that they are longtime lovers. Huh?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suspending disbelief is one thing and &#8216;CSI&rsquo; does stretch credulity often, but this episode was simply a travesty. Poorly written and conceived, it has disappointed and even enraged many loyal fans. Paul Guilfoyle&rsquo;s ace performance was pushed aside for the Grissom and Sara Show, a pairing that makes no sense on any level.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never missed a new episode of &#8216;CSI&rsquo; but I wish I had missed this one and I doubt that I will be able to bear watching it in the future.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Holy schnike! The nookie is confirmed! While seeing a shot of Sara in a robe coming over to our dear Gil in bed certainly was no great surprise, it still made my heart race. I was kind of hoping the long, drawn-out pan around the room and the true answer to &ldquo;GG + ?&rdquo; would lead us to something more shocking (like Brass&rsquo; daughter, maybe), but I&rsquo;m happy to see this ending as well. A good handful of readers have said they would never watch the show again if Grissom hooks up with Sara. I&rsquo;ve got one thing to say to that: I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to your posts next season.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel about the show getting personal, if you are a CSI fan, you really had to enjoy this episode. From start to finish, this was a classic. Just the first two minutes had me totally jazzin&rsquo; for the rest. Before I could finish my cheeseburger (well OK, so it was a double) Brass gets paddled and we see a body with no head. It was a creepy yet riveting opening sequence. Top that off with a third victim and you&rsquo;ve got what made this show great in the first place &#8212; bodies!</p>

<p>I relate in some weird way to that third guy who died of, well&hellip; sex, drugs, and rock and roll, I suppose. Music blastin&rsquo; till 7 am, partying hard all night&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always figured I was going to go out like that, too . except it would probably be sex with myself, Zocor and the latest Clay Aiken record. As long as I&rsquo;m not found in my &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Aiken for Clay&rdquo; T-shirt, I&rsquo;ll be sort of OK with that ending. I mean, who wants to die and have high cholesterol?</p>

<p>There were some really funny moments again in this one, too. When Dr. Robbins says the victim had sex in every orifice &#8212; the joke between him and Catherine was that he &ldquo;died with a smile on his face, among other things.&rdquo; I thought Grissom and Sara counting off the 10 steps and dueling with cameras was kind of cute as well. What&rsquo;s not cute? A man in a corset. Having lived near Gettysburg for part of my life, I&rsquo;ve witnessed a war reenactment before and they are really cool to see, but you just know that somewhere in the slew of actors taking part, there&rsquo;s got to be one guy taking the whole thing a little too seriously. Sort of like our decapitated friend.</p>

<p>Finally, how about those clues. Other than Gris, did anything else get addressed? If so, I missed them all. I got sucked into this photo frenzy last week for nothing. Well, except for the simple fact that I couldn&rsquo;t wait for this episode to begin. I suppose it served its purpose then.</p>

<p>No matter, it was an awesome ending to an up-and-down season. I&rsquo;m looking forward to your comments expressing outrage over the last 10 seconds of the show, and I&rsquo;ll see you all in the fall when Season 7 begins.</p>
