		<p>Over 14 seasons and 300 episodes, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has concocted some wild plots and brought in memorable guest stars to keep the body-bagging business fresh and fun. We asked the cast - including Marg Helgenberger, who reprises her role as Catherine Willows for Wednesday&rsquo;s landmark 300th episode, which flashes back to a case the team failed to crack in 2000 - to reflect on the show&rsquo;s best installments, selected by longtime executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;1. Blood Drops (Season 1, Episode 7)&ldquo;&rsquo; A 6-year-old Dakota Fanning plays the surviving daughter of a family that&rsquo;s been butchered in their home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nightmares frm time to time about this one,&rdquo; admits Jorja Fox (Sara). &ldquo;Grissom [William Petersen] and Sara arrived so quickly after the murders that you could still feel the horrible events. I had one line - &#8216;Her soul&rsquo;s still in the room&rsquo; - which has stayed with me as [emblematic] of the entire series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;7. Law of Gravity (Season 7, Episode 15)&ldquo;&rsquo; A cop threatens to expose the dark past of fill-in boss Keppler (Liev Schreiber) if he doesn&rsquo;t make the evidence in a case go away. &ldquo;What a joy it was to have Liev with us for four episodes when Billy [Petersen] went to Chicago to do a play,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;But we all knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well for Keppler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;10. CSI on Fire (Season 13, Episode 8)&ldquo;&rsquo; A mass grave in the desert is linked to an accused serial killer whom Finlay (Elisabeth Shue) pursued when she worked in Seattle. &ldquo;Once in a while, the case is so close to your character that you get emotionally connected, which makes for deeper, richer scenes,&rdquo; says Shue, who adds that she enjoyed making out with Finlay&rsquo;s ex-husband (Cougar Town&rsquo;s Brian Van Holt) at the end of the episode. According to Fox, &ldquo;This storyline will come back later this season, when Fin will have to confront her past in Seattle so she can bravely help out Greg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CSI airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox is best known for her role as Dr. Maggie Doyle in the television medical drama <em>ER</em>. Since then, Fox has had many successful appearances in television shows including <em>The West Wing</em> and most recently <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> playing Sara Sidle. Fox talks about her career, how <em>CSI</em> changed her life, and what fans could expect this season.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What does it feel like to reflect on your career and know that you have been on some of the biggest shows in history like <em>ER</em></strong></p>

<p>Fox: Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. I started on ER in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. People had to actually turn on the TV at the right time a lot of the bigger shows people wanted to watch live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. I hadnt watched ER and it was my moms favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor and that I wasnt a good actorits just crazy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: So after <em>ER</em> you did a ton of television shows and then you land <em>CSI,</em> which again is another huge show. Where was your mind set when you heard you got the role of Sara?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: That was also a big surprise. I really didnt think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was really different and something that I hadnt really read about oftenbut I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do and I was so wrong about that. I thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How has Sara changed from Season one to Season thirteen?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think in someways she really hasnt changed that much [laughs]. When we met Sara in 2000 I think she was very much a product of her past and her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be apart of CSI that stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7 and was gone most of season 8 she had a time to wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself. Here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of how I have been playing the character.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What can fans look forward to this season?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think so far we are in the middle of episode 7. I think we have an amazing season opening up and some great guest stars like oh you know what I dont know if I could say. We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff  I think the writers this year again suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper. We start the season with a funeral and its not really until we get to the end of the episode that we find out why we are all there and whose funeral it is, who has passed. Its a very compelling and suspenseful episode.</p>

		<p>The 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.</p>

<p>A cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.</p>

<p>The evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series. The actor, who also appeared on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and in a story arc on &ldquo;The West Wing,&rdquo; seems to have a knack for connecting with popular television dramas.</p>

<p>Fox was in Hawaii to promote the documentary &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; along with producers/filmmakers/activists Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, founders of Animal Defenders International.</p>

<p>The film depicts the rescue of 25 African lions from Bolivian circuses, in the wake of a 2010 law prohibiting the use of animals in traveling shows. Phillips and Creamer, whove made their first full-length film with &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; were right there every step of the way.</p>

<p>The subject matter is dramatic and gripping  the quest brought the filmmakers into remote parts of Bolivia, and often circuses were not cooperative. In the films opening scenes, a circus operator, waving a knife, slashes their tires to try to prevent a rescue.</p>

<p>It also has a happy ending, as Fox and the filmmakers take pains to point out: All of the lions at risk were airlifted out of Bolivia, finding a home at a sprawling sanctuary in Colorado, where a giant (80-acre) protective enclosure was custom-built for the lions to help them adjust to the colder climate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to think of it as an action-adventure-dramedy,&rdquo; Fox said, partially joking. &ldquo;There are some funny moments in it, but there is epic drama. To get to be a part of it was fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox was there as the lions were being taken to shelter in Colorado, as is seen in the film.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be surrounded by 25 roaring lions  that real, raw power was an experience Ill never forget,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Creamer can speak passionately about the mistreatment imposed on animals in traveling circuses, while Phillips emphasizes their work is based on strictly factual findings  often uncovered by working surreptitiously to gather evidence on the scene, as the filmmakers did for years in Bolivia.</p>

<p>FOX HAS worked with Phillips and Creamer for more than seven years, beginning with a collaboration on the short documentary film, &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant.&rdquo; Fox served as producer for that film, which exposes the treatment of elephants as &ldquo;performers&rdquo; in traveling shows and in movies.</p>

<p>Fox was involved with &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; from the beginning, consulting with the filmmakers on the eye-witness approach and stepping in front of the camera during scenes films when the lions arrive in Colorado.</p>

<p>Shes also supporting the film by appearing at HIFF. Shell be at Dole Cannery on Saturday, Oct. 12, for the screening of &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ive been passionate about the environment, marine protection and wildlife, all my life,&rdquo; Fox said, explaining why she got involved. Born in New York City, she lived in Melbourne, Florida with her family as a child. Now based in L.A., shes a surfer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very familiar with Hawaii, but I wasnt that familiar with the festival until Jan and Tim got invited to come,&rdquo; Fox confided.</p>

<p>As she spoke, a stylish woman with close-cropped hair leaned over our table to say, &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, but we love your show. I just had to come over and tell you that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE SHOW, of course, is &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; which is about to reach a huge milestone: the airing of its 300th episode.</p>

<p>The episode has already been filmed, Fox said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its going to be amazing, thats all I can say,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We didnt really think it was that big a deal until we started shooting it, and then we started realizing that its pretty rare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the new shows especially, so many of them are doing 13 episodes a season instead of 24  its going to take them 26 years to get to 300 episodes! I dont know that that many new shows are going to get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried to enjoy every minute&rdquo; of filming, she said. Special care was taken in writing the scenes, and some pieces of the episode pay tribute to the series long history, including &ldquo;faux-back&rdquo; segments that recreate characters storylines reaching back to the shows first year. Original cast member Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) is also back for the 300th show.</p>

<p>I asked Fox how long the wild ride that has been &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; can last, and she responded that its up to viewers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope my favorite episode is yet to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Its lasted far longer than I ever anticipated.  Now, I think Ill do it as long as the fans want us to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cant even imagine leaving at this point. It would seem foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IN THE MEANTIME, Fox is hoping for big audiences and international impact with &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo; The film was just awarded the Audience Award at the San Diego Film Festival, where it sold out its screening. Screenings also sold out at Londons Raindance Film Festival, an offshoot of Robert Redfords Sundance Film Festival in Colorado.</p>

<p>Asked what she learned from working on &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; Fox said, &ldquo;Anything is possible. If you put your heart and soul to it, you can move mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hawaiian Humane Society has teamed up with Animal Defenders International to promote &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; at HIFF. For more on efforts to improve conditions for captive or domesticated animals here in Hawaii, go to hawaiianhumane.org.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Is there any chance of Grissom popping up in <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s 300th episode? &ldquo;Selena&rdquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;ADAM:&ldquo;&rsquo; In the flesh? Nah. But the episode, which flashes back to a 14-year-old case, does feature a full-circle shout-out to the man who started it all. &ldquo;[The writers] pay a very sound and beautiful homage to [Grissom],&rdquo; Jorja Fox says. Speaking of Grissom, how is Sara handling the couple&rsquo;s separation this season? &ldquo;Sara is too young to sleep alone,&rdquo; Fox says. &ldquo;As painful as it is to not be with Grissom anymore, the idea of also being with the ghost of Grissom is really lonely and alienating.&rdquo; Does that mean she&rsquo;ll be sharing her bed with someone else? Not exactly. &ldquo;Sara is always going to be in love with Grissom. She&rsquo;s always going to pine for him and her heart is always, in a certain way, going to belong to him,&rdquo; Fox says.</p>

		<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox answer burning questions about Sara&rsquo;s return and the crime show&rsquo;s killer new season&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he most baffling crime on <em>CSI</em> last season wasn&rsquo;t a stabbing or shooting. It was a missing persons case: The show&rsquo;s lead investigator for its first nine seasons, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), left the series halfway through the year, sending <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s ratings slipping and causing concern for its cast and producers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We look at last season in a way not dissimilar from the fans,&rdquo; admits executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. &ldquo;We may have shortchanged a number of our characters in being focused on the transition from Grissom&rsquo;s team to Catherine&rsquo;s. We;ll try to make up for that this season.</p>

<p>From the opening scene, it&rsquo;s clear the mood is deadly on the graveyard shift. The team is &ldquo;fractured,&rdquo; says Mendelsohn. Enter Jorja Fox, who&rsquo;s back, at least temporarily, to help Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) get the CSIs to play nice again. But where&rsquo;s Grissom? &ldquo;The audience will know in very short order the status of Grissom and Sara,&rdquo; Mendelsohn promises. &ldquo;I can say that between the time they left and now, there are no little Grissoms out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both Nick Stokes (George Eads) and Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) get promoted and start a season-long hunt for a serial killer. &ldquo;The crime scene for this killer <em>is</em> a body,&rdquo; says Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>The case may also be just the thing to bring the team together and feeling like a family again. &ldquo;We were out of our rhythm a bit last year,&rdquo; says Eads. &ldquo;We needed to go back to the garage and find what inspired us, and there&rsquo;s some good stuff with what&rsquo;s happening on the show now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That starts with the return of Fox, whose departure two seasons ago &ldquo;felt like we lost our lead guitarist,&rdquo; Eads adds. So, as <em>CSI</em> tunes up for its 10th season, <strong>TV GUIDE MAGAZINE</strong> sat down with Fox and Helgenberger to ask them questions send in by fans on [<a href="http://tvguidemagazine.com">http://tvguidemagazine.com</a> tvguidemagazine.com], and found out how the team is getting its mojo back.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What would you like to see this year on <em>CSI</em> that hasn&rsquo;t already been done?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> A musical episode! That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve talked about since Season 2. The cast has, anyway. I don&rsquo;t think the writers think it&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been advocating for the <em>CSI</em> musical episode for a long time. And not because I have any talent musically, because I don&rsquo;t. Everybody else does. Marg has a beautiful voice.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> You do, too, have talent.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I can&rsquo;t really sing. But I&rsquo;d love a dance number.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja, why did you come back to <em>CSI</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I thought it would be a heck of a lot of fun. When I said my goodbyes, with cake in my mouth and flowers in my arms, the last thing I said to the producers was I&rsquo;d love to visit. But this was very unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible Sara will return for good?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;ll just say I&rsquo;m very pleased with what they&rsquo;ve come up with to bring Sara back. You do learn a little about what she&rsquo;s been up to. I was pleasantly intrigued.</p>

<p><strong>Marg, are you happy to have Jorja back on the set so you&rsquo;re not the only woman?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna cover my ears!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Well, obviously, Lauren Lee Smith [<em>who played Riley Adams</em>] was with us last year, but there was a time before she joked us that I was the only woman, for the most part, other than Liz Vassey in the lab and Sheeri Rappaport. Not that I minded being around all these guys, &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re all really great and cool and sexy and all that stuff. but there needed to be more of a presence of female power. So I was thrilled to have Jorja back. She&rsquo;s just the coolest chick on the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine and Sara have never really had a close friendship. Will they become closer?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always wanted them to have a closer relationship. I liked the characters&rsquo; energies together. So it hasn&rsquo;t been for a lack of me wanting and asking for it. I hope it happens. We do have a couple nice scenes in the first episode.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I know very little about where we&rsquo;re going from here. Sara has pretty obvious authority issues, so when she&rsquo;s locked horns with Catherine, it&rsquo;s because Catherine&rsquo;s in a position to tell Sara what to do. In her mind, Sara believes she doesn&rsquo;t have a boss. She is her own boss. Most of their fights come out of that. They&rsquo;re very different women but blend marvelously together.</p>

<p><strong>Will we see more of Catherine as a strong supervisor this season?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Yes, you will. There is something that happens in the first episodes because someone leaks information to the press, [and the] hard-ass on the show, Ecklie [<em>Mark Vann</em>], has to come down on someone, so it&rsquo;s the leader. I think you&rsquo;ll see Catherine on top of her game, confident.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Catherine&rsquo;s had a leadership position on the show for some time. So it&rsquo;ll seem sort of seamless and subtle. But for me, it&rsquo;s exciting to see a woman in charge.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be a Grissom and Sara wedding anytime soon?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I have no idea if there&rsquo;ll be a wedding! Would I, as Jorja, like to see one? Sure. I think, even though it seems the antithesis of who Sara is, she&rsquo;d like to see one too.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think happened between Grissom and Sara after the screen went black at the end of William Petersen&rsquo;s final episode?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I think we left them happily ever after in a Costa Rican rain forest. I certainly would love to leave it at that. I liked that moment being suspended for a while. It was so slow in coming, season after season. It was something I was rooting for, and I was happy the story ended the way it did. So just let it hang there for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Will we see Catherine find love in the future?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] I think it&rsquo;s way overdue for Catherine to have a love interest! There was an ex, who was shot dead. I had a brief relationship with a guy who just wasn&rsquo;t right for me. There was the whole Warrick [<em>Gary Dourdan</em>] flirtation thing that we didn&rsquo;t really follow through on. But I&rsquo;d love to see Catherine&rsquo;s vulnerable side.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> And to see some sparks fly!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Catehrine needs somebody tall and dark. She&rsquo;s always attracted to edgy-type guys, but at this point in her life and career, she knows that&rsquo;s heading into dangerous water. I think she&rsquo;s evolved a little bit. Not that she wants somebody who is milquetoasty.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] A foot doctor?</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Sure. He probably gives great foot massages. Which would be quite sensual. [<em>Laughs</em>] She does stand on her feet a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Would Catherine ever kiss Sara?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> We did today! At the TV Guide Magazine photo shoot. But on the show, probably not. Sara and Catherine love each other very much, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t kiss.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> We have to keep some mystery.</p>

<p><strong>Will we get to see Catherine&rsquo;s daughter, Lindsey, and her mother this season?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have my daughter be much more of a presence on the show, especially now that she&rsquo;s a young woman. That allows for some great storytelling. I can only hope there will be more.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be any more about Catherine&rsquo;s father, Sam Braun, and his legacy?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> That will definitely be there. Definitely that old-school Vegas stuff will be throughout the whole season.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the funniest thing that ever happened on the set?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Back when we were doing the &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo; episode, and George [Eads] was in the box where he&rsquo;s dying every minute he&rsquo;s in there &hellip; we get this tape in the mail from the Killer and it&rsquo;s a Turtles song. The camera&rsquo;s going around all of us, and we&rsquo;re all there. We&rsquo;re trying to analyze this tape, a critical moment in the story, and we all hear the music and start dancing to it.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> The musical episode!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Exactly!</p>

<p><strong>Do you two hang out together off set?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I keep meaning to go down to watch her surf.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I just spent four days doing it. I&rsquo;ve been surfing for about eight years.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been down to her place but haven&rsquo;t seen her surf yet. I guess I might try doing it, too, but I&rsquo;m not as brave as she is.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Oh, boy, that&rsquo;s not true!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] The temperature of the water is what I&rsquo;m most afraid of. If I was in Hawaii, I&rsquo;d love to do it with you.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Great! Let&rsquo;s go to Hawaii and go surfing.</p>

<p><strong>Would either of you consider joining <em>Dancing With the Stars</em> since you have the moves to blow the minds of America every week?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I could see where that would be a lot of fun, actually.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Would America be ready for dancing forensic investigators?</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> See? It all comes back to <em>CSI: The Musical</em>. Every question comes back to that. If we keep putting it out there, it&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
