		<p>&ldquo;My six-pack is not like most actresses&rsquo; &#8212; my six-pack is beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>From gritty crime scenes to sexy love scenes, JORJA FOX&rsquo;s role on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has been through a lot of changes due to her new romance.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WITH HER TOMBOYISH</strong> demeanor and love of rock music, surfing, beer and dogs, no one, least of all actress Jorja Fox, would have predicted that she&rsquo;d be in one of the most talked-about love affairs on TV this season. But as one of the stars of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, Jorja has given the CBS drama a hot new look, with her character, Sara Sidle, going from crime scenes to love scenes. Her surprising romance with fellow forensics investigator Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen) is keeping fans guessing at the snow near the top of the ratings in its Thursday-night battle against ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really exited about the thing between Grissom and Sara,&rdquo; Jorja told &ldquo;OK!&rdquo;. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s not sexy about William Petersen? Going into the seventh year of a show, to have something so big and so different to play after all this time is very unique and rare. We&rsquo;re having a ball. I hope the fans love it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A self-described hippie, Jorja often comes to work with her best friend, her dog Ali. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy for animals. I love them!&rdquo; Jorja said when we caught up with her at the Oct. 5 opening of the North Central Animal Care Center, a remodeled Los Angeles city shelter for dogs, cats and rabbits. Jorja couldn&rsquo;t be happier that the city has created a clean, safe facility where solar panels keep pets warm and a misting system keeps them cool until they can be adopted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the shelter a number of times,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better than anybody could even imagine it. I would invite everybody who lives in Los Angeles to come down and check it out to see the future of L.A. and the commitment of Angelenos to caring for pets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja&rsquo;s four-legged pal, Ali, 10, is a shelter dog herself and is named for the famous boxer Muhammad Ali. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Ali the boxer, because she&rsquo;s so pretty,&rdquo; Jorja smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a dog in my life. I know this is a cliched thing to say, but she&rsquo;s my best friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja&rsquo;s love for animals affects her diet as well. &ldquo;I am a 20-year vegetarian,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I eat a lot of grains and vegetables and fruit and soy products. I eat a little bit of dairy, especially if I can find it organic and made in local, humane and free-range conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, she does admit to allowing herself &ldquo;some&rdquo; splurges. &ldquo;Chocolate, coffee, pizza. And beer. I could show you my six-pack, which is not like most actresses&rsquo; six-packs in this town!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calling herself a minimalist who doesn&rsquo;t like to collect too many things, Jorja does make an exception for jeans. &ldquo;I probably have 10 pairs of sneakers and nine pares of jeans. I like the old-school Levi&rsquo;s and Wrangler&rsquo;s that you might get an at army surplus store. I also wear a lot of Seven and True Religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja says in shape by running, hiking, camping and kayaking. She also finds herself surfing &ldquo;just for the fun of it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of goal oriented, and when I&rsquo;m surfing, I have no goals at all. I just like to enjoy myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 38-year-old star who once played rock music has put it on the back burner to focus on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. &ldquo;I get together with friends and play music from time to time, in the adult-alternative vein,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the time to actually be in a band. Someday, when &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is over and done, maybe I&rsquo;ll start a new bad. Mostly I play guitar; most people don&rsquo;t care for my singing. But I love to sing, so I do it a little bit,&rdquo; she smiles.</p>

<p>Jorja&rsquo;s other favorite side project is producing plays. On her next hiatus, she hopes to help her friend, actress Kirsten Holly Smith, continue her one-woman show, &ldquo;Blue-Eyed Soul: The Life and Times of Music Legend Dusty Springfield&rdquo;, the story of the famed &lsquo;60s soul singer.</p>

<p>But her focus this fall is on her show, as &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; faces a ratings challenge from the sexy doctors of &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been number one for longer than I ever thought it would be possible to hold that title,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been an amazing ride. I&rsquo;d love to stay there. I think that we&rsquo;ve all got our game faces on and we&rsquo;re going into the season very humble and very hungry. It&rsquo;s nice to have some competition. But I do hope we win!&rdquo;</p>

		<p><em>Translated from French</em></p>

<p><strong>The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What&rsquo;s going to happen in season seven?</strong></p>

<p>The producers keep it secret. It&rsquo;s impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven&rsquo;t though about killing Sara. She&rsquo;s had almost everything else happen to her &#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating &hellip; She&rsquo;s been the team&rsquo;s scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest. At last, I can finally smile on screen!</p>

<p><strong>After seven years are you used to seeing corpses?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m stronger now, but I sometimes want to puke when I see all the special effects made by our special effects! Outdoing other TV shows has become a game for them. They never run out of ideas to show amazing deaths.</p>

<p><strong>All this [death] doesn&rsquo;t seem to make for a cheerful atmosphere on the set!</strong></p>

<p>Not at all! We laugh and we play music. We made a band &#8212; the actors and the technicians. Marg Helgenberger plays piano, Gary Dourdan plays bass and Robert David Hall plays guitar. I even want to film one of our impromptu gigs for our fans!</p>

<p><strong>When you meet fans, what do you talk about ?</strong></p>

<p>All of them want to see Sara and Gil have a love story, which is going to happen in the new season. But &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about the private lives of its heroes. Mysteries are at the heart of every episode.</p>

<p><strong>Are you surprised by the infatuation of viewers about &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; ?</strong></p>

<p>What really surprised me is the interest our fans have in crimes. Some of them tell me complex scenarios about the best way to kill someone. At first, I was terrified about it and I felt like I had serial killers in front of me! Now I&rsquo;m more relaxed and I joke with them.</p>

<p><strong>We know very little about your private life. Why are you so secret ?</strong></p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to keep the mystery secret. And also it&rsquo;s good for the audience, so that people don&rsquo;t confuse me with my character on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>You never act in movies during your summer holiday. Is it a personal choice ?</strong></p>

<p>I work 14 hour days for nine and a half months and I don&rsquo;t want to run everywhere during my holidays. Seven years ago, I created my own theater troupe. That&rsquo;s how I relax.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a theater project going on?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a producer of &ldquo;Dear Bernard&rdquo;, a musical comedy about an English girl who comes to Hollywood to be successful. I also suggested to the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; producers that we write a musical episode for this season. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny to see Grissom and his team singing during autopsies? We could even pretend it was all Sara&rsquo;s dream!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if those procedural dramas, after spending years putting female crime victims through the wringer (and inside locked cages and under floorboards) have run out of ideas and moved on to harassing female crime fighters instead.</p>

<p>Yet it&rsquo;s also the case that many shows &#8212; facing softening ratings after many years on the air or tougher time-slot competition &#8212; are attempting to inject more personal story lines into a genre that once regarded them like germs in the crime lab. That was before &ldquo;Desperate Housewives,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; and other shows that feature almost nothing but personal story lines (especially female-centric ones) came along to captivate audiences.</p>

<p>Still, it can be a dicey business rejiggering the formula at this late date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the beginning of our fanship, there&rsquo;s sort of been a split,&rdquo; says &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; star Jorja Fox, whose show goes head-to-head with &ldquo;Anatomy&rdquo; on Thursdays at 9 p.m. and has lost the ratings race to the hospital drama three out of four weeks this season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been about 50 percent of the audience who would like to know more about the characters and about 50 percent who would really rather stick to the stories.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I beg forgiveness for all the mean things I&rsquo;ve said recently about TV Guide, becuase I nearly died when I saw your Jorja Fox/William Petersen cover [<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>]. He looks &ldquo;soooooo&rdquo; good. And Jorja&rsquo;s a doll, too! &#8212; &ldquo;Lauren Kleinfeldt, Glendale, N.Y.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>A million thanks for your gorgeous cover photo of Jorja Fox! I have followed &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; since Day 1, and I have watched Fox change form a pretty girl to a beautiful woman. Your cover is positive proof of that! &#8212; &ldquo;Maureen Holdridge, Plattsburgh, N.Y.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship. We got &lsquo;em!</strong></p>

<p>William Petersen &ldquo;and&rdquo; Jorja Fox &ldquo;tell all about CSI&rsquo;s biggest mystery yet&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Las Vegas. Sin City.</strong> The night was black as an oil patch left by a perp&rsquo;s getaway car, but the neon lights of the Strip cast a glow on the town tlike a rainbow on a bender. That&rsquo;s when we saw them &hellip; Grissom and Sidle, two CSIs who had no business being in a bedrobe together. The dame wore a robe, like she&rsquo;d just stepped out of the shower. And Grissom &hellip; her boss &hellip; lay on the bed, talking about death.</p>

<p>Turns out relationships that happen in Vegas don&rsquo;t always stay in Vegas. Here&rsquo;s the evidence: In the last scene of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;&rsquo;s May season finale, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) shocked viewers with their romantic rendezvous. Fan Web sites went nuts. TV GUIDE got lots of letters &#8212; some people liked the relationship; others wanted to send the storyline on a slow boat to China. We had to know: What were the producers thinking?</p>

<p>Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn came clean. This promises to be the most personal season of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; yet. Good thing, too, since it&rsquo;s now going up against TV&rsquo;s sudsiest smash, &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;. &ldquo;The bones of Season 7 will be the toll the job has on our CSIs,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The sin in Sin City is beginning to wear on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next we talked to exec producers Naren Shankar: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to turn into a soap opera, but we&rsquo;re going to see their anger with the world, and them reaching out to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they really sang like canaries: Turns out &ldquo;all&rdquo; the CSIs will get roughed up this season, in one way or another.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what we got. Now it&rsquo;s your turn. TV GUIDE sat down with Petersen and Fox to ask the &ldquo;your&rdquo; questions (collected on <a href="http://www.tvguide.com">tvguide.com</a>) about all that&rsquo;s happened and what&rsquo;s still to come on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Does the fan response to this new relationship shock you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>William Petersen:</strong> We knew there was a shock value to it because of the little bits and moments that Sara and Grissom have had over the years. So to see them together that way would have impact in terms of, &ldquo;Whoa, there they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I like the mystery of it. It left so many more questions than it really answered. And I think we&rsquo;re all going to figure that out as we go into this season. Billy and I aren&rsquo;t necessarily that far ahead of the audience with this one.</p>

<p><strong>How long have Grissom and Sara been seeing each other?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> We may find out more about that from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think Grissom so coldly said no to a relationship in earlier seasons but decided to accept it now?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Obviously, this relationship is fraught with danger for Grissom. He and Sara have a mentor-protegee relationship and it&rsquo;d be difficult for anyone in that situation. What one might say one day might not necessarily be how one feels. And what one ends up doing may not be what one thought he or she would be doing.</p>

<p><strong>Please, please, can we have a kiss before all is said and done?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> &ldquo;[Laughing]&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to think we could. We&rsquo;d love to kiss but the network would have to cough up some more money for that. Tongue would cost more. Sometimes they pay you for things that are fun.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Petersen, what were you thinking when you chose to wear that aloha shirt in the Season 6 finale? Did the thought of being shirtless ever cross your mind?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Regarding being shirtless, it never crossed my mind. That aloha shirt has a history. I got it in the Philippines 10 years ago off a guy&rsquo;s back. I traded him shirts in the jungle. For Grissom, it was something different. This is how he lets his hair down when he&rsquo;s with someone he trusts.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Sure, Sara loves Grissom in the buff. But I don&rsquo;t think that was what the scene was about. One of my favorite things was Grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters. And maybe they go home after the things they&rsquo;ve seen and have some tenderness of their own.</p>

<p><strong>Which character will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s hidden romance?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Sara and Grissom are not going to let people find out, which makes it even more intense. I don&rsquo;t know who would find out first or how they&rsquo;d react. I do know there are several actors dying to be the one who finds out. &ldquo;[Laughs]&rdquo; Paul Guilfoyle has already gone to the writers saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The chemistry between the entire group seems to be changing &hellip; the bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why?</strong><br />
<strong>Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry the writer feels that way. The writer will be happy to find out there&rsquo;s some Warrick and Nick stuff coming up early in this season.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, you play Sara so well, I wonder if you are like her?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I am probably more like her than any other character I&rsquo;ve played, which is lucky considering that this has been going on for six years. Billy swears that he&rsquo;s acting like Grissom, and that must be exhausting for you &ldquo;[Petersen laughs]&ldquo;. I do like her a lot. She&rsquo;s much smarter than I am. But I also like to focus on one thing for a while. We have OCD in common. I&rsquo;m very idealistic, like Sara.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Lady Heather is Grissom&rsquo;s soul mate?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> I think she&rsquo;s his spanking partner. Every now and then a guy needs a good spanking. Lady Heather could teach this country a lot. How to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Definitely how to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It would be great if Lady Heather and Sara met. It would be a fun scene to do. When we go places that are sensual, sexual or a bit exotic or scandalous, Sara&rsquo;s never there. She&rsquo;s at the car-wash murder across town &ldquo;[laughs]&ldquo;. So it is a pet peeve of mine that these episodes get written and I&rsquo;m miles away. And I wonder if that&rsquo;s partially control on Grissom&rsquo;s part, since he hands out the cases.</p>

<p><strong>Now that you&rsquo;ll be going up against &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;, will you be adding more story lines about the personal relationships on the show to attract some of the &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; fans?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I wish them well. It&rsquo;s a great show and a lot of wonderful people are involved.</p>
