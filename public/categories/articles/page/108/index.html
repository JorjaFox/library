		<p>Every young actress with ambition hopes to make it in movies. But if it doesn&rsquo;t work out the way you wanted, television can be a great alternative for a successful career. A great example of this is Jorja Fox (38).</p>

<p>She has appeared on the hit series [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] for six years. Previous, she appeared on two other hit series: [[ER]] and [[The West Wing]].</p>

<p>Anyone who tries to remember her movies, probably comes up with [[Memento]]. In that movie, she played the wife of the main character, played by Guy Pearce, who, short after the death of his wife, loses his memory. Practically speaking, there were just a few short scenes with Jorja in it, so there was not so much acting involved. So Jorja concentrated on television.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox, born on 7 July 1968 in New York, daughter of Canadian immigrants, spent her childhood in Florida. When she was 15, she won a modeling contest, which really amazed her because she was the only brunette in the contest. After winning the contest she moved to New York. After three years of modeling in America and Europe she stopped, she wanted to be an actress.</p>

<p>She attended the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York and started a long road of small roles in TV series and films for seven years. In 1996 she got her first big role as the no-nonsense Dr. [[Maggie Doyle]] in the hit series ER. The role of the vegetarian lesbian doctor fit Jorja perfectly, because she is both herself. She appeared in 33 episodes of ER and after that she tried movies again. She appeared in three movies, the last of which being Memento. In 2000 she played an agent of the Secret Service, protecting the daughter of the president, in the West wing.</p>

<p>Right now Jorja plays [[Sara Sidle]] in CSI, which recently celebrated their 150st episode. There was a little problem in 2004 when she refused to sign her contract for the new season. But soon she realized that she didn&rsquo;t want to quit playing this great role on this hit series.</p>

<p>Ellen DeGeneres focused on the word itself, telling Extra: &ldquo;This particular word is thrown around all the time at the workplace, at the playground, on the sports field and no one gets outraged. Hopefully this incident will put an end to this and people will stop using this word and other hateful words once and for all.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s hope the insanity stops here, and that Jorja Fox isn&rsquo;t forced to drop by Ellen to tearfully recount the time Gil Grissom called her a &ldquo;greedy rugmuncher&rdquo; upon discovering she ate the last craft service banana.</p>

<p>Speaking of torches, what about the one Grissom carries for Sara? According to Mendelsohn, his departure will cause tension in that relationship, the source of which will become clear in a future episode &#8212; when Grissom will try to make things right by &ldquo;sending Sara (Jorja Fox) something. Fans may remember the last time he did that, it was a plant. So for longtime fans, this will have resonance.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Number one all around the world, CSI is apparently still at the top of its game. One could be forgiven for thinking that after seven seasons and two spin-offs, the genre would have completely lost steam, but that&rsquo;s not taking into account the talent of the writers and the quality of the actors. We went to talk to the team behind the show to find out what they have in store for us in Season seven and how the show has managed to remain as fresh as ever.</p>

<p>A few months ago at the CBS Season seven premiere we were able to meet the CSI team : Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), Gary Dourdan (Warrick), George Eads (Nick), Jorja Fox (Sara), Eric Szmanda (Greg), Robert David Hall (Dr Al Robbins), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Brass), Carol Mendelsohn (Executive Producer) and Naren Shankar (Executive Producer).</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been for a very long time hints of some history or special chemistry between Grissom and Sara&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JORJA FOX:</strong> Not in the pilot because I wasn&rsquo;t there from the very first episode. Yeah, the character of Sara Sidle was described, in the very brief description given out before the auditions, as Grissom&rsquo;s eventual love interest. There were also a few other strange bits of information, like the fact that she could hold alcohol better than anyone and some mention of sociability problems. I was very intrigued by that and prepared myself for the day the relationship would become reality. Lots of little hints dropped here and there through the series have led up to it. The coolest part if the way the affair is revealed at the end of the season. It was ingenious of the writers, because we see the characters together, but we don&rsquo;t know how long they&rsquo;ve been together. It was brilliantly executed. It&rsquo;s going to open up lots of ideas for the characters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what state of mind were you before playing the scene between your character and Grissom?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JORJA FOX:</strong> I was very enthusiastic. It&rsquo;s also quite frightening because there is a certain comfort in doing a procedural. One of the most beautiful gifts of this show is that at the end of seven years, there are still as many personal stories to tell about each one. It&rsquo;s rare, after so long, to continue to want to know more about the characters. It&rsquo;s very motivating.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you expect the impassioned reactions of the audience to the relevance of this scene?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>NAREN SHANKAR:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if it was a surprise but it was gratifying. When people have such strong feelings, it&rsquo;s a measure of their interest in the show, so it was really very pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>CAROL MENDELSOHN:</strong> When I came back to work on the new season, I found on my desk a huge pile of letters from fans all around the world. I was told that the viewers were divided, that 60% approved of Sara and Grissom being together and 40% did not. The fans were delighted to see two adults, two professionals who were excellent in their work, find each other and engage in a serious and romantic relationship that isn&rsquo;t sordid&hellip; You don&rsquo;t see them tearing at each other&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA FOX:</strong> No, that&rsquo;s for next year! (Laughs) Thats why Billy and I have been working out at the gym all summer! (Laughs)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re on that topic, are there other characters who are together without anyone knowing about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JORJA FOX:</strong> No, for the moment, at the start of Season seven it&rsquo;s only Grissom and Sara, as our delightful (beautiful) audience knows well. One of the most amusing things about doing a series for such a long time, is that new stories that you haven&rsquo;t ever thought of, crop up. Gary never thought he&rsquo;d be married, nor did George think he&rsquo;d spend 48 hours in a box. The writers and producers are very generous. If there is something that we don&rsquo;t want to do or that bothers us, generally, they&rsquo;ll change it. They also invite ideas from us which will really be included in the show. That&rsquo;s cool. We never know how things will go in the years to come, and that&rsquo;s the fun part.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox takes time off from playing CSI&rsquo;s forensics investigator Sara Sidle to show us around the set of the hit TV Show</strong></p>

<p>###The crime lab###</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have one of the best equipped labs in the US, even though it&rsquo;s only TV. A lot of the equipment is given to us by the companies that make it, and there&rsquo;s a technical expert with us every day. I could probably use the equipment to fingerprint and identify body fluids, but most other things vanish from my brain as soon as I do them. I&rsquo;ve never been told what Sara&rsquo;s specialism is. We only found out a lot of the background to each of our characters when a website was created with character profiles on it halfway through the first series. I found out then that Sara studied nuclear fusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>###Grissom&rsquo;s office###</p>

<p>&ldquo;The office beautifully reflects the character of William Petersen&rsquo;s CSI chief Gil Grissom. There are a few little in-jokes, like someone has the producer Jerry Bruckheimer&rsquo;s business card in a drawer, and there used to be a Billy Bass singing fish over the door, but that had to go because everyone kept setting it off. There&rsquo;s usually a crossword puzzle on the desk, so there are lots of scene where people come in and Grissom&rsquo;s doing a crossword. I try to block out the things in the jars on the shelves like the in vitro pig. When we started off there were some real crime scene photos on the walls, but I think those have been replaced by our own cases. One of the joys of this series is working closely with William again. Most of my scenes were with him for the first three series, but then Sara stopped chasing him, so I&rsquo;ve missed working with him so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>###The autopsy room###</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we started off the show we were liming in a disused morgue, but they decided we had to have a set when a real body got dropped off by mistake. Now we have something that&rsquo;s more state-of-the-art that most real autopsy rooms. I love doing scenes in there, but I do have days where I have to skip lunch because the special effects are so good and getting grosser. There was one story with some mangled legs and I thought I was going to pass out. Nothing is real, not even the skeleton. It&rsquo;s not the gore that gets to me, it&rsquo;s the idea of how these people died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>###What&rsquo;s in store for the new series?###</p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has always had its share of shocking storylines, but perhaps none has taken viewers&rsquo; breath away quite as much as the final scene of the last series in which CSI chief Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and his colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) were revealed to be having an affair.</p>

<p>The storyline incurred the wrath of the many fans who believed it would be fellow investigator Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) who would win Gil&rsquo;s heart yet, when the show returns this week, Grissom and Sara will still be together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a secret to everyone but the audience,&rdquo; says &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;&rsquo;s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not just going to be the Grissom and Sara show from now on. The bones of this series will be the toll the job has had on the investigators.&rdquo;</p>
