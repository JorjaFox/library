<p><strong>CSI Files:</strong> It brought back memories from Season Four, when Sara started popping cough drops to mask her issues with alcohol and ultimately facing a DUI. If anyone is going to stop [Nick] from loosing focus, it&rdquo;s her; and she did. Will they talk about this issue in subsequent episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: Yes. There was purpose to the fact that they&rdquo;re in different places in their lives and yet it was very poignant for Sara and Nick to get into it. She does want to help him&ndash;there&rdquo;s the emotionalÂ push-backÂ of him quitting at the worst possible time; there&rdquo;s never a good timeÂ *to*Â do these things, there&rdquo;s always emotions so it&rdquo;s messy. They can help each other, but like Nick said he&rdquo;s not in a position to be lectured to, but that isn&rdquo;t what she was trying to do. There was a little bit of miscommunication and they will try to help each other out. Sara has gained perspective so she understands where Nick is coming from and Nick is not at a point where he can easily hear that at this moment, at least in the premiere.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Moving forward in the season, how will the dynamic of Nick, Sara and Greg Â shift? Is this a season of conflict for the three of them?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: I think it&rdquo;s probably more a season of maturity for Greg. An episode coming up will focus in on him and his further maturing at CSI and his personal life. I don&rdquo;t think there&rdquo;ll be conflict with them, but certainly things are changing in their lives. Things can never stay the same; you get comfortable with a certain situation, and you expect certain things and sometimes things change for good and sometimes they change for bad. I don&rdquo;t know that they&rdquo;re going to fight more, but certainly they are going to have to readjust their own expectations of what the job presents to them and how they can help each other.</p>

<p>***CSI: Crime Scene Investigation<br />
***CBS, Wednesdays, 10 ET/PT<br />
Premiere: Sept. 26</p>

<p><strong>Where we left them:</strong> Under attack from the former undersheriff of Las Vegas, the murderous Jeffrey McKeen (Conor O&rsquo;Farrell) &#8212; who runs an underworld empire of drugs and corrupt cops from his prison cell &#8212; the CSI team was on the ropes, with Undersheriff Ecklie (Marc Vann) gunned down on the street, investigator Nick Stokes (George Eads) handing in his resignation in frustration, and supervisor D.B. Russell&rsquo;s (Ted Danson) young granddaughter kidnapped.</p>

<p><strong>Where they&rsquo;re headed:</strong> The Season 13(!) premiere picks up the moment the cliffhanger ended, with even more team members in danger &#8212; including the newest, Julie Finlay (Elisabeth Shue), who takes off after the kidnapped Kaitlyn and shares a secret-filled past with Russell. The &ldquo;<em>Cape-Fear</em>-ish&rdquo; storyline, says executive producer Don McGill, was designed to take the ever-serene D.B. and see &ldquo;what would happen if we took that guy who seemed to have everything in control, his family and work, and really pushed him to the edge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That push will carry through the season. &ldquo;We show his worst fears, that his granddaughter is dead, and we see his demons and his darker side, his impulse to go an eye for an eye,&rdquo; McGill says. &ldquo;As we lean forward into the season, we&rsquo;ll see that worst fear play out. Once something happens to a family &#8212; even if the resolution seems neat and tidy &#8212; the emotional fallout is anything but.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll also explore the relationship between him and Shue&rsquo;s Finn. &ldquo;They have a long history,&rdquo; albeit a mostly professional one, McGill says. While D.B. is committed to his family, &ldquo;for Finley, who struggles to have relationships with men, Russell is kind of the perfect man &#8212; but unattainable, which is part of the attraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Who&rsquo;s new or returning:</strong> McGill says they&rsquo;ll focus on the core cast this season &#8212; including, finally, answering the perplexing question: What&rsquo;s up with Sara (Jorja Fox) and Grissom (the long-departed William Petersen)? He&rsquo;s been in the jungle for years, but she&rsquo;s still on the case &#8212; are they even married anymore? &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll answer that, in a way that may surprise people.&rdquo; McGill says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll deal with her dissatisfaction with the long-distance relationship, and may find a resolution as to where the marriage is headed.&rdquo; The season also will explore the relationship of Ecklie to his estranged CSI daughter Morgan (Elisabeth Harnois) &#8212; and his romance with Hodges&rsquo; mom Olivia (guest Jaclyn Smith). <strong><em>&#8212; Bruce Schwartz</em></strong></p>

		<p><em>Translated from Spanish.</em></p>

<p>CSI: Las Vegas returns to Telecinco and does so with what is already its eleventh season.</p>

<p>Chain broadcast every Thursday from 22:00 two new episodes of the long-running fiction starring Marg Helgenberger, Laurence Fishburne, George Eads, Eric Szmanda and Robert David Hall, Jorja Fox. Recently, Jorja spoke about the premiere of new episodes and one of the major complaints: the lack of Gil Grissom. William Petersen will briefly return to the show via Skype and talk to his wife and mother.</p>

<p><strong>In the episode &ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissom&rdquo; Sara Sidle uses sign language. Was it challenging for you?</strong></p>

<p>At first, I panicked. I thought I would have to learn sign language for a scene and suddenly became half of the episode. The writers of &#8216;CSI&rsquo; give the best of themselves and go for broke.</p>

<p><strong>Did you enjoy learning sign language?</strong></p>

<p>It was fun and ended up buying several videos of sign language. I have not yet had time to get to them, but I want to do in the offseason. It is a language that makes sense to me.</p>

<p><strong>How has having William Petersen back in the series?</strong></p>

<p>It was incredibly exciting and we did what we could to keep everything with the utmost secrecy. William decided he wanted to surprise the audience. If by chance you were watching the show, saw it, otherwise they would have to find him. It was an impossible task for us.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Sara Sidle and Gil Grissom used Skype to communicate?</strong></p>

<p>There was an episode where Grissom Sara sent a video message by email, essentially to break with him from Shepard sea, off the coast of Galapagos Islands. We believed that this was the appropriate way Grissom and Sara had to report regularly. After that, he was in a jungle in Costa Rica, which is great.</p>

<p><strong>Was it fun doing the episode &ldquo;House of Hoarders&rdquo;?</strong></p>

<p>George Eads had been talking about the idea of hoarders for two years, so it was very exciting to see the script when it came to light. The writers ran with it and became something bigger than George had imagined. I was very happy to oblige.</p>

<p><strong>What effect did the episode &ldquo;House of Hoarders&rdquo; in the cast?</strong></p>

<p>I think George went home and ran saying it was a whole ciberacaparador. In my house, I&rsquo;m very minimalist, but when I looked at my computer, my mails and texts that I save, I thought &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hogging, only instead of at home on my computer&rdquo;. If I could download everything I have on the computer, it may fill six houses.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the episode &ldquo;Fracked&rdquo; so important for everyone?</strong></p>

<p>Humans are sharing increasingly smaller amounts of space and we have to invade areas who had been in the wild.&rsquo;re being forced to pull resources from places that should have remained untouched forever. There is a long list of issues that are reaching critical mass. Hopefully everyone will enjoy it because I think all , almost anywhere, can take it to a personal level.</p>

<p><strong>How has the character of Lady Heather developed in the eleventh season?</strong></p>

<p>Her character has had the opportunity to be involved in many mysteries. offers a different side of herself in this episode that fans have not seen before and they will decide whether the new Lady Heather is authentic or not. has been very chameleon. has been able to do different things to different people.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a favorite episode of season 11?</strong></p>

<p>One of them is undoubtedly &ldquo;House of Hoarders&rdquo;. It was very deep, felt like I was going through a maze and suddenly I found myself in the middle and have to work to find the way back home. &ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissom&rdquo; was great too, was something that normally is not usually done.</p>

<p><strong>What you have told the followers of the series on the eleventh season?</strong></p>

<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve heard about Grissom&rsquo;s return. It was incredible to see him again this season. The fans thanked him again and I hope this little glimpse have thought about how wonderful his life outside of Las Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Would you still like to play Sara Sidle?</strong></p>

<p>I still have not spent a single minute playing Sara boring. Your life is fascinating and interesting. Changes and dangerous, but somehow always has a way out of the difficulties. If you keep calling me to play Sara, I will come.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;s&rsquo; season finale proved that even though the procedural drama has been on the air for 12 seasons, it&rdquo;s still got what it takes to surprise viewers. The kidnapping of D.B. Russell&rdquo;s (&ldquo;&lsquo;Ted Danson&rdquo;&rsquo;) granddaughter Kaitlyn (&ldquo;&lsquo;Mia Hayes&rdquo;&rsquo;) and the resignation of Nick Stokes (&ldquo;&lsquo;George Eads&rdquo;&rsquo;) set such dramatic â and unforeseen â events in motion that the audience will be compelled to tune in for 13th season premiere to get answers.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Will Sara Sidle [Jorja Fox] be more in the forefront this year?</strong> Since Fox returned to the series on a fulltime basis last season â after four seasons as a guest star, she hasn&rdquo;t had a front burner storyline. Part of the reasons is time had to be spent to introduce the new characters of DB Russell and Julie Finlay [Elisabeth Shue]. But that is about to change.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sara will very much be in the forefront in the premiere and she is very much in the forefront in episode 2,&rsquo; Mendelsohn says. &lsquo;There will be a murder at the cop diner, where the cops and the CSIs all go to eat. Actually more than one murder. It is going to hit home and hit a friend of hers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Also in terms of Sara, we may delve into the Sara/Grissom [William Petersen] long-distance relationship. We are always hopeful that Billy may come back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>[Ed. Note: Petersen was supposed to have made his return to TV this year with a Cinemax series, &ldquo;Hurt People,&rdquo; but the latest word is he has pulled out of that, so he may be available.]</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rsquo; premieres its 13th season on Wednesday, Sept. 26 at 10/9c on CBS.</strong></p>

		<p>It was a pleasure sitting down with Jorja Fox on a park bench on a quiet Wall Street in Kingston on Labor Day to interview her about the new documentary she produced called &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant.&rdquo; The documentary was one of the films screened in the first Kingston NY Film Festival.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox is a vegetarian so I wanted to know where she dined. Which Hudson Valley restaurants offer good vegetarian cuisine? Does she visit the Hudson Valley often?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! A gazillion places to eat which is so nice while you&rdquo;re on vacation. I never had a car when I lived in NYC so this area is mostly a mystery to me. I came to the first Woodstock reunion, back in the 1990s so I knew I was in the general area, but I couldn&rdquo;t tell you exactly where I was (laughs) I just got on the bus at Port Authority. Because of Astrid, we had a mutual friend in California, who invited me to come. For very strict vegetarian there is the Garden CafÃ© in Woodstock which is amazing,&rdquo; says Jorja Fox.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox enjoyed eating at two Kingston restaurants. &ldquo;At Boitson&rsquo;s, I had these incredible vegan fried mushrooms, like oyster mushrooms, almost taste like calamari, and we also enjoyed DUO Bistro very much,&rdquo; adds Fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I Became an Elephant&rdquo; tells the real sad and disturbing tale about the behind the scene story that most circus-goers and Thailand elephant trekking tourists don&rsquo;t know. Elephants are my favorite animals, and I knew about illegal poaching, but I had no idea about the torture these poor mammals go through at the hands of the mamouts-elephant trainers. Baby elephants are ripped away from their moms and &ldquo;broken&rdquo; and repeatedly hit with and beaten in order to perform tricks for the tourist dollar. Many of the scenes of the abuse are hard to watch. (In fact, the young woman sitting next to me sobbed for half the movie!) I don&rsquo;t think I could ever go to a circus after seeing this movie now. Instead I would like to one day visit an elephant sanctuary in the US. Fox mentioned that there are only two right now, one in Tennesse and one in California. I will put those on my bucket list.</p>

<p>As a kid, Jorja Fox watched National Geographic every week with her progressive, environmentalist and wild life lover grandmother, never missing a show. When Jorja Fox met filmmaker Tim Gorski at a small dinner party in LA, they started talking about his work in Thailand with illegal wildlife trafficking, and she found a way to get invested with one of her passions, and later became the producer for &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant&rdquo; which stars a 15-year old animal activist Juliette West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I adore elephants for so many different reasons-their gentleness, intelligence. They are vegetarians. Like all of the really large land mammals, their habitats are in some of the most peril. They are a great subject because what&rdquo;s going on with them is so criticial, so immediate. Elephants just have a grace and dignity to them,&rdquo; says Fox.</p>

<p>Fox said she had a lovely weekend in the Kingston/Woodstock area and was very excited to be part of the Kingston Film Festival, especially since it was the first screening of the film in her home state of NY, and also because she got to hang out with family while she was here.</p>

<p>Although the documentary will appeal to animal lovers of all ages, Jorja Fox and Tim Gorski agree that their target demographic is junior high school to college age viewers since the movie&rsquo;s lead is 15-year old Juliette West. Besides a couple of distribution deals on the horizon, they also plan a Netflix release, and hope to have screenings at high schools and colleges. If you are interested in viewing or screening &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant&rdquo; contact them throught the movie&rsquo;s website.</p>
