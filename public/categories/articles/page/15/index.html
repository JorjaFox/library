<p><strong>I&rsquo;m crushed that the *CSI *writers broke up Sara and Grissom! What are they thinking?</strong></p>

<p><em>Lisa</em></p>

<p><strong>ADAM:</strong> Hopefully, this news will console you. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s <em>over</em>,&rdquo; executive producer Don McGill tells us. &ldquo;We felt the relationship had hit the true rocks and things were really at a breaking point. But they&rsquo;re not divorced or even separated. They&rsquo;re really just taking a very big time out.&rdquo; More good news: The writers aren&rsquo;t planning to throw Sara into any rebound flings and are actually hoping that this relationship hiccup might lure Grissom himself, William Petersen, back to the show. &ldquo;The door is always open,&rdquo; McGill says. Silver lining?</p>

		<p><em>CSI</em> returns to UK screens early next week - Channel 5 will begin airing season 13, which kicks off with thrill-packed premiere &#8216;Karma to Burn&rsquo;, this coming Tuesday. After the events of the season 12 finale, the <em>CSI</em> team find themselves in crisis, but must overcome the odds to rescue Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter and bring the kidnappers to justice.</p>

<p>To mark the show&rsquo;s triumphant return, <strong>Digital Spy</strong> spoke with <em>CSI</em> star <strong>Jorja Fox</strong> - who plays Sara Sidle - to get all the scoop on the new season, the show&rsquo;s future and the possibility of a Sara / Grissom reunion&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The last season of <em>CSI</em> ended with Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter in deep trouble. Where does season 13 pick up?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty much everything that could go wrong has gone wrong - Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter has been kidnapped, Ecklie (Marc Vann) is shot and in dire jeopardy - you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to make it or not</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finn (Elisabeth Shue) has disappeared off the Earth and Nick Stokes (George Eads) has quit, so pandemonium has ensued and the characters definitely spend the first half of the [season 13 premiere] running around, fearing the worst. So it&rsquo;s a suspenseful episode, for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Season 12 saw Ted Danson join the show as Russell, as well as Elisabeth Shue replacing Marg Helgenberger - has this new season felt more stable?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, actually - and a third character, Elisabeth Harnois [who plays Morgan Brody] joined two episodes before the end of season 11, so essentially her and Ted started right around the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have three new characters in such a short period of time, it almost feels like we&rsquo;re doing a completely new show, but with all the perks of having done a show for such a long time - the people that you trust, the short-hand and the collaboration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s been an amazing season - season 12 and season 13 so far have been some of the most fun seasons I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of - and yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right to use the world &#8216;stable&rsquo;. I would say &#8216;stable&rsquo; maybe for the first time!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even before cast members began departing, there was always something exciting that would shake up the show at least once a year so, knock on wood, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying that feeling [of stability].</p>

<p>&ldquo;Season 13 is pretty much the first season of the show for many years where the writers knew what cast they would have to write for - pretty much every year they would end and they wouldn&rsquo;t know who was coming back [the following season], so it was very difficult for them to start early on stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The second episode of this season is a big one for Sara, isn&rsquo;t it?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the biggest departure for the show this season - we&rsquo;re doing something we&rsquo;ve never done before, in that virtually every episode so far has had a very profound personal storyline for at least one character on the show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve tended to avoid often in the past - we&rsquo;d maybe do this kind of stuff every ten episodes, or once a season - but we&rsquo;re getting to the core and the heart of the matter with season 13, so I hope everybody enjoys it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Episode seven &#8216;Fallen Angels&rsquo; also contains nods to the past and to the character of Warrick Brown - what can you reveal about that?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a tough one to shoot, because I miss Gary Dourdan every day. It&rsquo;s funny - he&rsquo;s been gone for a long time and I still miss him on the show. I miss his character, I miss his energy - so it was hard to go back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, in the make-believe world of <em>CSI</em>, you&rsquo;re also going back into the life of one of your best friends who&rsquo;s passed away and we find out that things are not going so well [for his family], so I think it is a really awesome episode. Meta Golding, who plays Warrick&rsquo;s wife on the show, is brilliant. But it was hard - it was one of those ones that was heartbreaking to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s also going to be a crossover between <em>CSI</em> and <em>CSI: NY</em> - what role does Sara play in that?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gary Sinise&rsquo;s character from <em>CSI: NY</em> - because he&rsquo;s in our show, he&rsquo;s having a profound personal problem. He crossed over into Las Vegas and now he&rsquo;s in the land of personal nightmares and demons!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he arrives in Las Vegas and this [case] is something that Russell is helping with very closely. My character in the <em>CSI</em> part of the crossover is off on a different crime with Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) that involves grifting - which is always really fascinating in Las Vegas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>There have been rumors that we might finally meet Sara&rsquo;s mother - do you know if that is happening?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;s been a rumor since season two! I can&rsquo;t confirm or deny it, but I would love to meet her too. She&rsquo;s a scary person! I can&rsquo;t confirm it, but that sounds great, so I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a dream actress in mind for the role?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a really, really long list, but I&rsquo;d have to say Mary Tyler Moore - I just love her so much, I&rsquo;d love the chance to see her on the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Are there any plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to make another appearance following his cameo in season eleven?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that there is some stuff [planned] - I&rsquo;m always hoping for it. I feel like Sara&rsquo;s a little young to sleep alone every night and she&rsquo;s still very much in love with Grissom, so we&rsquo;re always thinking about and hoping for some type of reunion between the two of them - at least I am. That will be a story for Sara in season 13 - what it&rsquo;s like to have a long-distance relationship and how she&rsquo;s weathering all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Last year, <em>CSI</em> was named the most watched show in the world for the fifth time. How does it feel knowing that the show remains a global phenomenon 13 seasons in?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astounding - it&rsquo;s one of the highest fan compliments the show could ever receive. We were floating on air about it for several weeks and it&rsquo;s always a surprise. It means so much that it&rsquo;s international, that it&rsquo;s global - we&rsquo;re tucked away in California doing the show, and I think we all want to be out in the world more than we are. To find out that there&rsquo;s folks out all over who are watching is an amazing feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>*<strong>CSI: Miami* sadly ended last year, but do you think there is still plenty of life left in the original <em>CSI</em>?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, for sure. Again, we&rsquo;ve been so lucky - I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s bored yet. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve had the same job this long - as an actor, I didn&rsquo;t even know that was possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that I continue to be excited to go to work every day and I absolutely adore the people I&rsquo;m working with and unfortunately in the United States there&rsquo;s no shortage of crimes to tell stories about! So yeah, I&rsquo;d like to see us go for a couple more years, I think we got it in us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached a place with the show where we pretty much get picked up for one season at a time and that&rsquo;s okay - it&rsquo;s always been a pleasant surprise to find out that we were going to go another year. I think that we&rsquo;re certainly one of the grandparents of TV right now in the States - if we were a person, we&rsquo;d have our little cane and hearing aid and that&rsquo;s a very nice place to be in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darn it&rsquo;s hard to be a TV fan these days, no? It seems like showrunners are just out to toy with our emotions and &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; was a perfect example tonight as a longstanding fan favorite couple took a (seemingly) one-way trip to splitsville. These are dark days, our friends!</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Couples Watch:</strong> In sad, sad TV couples news, <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s Sara (<strong>Jorja Fox</strong>) and Grissom (<strong>William Petersen</strong>) are splitting up. After 13 years. We repeat: <em>13 years</em>, which is basically 100 years when it comes to TV relationships. Let&rsquo;s mourn together in the comments, shall we? We&rsquo;ll bring the chocolate, you bring the tissues.</p>

		<p>There has always been a great divide amongst the fans of <strong>CSI</strong>, between those who love Grissom and Sara together and those who, I don’t know, hate romance and kick puppies for fun. Up until last night, the fans of GSR had pretty much won most of the battles in this cold war, but with “Forget Me Not,” this week’s episode, the other side landed a major, heart-breaking victory when Sara revealed that she and Grissom have separated.</p>

<p>How did this happen? Well, in true* CSI *fashion, the writers didn’t seem at all interested in explaining their reasons for this twist. It’s apparently enough for them just to imply that it was Grissom’s choice and that he might have been doing it for what he considers to be Sara’s benefit. Anyone who knows the history between them, though, knows that Grissom has not always been the best judge of his own needs and wants, much less Sara’s. It’s going to be very easy for the anti-Sara crowd to point their fingers and blame her for the breakup, and the writers made it very easy for them by having her immediately fool around with another man, but the real question is why did this incredibly strong woman, who never gave up on her love for an impossible man, give up on her marriage?</p>

<p>I don’t believe she has. She’s still wearing her wedding ring, she is still calling him her husband, she hasn’t removed any of their photos from their ridiculously gorgeous house, and she couldn’t bring herself to tell anyone that it had actually happened until she absolutely couldn’t avoid it. If she’s still hopeful, I’m still hopeful, no matter what the writers might have been trying to tell half of their audience through the supposedly-wise wisdom of Nick in the final scene with him and Sara and Greg. (That is not a diss on Nick; I thought he was great in the rest of the episode, defending not only Sara’s life, but her privacy.) “If it’s over, it’s over”? The only “over” I will accept is if Grissom and Sara are still separated at the series finale. And even then there’s always fan fiction.</p>

<p>Moving on, the case itself was compelling by the very nature of what being framed for murder put Sara through. The humiliation of having her private life become hallway gossip, the mortification of being booked and processed…she bore all of it, confident that her teammates would prove her innocence. She even pinpointed the real murderer, the crazy stalker from a few months back who blamed Sara for the death of his stalkee, and wanted to make her pay for keeping them apart. It was an insanely emotional week for Sara.</p>

<p>So, what better time to introduce her mother? Um…how about in any other episode where there might have been a touch more time to actually utilize such a long-awaited, highly anticipated, much-speculated character? We’ve all been wondering about Laura Sidle since the day we saw Sara researching her court case back in season five. That was almost eight years ago. Why the sudden rush to cram her into this particular episode? Sara was already on to her stalker, so just knowing that he’d contacted her mother only gave her slightly more resolve to take him down. In other words, what did having Laura in this episode really do? Are we going to see her again soon? Are we going to see a woman who stabbed her husband seven times try to give her daughter advice about her own marriage? I kind of hope not. If anything, maybe she could just be a shoulder for Sara to lean on.</p>

<p>Truthfully, though, Sara already has two really good (and nicely muscled) pairs of shoulders in Nick and Greg, her long-time teammates and friends. I can’t say much for this episode, but I will say that in this particular area, they got it right. The three of them are the last of the original cast (since apparently Brass has vanished) and it was really great to see the boys have Sara’s back through thick and thin. That is why, even though the GSR community is devastated, we are not defeated. Some of us may jump ship, and we will mourn them, but the rest of us will strap ourselves to the mast and ride out the storm on the faith that there will be calmer waters ahead. And that’s as far as I can take the shipping metaphor.</p>

		<p>Why so sad, Sara?</p>

<p>In Wednesdays episode of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; on CBS, Sara (Jorja Fox) will deal with her long-distance marriage with Gil (William Petersen) in an episode titled &ldquo;Forget Me Not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The implication is that they have been having a sort of beautiful  if not stuck  romantic, long-distance marriage,&rdquo; Fox tells EW exclusively. &ldquo;Hes been on the move, leading his nomadic life. But there comes a time when you cant leave a pivotal story suspended forever. All these characters around her are enjoying flirtations and romances. Sara is too young to sleep alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does that mean she doesnt want Gil anymore? Fox is predictably coy, though she admits there are still plenty of fans out there who want Petersen, who was last seen on the show via a Skype conversation in 2011, to return. &ldquo;When I go out in the world, people continue to ask when Grissom is coming back. Its extraordinary,&rdquo; she tells EW. &ldquo;You never really know, which is true. We labored so intensely over the Sara and Grissom arc from seasons 3 to 8 and we never really imagined there would be a season 13. And here we are with the opportunity to open a new chapter that we never thought we were going to get. Along with the darkness and violence, somewhere there is love and peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But will that be the case for Sara? See for yourself.</p>
