		<p>No stranger to television, Fox also starred on NBC&rsquo;s top-rated series &ldquo;ER&rdquo; as resident intern Dr. Maggie Doyle prior to her segue as Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano on Aaron Sokin&rsquo;s Emmy Award-winning drama, &ldquo;The West Wing.&rdquo; Additional credits include guest turns on &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; and the historic coming out episode of &ldquo;Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox has also managed to carve out some impressive film credits that includes this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival dramatic competitor &ldquo;Memento.&rdquo; This marks Fox&rsquo;s third foray into Sundance. She has previously made the trip in conjunction with her roles as sister to Clean Duvall in the quirky comedy &ldquo;How To Make The Cruelest Month&rdquo; and as the town gossip in &ldquo;The Kill-Off&rdquo; which was based on the book by renowned author Jim Thompson (&ldquo;The Grifters&rdquo;): More recent feature credits include the comedy &ldquo;Forever Fabulous&rdquo; with Jean Smart and &#8216;Down With The Joneses&rsquo; opposite Joshua Leonard (&ldquo;The Blair Witch Project&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Having appeared in numerous stage productions, this New York born actress continues to work tirelessly in conjunction with the theater company which she co-founded, Honeypot Productions.</p>

<p>The following is an up-close and personal interview.</p>

<p><strong>Chaunc&eacute; Hayden: You&rsquo;ve starred on &ldquo;ER,&rdquo; &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; and now &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; All three have been huge hits. Are you just lucky or is your agent a genius?</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox: (Laughs) Yeah, it&rsquo;s been crazy. With &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; the difference is that they were already humongus hits when I got the job to be on them. But &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is a nice surprise. I mean when the first show airs you just hope that all your friends will watch it.</p>

<p><strong>There are so many bad shows today. I mean some are really horrible. Don&rsquo;t you agree?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah. The same thing is going on with movies. I think films have a really short window to be successful. There&rsquo;s just so much to chose from it seems.</p>

<p><strong>The critics say the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; pushes the boundaries of what we&rsquo;re used to seeing on network television.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true. I also think what makes &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; a hit is that it&rsquo;s a story that hasn&rsquo;t been told that much. So hopefully it&rsquo;s a little different.</p>

<p><strong>For people that haven&rsquo;t seen &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; how would you describe the premise?</strong></p>

<p>The premise is that we&rsquo;re the people that come in to a crime scene who aren&rsquo;t cops. We&rsquo;re scientists&rsquo;. And when something happens and there&rsquo;s pieces of the puzzle missing and they&rsquo;re trying to figure out what could of possibly happened to some poor person they call us in. We&rsquo;re crime scene investigators who specialize in forensic science and criminology.</p>

<p><strong>Would it be fair to call &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; a spin off of the &ldquo;X-Files&rdquo;?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a huge &ldquo;X-Files&rdquo; fan, so I love all those elements about &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; that could be compared to the &ldquo;X-Files.&rdquo; But we don&rsquo;t&rsquo; dabble that much in mysticism. But of course that door is always open because we&rsquo;re dealing in the unknown.</p>

<p>Some of the episodes are based -fairly loosely on true stories. Actually, I just finished a show yesterday where a tech advisor wrote the script of an incident that actually happened to her in real life. I can&rsquo;t tell you what it is yet but I will tell you that it was really cool to do knowing that this event really happened to somebody.</p>

<p><strong>I like how you spell your name by the way, Jorja.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you! My mom made it up.</p>

<p><strong>So that&rsquo;s your real name?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) Yes!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you leave &ldquo;ER&rdquo; when it was doing so well?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;ER&rdquo; kind of just fizzled out. There was some room for me to come back, but I thought they had played out the story with me.</p>

<p><strong>I heard Eric LaSalle is really hard to work with. Well?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) Did you know he&rsquo;s a black belt in karate? He really is a very grounded guy and I think that can be intimidating to a lot of people. But he&rsquo;s really really nice. What I loved most about Eric LaSalle was that he and I weren&rsquo;t that great at the technical stuff back when the show first aired. So we were always having to do extra takes to figure out that medical terminology.</p>

<p>**He actually told me that. Well you both convinced a lot of people that you actually knew what you were talking about. **</p>

<p>Most of the time! In fact it got so bad that friends starting calling me asking me what to do for a headache. I would just say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! Go to a doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Do people really expect you to know how to treat their medical problems just because you play a doctor on TV?</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally! Which is very funny to me! One time there was an accident on the road and thank God nobody was hurt. But this guy was hit by a car so I stopped and called 911 and waited for someone to show up. And when the Paramedic pulled up he said hi to me like he knew me as a fellow paramedic. But then he realized I really wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>Do people usually recognize you on the street?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, sometimes that happens. I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself famous really. But occasionally people will talk to me and be really nice. I find that very flattering.</p>

<p><strong>Is it true that you also appeared on the very last episode of &ldquo;Ellen&rdquo; with Ellen DeGeneres?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah! It wasn&rsquo;t really the last show but it was the one hour long coming out show that I was on.</p>

<p><strong>Did you play a lesbian on the show?</strong></p>

<p>I had a small cameo and yes it was as a lesbian. Toward the end of the show Ellen drives to a lesbian bar for the first time in her life. Once she&rsquo;s at the bar I approach her but instead of asking Ellen out I ask her friend out. So, the joke was, even as a lesbian, Ellen still couldn&rsquo;t get a date.</p>

<p><strong>I always thought it was a big mistake for Ellen to come out. Her career took a nose dive right afterwards. In fact I was really surprised that her show didn&rsquo;t work after she came out. If anything I thought it would help.</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised too. I was actually really proud to be a part of that historic episode. I think it was really bold and cool for her to do it. There was so much pressure on her. Actually my character on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; was gay. That&rsquo;s why they asked me to be on that special &ldquo;Ellen&rdquo; episode. That show was full of so many huge celebrities, Jay Mohr, Billy Bob Thorton, Opra Winfrey and so many others. I couldn&rsquo;t believe I got to work with so many talented people.</p>

<p><strong>So why didn&rsquo;t the lesbian angle work for Ellen?</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know? But it didn&rsquo;t open the flood gates for shows like &ldquo;Will and Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>I agree. Before I let you go, I have to ask you this. Is it true you were run over by a limousine?</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) Yes! How did you know that?</p>

<p><strong>I have my sources. It happened while you were doing &ldquo;West Wing.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Right! I was run over by the presidential limousine! It was the last night of last season&rsquo;s show. We were shooting the scene where we all had to duck and run because the bullets where coming at us. It was very choreographed. We did it a couple of times and everything seemed fine. So I was lying face first on the ground then all of a sudden I felt something very heavy on my leg. So I turned around and it was this weird limousine running over my leg. I was really lucky I didn&rsquo;t break anything.</p>

<p><strong>Did you cry? I would have.</strong></p>

<p>(Laughs) I think a part of me is still in shock over it. I was shocked that it happened and shocked that I walked away from it. It was very strange.</p>

<p><strong>Is that why you left &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo;?</strong></p>

<p>No! It just seemed that &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; came out of nowhere and I was very interested in it. Plus I thought the story line to &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; might of played itself out. Plus it&rsquo;s not really about the secret service people anyway. Being one of the secret service people on the show I just didn&rsquo;t think my character had too much room to grow. But it was really a lot of fun to be a part of such a great show. I&rsquo;m a hardcore liberal person and I liked that on the &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; the good guys win. I experienced a lot of joy being a part of that show.</p>

<p><strong>Well I don&rsquo;t think anyone would disagree that you made the right choice moving over to &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. The show is the most watched show on television. Three shows, three hits. You&rsquo;re batting a 1,000.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks! I&rsquo;m just lucky I guess!</p>

		<p>Before she landed the role of scientist Sara Sidle on <em>C.S.I.</em>, actress Jorja Fox&rsquo;s life was literally going to the dogs.</p>

<p><strong>What was your first job?</strong><br />
I worked at a kennel in New York City called the Montrose Pet Hotel. That was when I was 16, so I have no idea if it&rsquo;s still there or not.</p>

<p><strong>What did you have to do?</strong><br />
I would feed the dogs, and I&rsquo;d take them from their little hotels to these indoor dog runs. In New York City, the insurance for kennels to walk dogs outside was so expensive that they would walk the dogs inside. It was a great job &#8212; I loved it.</p>

<p><strong>What was the best thing about that job?</strong><br />
I loved my clients. (laughs)</p>

<p><strong>Was there anything really bad about it?</strong></p>

<p>Not really. For the most part it was just me, and I could listen to music, and I could wear whatever I wanted?it was just a great, great job.</p>

<p><strong>So how many dogs do you have now?</strong><br />
I have a dog named Ali &#8212; she&rsquo;s a boxer &#8212; and two cats named Rumplestiltskin and Sid Poitier. I didn&rsquo;t name them, though; they came with those names. In fact, Sid was originally named Sid Vicious, but when he started to act too much like his namesake, I changed his name to Sid Poitier.</p>

<p><strong>Did you learn anything at that job that&rsquo;s stuck with you?</strong><br />
I learned a lot. I learned some discipline, because I had to be there very early in the morning; I learned how to work on my own; and I learned a lot about compassion.</p>

<p><strong>Your character on <em>C.S.I.</em> sees a lot of dead people. Have you ever had a job where you saw dead people?</strong></p>

<p>When I was 15, I volunteered at an emergency room in Florida, and there were a couple times when people passed away.</p>

<p><strong>Ever had a job that made you dead tired?</strong><br />
Yeah, <em>C.S.I.</em> I love it so much, but I&rsquo;m burnt. I think this summer I&rsquo;m just going to sleep late.</p>

<p><strong>What was your first paid acting gig?</strong><br />
I did this independent movie called <em>The Kill-Off</em> in 1989, but then it was another full year before I got another job.</p>

<p><strong>The clich&eacute; about actors is that they&rsquo;ve all worked as waiters. Did you?</strong><br />
I did everything in clubs and bars, though I only worked as a waiter one night when someone was sick. But it was such a disaster that they never had me do it again.</p>

<p><strong>Before you hit it big, what was your favorite cheap meal?</strong><br />
Pizza. In New York, especially, I had this idea in my head that I was a pizza connoisseur, so I tried to try every pizza place in the city.</p>

<p><strong>Do you still eat a lot of pizza?</strong><br />
Yeah, when I&rsquo;m in New York.</p>

<p><strong>If you hadn&rsquo;t become an actress, what would you be doing today?</strong></p>

<p>I would&rsquo;ve loved to have gotten involved in politics. Not necessarily as a politician, but maybe as someone working behind the scenes.</p>

<p><strong>So what advice would you have for someone looking for their first job?</strong><br />
Look for something that really interests you, be yourself, and trust that the day will come when people will listen to you.</p>

<p><strong>C.S.I.</strong> <em>airs Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m. on CBS.</em></p>

<p>Jorja Fox (who can&rsquo;t keep her mouth shut on TV&rsquo;s CSI.) has the dialogue-free part of Shelby&rsquo;s murdered wife. It seems like the wife ought to be the most important role. It seems also that this role was cast haphazardly, but maybe the problem is that Nolan didn&rsquo;t create a more poignant sense of lost marital love.</p>

<p>When it goes Rashamonic and metaphysical at the disappointing end of the story, Memento gropes for a broader significance it doesn&rsquo;t earn. Sliced in a new direction, Memento is still the same old B-movie baloney. Only an audience of amnesiacs would find it completely groundbreaking.</p>

		<p><strong>T</strong>here&rsquo;s a line in <em>Memento</em>, written and directed by Christopher Nolan, where Guy Pearce (<em>L.A. Confidential</em>), as tormented lead character Leonard Shelby, is asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last thing you remember?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;My wife.&rdquo; But the sum of what he can piece together from his injury-induced chronic loss of short-term memory is &ldquo;the feel of a person.&rdquo; Jorja Fox, who suffers a <em>Psycho</em>-like death and haunts the film as Shelby&rsquo;s memory of his murdered wife, does exactly that on the screen: creates the feel of a person. It&rsquo;s this instinctive ability to mine the white space on a page of dialogue that really calls attention to a Jorja Fox performance. While you may not have her name on the tip of your tongue at the moment, the surprise hit show &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; (CBS) may be the platform that will launch this young actor into the national consciousness.That&rsquo;s because Jorja is doing something with her craft that isn&rsquo;t seen a lot: she&rsquo;s not only <em>acting</em>, she&rsquo;s <em>listening</em>. And the actor&rsquo;s reference points are &ldquo;personal.&rdquo; Born in New York, but raised in the small Florida town of Melbourne Beach, Fox&rsquo;s path into the profession reads like a teen fantasy. Local girl enters a modeling contest with friends; wins the contest despite the just-rolled-out-of-bed tomboy look; ends up on photo shoots in Europe; retires by the age of 18; decides to act. Then she gets cast to do guest spots on shows like &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ellen&rdquo;; stars in NBC&rsquo;s huge hit &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and moves on to the Emmy award-winning series &ldquo;The West Wing.&rdquo; And now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; where she plays the gung-ho junior member of the investigative team, forensics investigator Sara Sidle.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not including her indie credits: <em>Forever Fabulous</em>, <em>Down With the Joneses</em>, and, of course, <em>Memento</em>, where she gets to be a corpse not unlike the ubiquitous bodies that people the storylines of &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; But the CBS show offers something more than a mystery to solve with each episode. Starring William Petersen (who also produces), Marg Helgenberger, George Eads, and Gary Dourdan, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is about healing, about coping with the enormous violence all around us.</p>

<p>Ironically, in her last season on &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; she was a near-casualty, literally run over by an armored limousine. &ldquo;Not just a limo, a two-ton Presidential limo.&rdquo; Luckily, she survived the errant tire and actually wanted to keep on working despite the bruises. But that just speaks more to her post-Modern appeal, the rare combination of gritty realism tempered with genuine optimism in the face of challenging times. Coming from a place of honesty, Jorja Fox is on the trail to find her destiny, and the public is getting a clue about what this girl can do.</p>

<p><strong>Venice: So one day you found yourself having a cappuccino in Italy, being a teen model. That must have been culture shock.</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox: I thought, &#8216;What the hell am I doing in Italy?&rsquo; Culture shock was moving to New York! I was a terrible model; I just wasn&rsquo;t that person. It was better in Europe than New York. I would get out of bed and not brush my hair.</p>

<p>I wanted to be an actress from a young age. Part of the reason [I did modeling] was that it was an opportunity to go to New York City. It was great-coming from this small town. I studied at Lee Strasberg Academy &hellip; also with Bill Hickey (<em>Prizzi&rsquo;s Honor</em>).</p>

<p><strong>William Hickey was a great actor.</strong></p>

<p>He&rsquo;s dead now. Nobody could believe he was teaching classes down at this place in the village. He was very ethereal and would go around stuff. Other acting teachers would say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re forcing it.&rdquo; He would just tell a story-about a vineyard in Ireland, and it would all make sense. I loved his class.</p>

<p><strong>What did you see as a career trajectory?</strong></p>

<p>I tried to play down the modeling thing, like a model who wants to be an actor. People look at that with a snicker or a grin. I retired at 18. It was kind of funny. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for a second. I was also playing music at the time. I had two loves: acting and music.</p>

<p><strong>Had you been doing indie films all the while you were doing TV?</strong></p>

<p>The first job I ever got was an indie movie. I sort of chased movies for a long time, but TV offered opportunities. I still love movies. [At first] I really liked movies over TV; now that&rsquo;s changed. With movies you work hard over a short period. In the past I had commitment issues [with the time required to do series TV]. Then I realized I had been working three years steadily, really enjoying it, and never flaked out! In the beginning I was so scared.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get over your fear?</strong></p>

<p>The actual practicality of doing it day after day takes over.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of being scared, what about the car thing?</strong></p>

<p>[During the taping of an assasination attempt on &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;] I was run over by a limo, and I walked away from it. It was moving really slow, three or four miles an hour. I never saw it coming; I never had a chance to tense up. It was a two-ton limo, it wasn&rsquo;t even a standard limo. It was a huge master [scene], and we were laughing because we were face down on the pavement. I saw the wheel just coming off my leg. They yelled, &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; There were four guys who picked me up; it happened at about 9 pm. It was our last night of the season. [After the medical exam and no broken bones were found] They said, &ldquo;Go home.&rdquo; But I felt if I went home, I would have freaked out a lot more. After that, I was a little paranoid about accidents.</p>

<p><strong>How did you get over it?</strong></p>

<p>On &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; I went up in a helicopter. I was kind of terrified, but I decided I could do it. It was better than therapy!</p>

<p><strong>Did Aaron Sorkin write you out of &ldquo;The West Wing?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>No. He didn&rsquo;t write me out. They left me alive. It was kind of great for me that they let me walk away without a scratch. Aaron is one of the greatest geniuses I have ever had the pleasure of talking to and working with.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo; seems to be such a hit you may not be able to go back to &ldquo;West Wing,&rdquo; even if the door is open.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the new level of shock, how well &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is doing. We&rsquo;re all obviously very surprised. I think people like the mystery and the puzzles. I think that people like feeling like they are solving the puzzle with the story. You can watch it, and there are thrills. You are actively able to see what happened .</p>

<p>**You mean people feel relieved that there&rsquo;s going to be a resolve? **</p>

<p>Somebody either did it or they didn&rsquo;t do it. But it&rsquo;s really not a judgment. It is what&rsquo;s real-not &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cop I&rsquo;m on the right side of the law.&rdquo; I think [the characters ] are human, flawed.</p>

<p><strong>And it&rsquo;s not &#8216;sci-fi-ed&rsquo; out.</strong></p>

<p>The world in general right now is sort of undefinable-not like when it was the 50&rsquo;s. Not everything is so cut and dried. In the 2000&rsquo;s, there are so many things [to consider]-the environment, all the people who make a living off the environment. We&rsquo;re sort of in this gray area between resources that need protecting and people that need to make their living.</p>

<p>**I know you&rsquo;re a vegetarian; are you vegan? **</p>

<p>I aspire to vegan! On &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; [my character] was eating fish in a scene. I don&rsquo;t normally eat fish, but she does. I was eating Chilean seabass-and [someone pointed out] that it is in danger of extinction. They said, &ldquo;You might want to know your character is eating an animal that&rsquo;s on the extinct list.&rdquo; But I didn&rsquo;t know until we shot it.</p>

<p><strong>It seems like you are finding a way to make everything work together-your principles and your craft.</strong></p>

<p>It has been luck, really. If [a project] says something close to my heart, if it makes a statement, that&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s all been sort of luck. With &ldquo;The West Wing,&rdquo; it was an amazing working relationship for me. You rarely get to say that much about the world at large. I felt like a tiny link to some kind of truth.</p>

<p><strong>How did <em>Memento</em> come about?</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been really cool, too. We shot that a year and a half ago. I had heard really great things about the script. I was contacted really close to the shoot date. I loved working with Guy Pearce. He is one of my favorite husbands. I&rsquo;ve only had a couple. I&rsquo;ve been really lucky in the husband category!</p>

<p><strong>Your character is Guy&rsquo;s obsession. Have you seen the completed film?</strong></p>

<p>At the premiere, I hadn&rsquo;t seen it yet. The hard part was that people kept asking me about it before I was going in. They had really specific questions, like, &ldquo;That scene with the prostitute in the bathroom, what did it mean?&rdquo; At first I tried to answer the questions, then I started lying! I was really paranoid because of it.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is going to change things. Are you getting recognized by people yet?</strong></p>

<p>I live in the same neighborhood-go to the same places. I haven&rsquo;t really gone outside the realm. When we break, start traveling, and leave L.A., it will be interesting to see what happens. People are so cool in this town anyway. People who have taken the time [to acknowledge me on the street] have been really great, nice, and supportive. It&rsquo;s good feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Your character doesn&rsquo;t have much of a personal life. Will this change as the show progresses?</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hard decision. We developed a show about the stories and not about the people. People have really liked that going into year two. There was sort of a decision that if you found out things about [the characters] it would be through their jobs. You get to know people first, before you get to know their intimate details.</p>

<p><strong>What are your intimate details?</strong></p>

<p>You mean me, or my character?</p>

<p><strong>Both. Come on, think of something!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with Sara first. An intimate detail about Sara is that there is something dark in her past that involves her in the work that she is doing. Not something that happened to her personally, but someone close to her. We&rsquo;re still forming that; she might be one of the characters who has a reference point. I love that she&rsquo;s not a cop, that there are gray areas, not representing moral authority. She just has the skills. You can never afford closure, give certainty to people. [In &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;] they can&rsquo;t go back and fix what happened to people, they can just come in after the worst day of [the survivors&rsquo;] lives and see what they can do to help. I think that&rsquo;s what the show is about.</p>

<p><strong>It does focus on recovering and healing.</strong></p>

<p>In Western society in general, the &ldquo;d&rdquo; word is never used. Everyone at some point is going to have to deal with death on a personal level. It&rsquo;s a vague, conceptual thing for a lot of people in America. This show takes a very good look at that, and that&rsquo;s why it is so popular-people are watching.</p>

<p><strong>Okay. Now your intimate detail. You thought I forgot, right?</strong></p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t. What do you mean by an intimate detail?</p>

<p><strong>Something in your life that is a reference point. I know you had a friend whose mom died a violent death.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah. That, and my mom passed four years ago. My friend&rsquo;s mom was murdered. It was violent and aggressive, horrible. My mom died of an illness (ovarian cancer), and her death was very fast for an illness. Very fast and very slow-a couple of years separated my friend and me, her mother and my mother. Those two really stand out for me.</p>

<p><strong>Did you incorporate her illness into your own work as an actor?</strong></p>

<p>When I got the job on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; my mom had been sick, and the first day I started [shooting] I got the call that things were a lot more grave than I thought. It stayed with me for the length of the show. The first two seasons were a balancing act: a great job and a horrific thing going on personally. My mom made me promise that I wouldn&rsquo;t [go home]. That&rsquo;s my reference for &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; because we&rsquo;re dealing with loss and death.</p>

<p><strong>You do as much with silences as you do with dialogue. Are you aware that you are doing this?</strong></p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s the whole idea of listening. I&rsquo;ve seen that with other actors-the moment where it could be an actor&rsquo;s most brilliant moment, where the actor says nothing. There are also times when it&rsquo;s great to have this five-page dialogue, like Mamet. Our shows are great because most of the time we&rsquo;re talking about the science.</p>

<p><strong>Is your name your mom&rsquo;s creation?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. She was French Canadian. The idea of the &ldquo;J&rdquo; was a novel idea. My dad was of Irish descent-but it was weird at that time [in Canada]. It was like being black or Mexican, and white. There was a lot of animosity around everybody mixing. There&rsquo;s still some flavor of that in Montreal. They left it all behind. I&rsquo;m named after four relatives!</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next for you?</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I won&rsquo;t be able to work [during the strike]; maybe it&rsquo;s better to travel, just to recharge and bring stuff back to my work. We&rsquo;re pretending that we&rsquo;re having a life when we act, but it&rsquo;s cool to have one to use as a reference.</p>

<p><strong>So you&rsquo;ll strike if that happens?</strong></p>

<p>I definitely support the union. I don&rsquo;t want to strike, but it&rsquo;s a hard year with the contracts. We are like athletes, the career span is shorter. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox has appeared in a number of prominent television shows, including E.R., C.S.I. and West Wing. In Memento, she shows up as the victimized wife of Leonard Shelby - only seen in flashback sequences. For her, the experience of filming the film was almost like a dream because she only had to be on-set for a few days. &ldquo;I filmed, I think, three days out of 29. So I had a very short, easy time,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>At the premiere&rsquo;s after-party, she told Zap2it that she was thoroughly impressed by what she had seen. It had been the first time she had seen the film all the way through. While some audience members may have left confused, though, Fox had the benefit of knowing how the story ended before ever sitting down. &ldquo;I thought it was great,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to see it again already - knowing the ending is very helpful for seeing it from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Getting cast for the part, Fox knew very little about the story when she accepted the role. Of course she had read the script, but there were many nuances that she wasn&rsquo;t quite clear about. She ended up seeking out some help to understand what was going on. &ldquo;I really did read the script several times,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I cornered Guy (Pearce), because he&rsquo;s in every scene, so I&rsquo;m like &#8216;You must know what&rsquo;s going on. Come on, help me out.&rsquo; And then I cornered Chris (the director) about it, but he&rsquo;s extremely ambiguous - which he seems committed to, which is very cool. And tonight I feel like at least I think I understand the stuff. I&rsquo;m not sure if I got it right, but I left there with an understanding of what I thought was happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I realized very quickly that I had lucked out in a huge way that I was getting to do something really cool,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You always hope that you get to do something interesting or different or smart - makes a statement. You always hope for that kind of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
