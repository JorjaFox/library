		<p>Actress** Jorja Fox** is standing in the middle of an airplane hangar in Boulder, Colorado, watching the doors of a Bolivian cargo jet open up. While the sun sets over the Rocky Mountains, individual crates housing twenty-five African lions are unloaded. Although from different prides, the lions share the same fate: rescued from circus abuse, they&rsquo;re about to embark on a new life. All of a sudden, one lion after the other starts roaring, the sound bouncing off the walls in the giant hangar. A lion&rsquo;s roar can travel up to five miles, and the roars turn into a symphony never before heard on the Colorado plains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sound that completely penetrates you,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;You can feel those roars in your muscles and bones. If something like that had happened in the wild, where I was surrounded by twenty-five lions, I would&rsquo;ve been petrified! But I wasn&rsquo;t scared. It was one of the most amazing things I&rsquo;ve ever felt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Animal rescuer is a role that suits Jorja perfectly. A vegetarian since age 18, she became an ambassador for Animal Defenders International six years ago and has since saved both elephants and lions. The historic lion rescue, which is the subject of the documentary <em>Lion Ark</em>, is the largest of its kind and was the result of ADI&rsquo;s work helping ban the use of circus animals in Bolivia. &ldquo;If you knew the abuse the animals suffer behind-the-scenes, you would never set your foot in a circus,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;There are far cooler things these animals can be doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At home in Los Angeles, the actress spends time with another four-legged creature, her rescue dog Bexar. And she gets a major kick out of her role as Sara Sidle on <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, which recently celebrated its 300th episode. &ldquo;The scripts still give me nightmares!&rdquo; says Jorja, who also starred on <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>. &ldquo;I only read them at night if I&rsquo;m absolutely desperate. I rather get up first thing in the morning so my brain has all day to organize all those gory details and put them away somewhere before I go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja, who was photographed for <em>Sweden With Love</em> by <strong>Elizabeth Messina</strong>, has a quick, easy laugh that is utterly contagious. In an <strong>exclusive interview</strong>, she talks surprisingly honestly — and hilariously — about being in her mid 40s. She also dishes on working with the &ldquo;very distracting&rdquo; <strong>George Clooney</strong> for three years on <em>ER</em>, how she keeps in shape and the secret passion she&rsquo;s &ldquo;not very good at&rdquo; but still loves. Jorja&rsquo;s kindness and gutsy spirit is refreshing, and her joy for life is contagious. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: It&rsquo;s not often you find a woman — especially in Hollywood — as comfortable in her own skin as you are. You seem to have avoided all the trappings of turning 40.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> You know, I tried to lie about my age for years! I cheated myself down five years for the longest time. But then one day, the Internet just corrected it. Now, my age is everywhere and there&rsquo;s no way to escape it. Everybody knows how old I am! I couldn&rsquo;t hide it even if I wanted to.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: How do you deal with the pressure of staying eternally young? I think we all experience it on some level, even if we&rsquo;re not in the public eye like you are.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It really helps to have other women around you that are about the same age and who look and feel great about themselves. You know what&rsquo;s cool? Elisabeth Shue and I are on the show together and we&rsquo;re close in age. She&rsquo;s gorgeous and down-to-earth and that&rsquo;s really inspiring to me. It&rsquo;s so fun, especially now being in my mid 40s, to have another woman around who is dealing with the same issues I am. I look at her and go, ‘Wow, she looks amazing!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think any of us ever thought we&rsquo;d get old on <em>CSI</em>, and no, we&rsquo;re not getting old yet, but we&rsquo;re aging very publicly and sometimes that can be hard. It&rsquo;s a good problem to have, of course, but it&rsquo;s nice to be able to share thoughts about wrinkles with other women who are the same age as you.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: You know that phenomenon that happens when you live in L.A. and no one ever gets older? Do you ever feel that way?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes! I have a grandmother here, so I see a whole bunch of senior citizens regularly. But I don&rsquo;t really see people aging. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anyone in between here. There are senior citizens and then there are all these other ageless people. I guess you&rsquo;ve got to go somewhere else, you&rsquo;ve got to disappear for a decade, and then come back and reintroduce yourself as a senior citizen with white hair [laugh].</p>

<p>**Ulrica: I find that, for each year that goes by, there&rsquo;s also a greater sense of freedom because you stop caring about all the crap you used to care about.<br />
**</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> You&rsquo;re so right. I really don&rsquo;t care about what people think about me and it&rsquo;s such a relief. When I was in my 20s and 30s, I always thought about how I was perceived. Was I pretty enough? Was I cool enough? I just don&rsquo;t have those anxieties anymore. I don&rsquo;t worry about if I&rsquo;m pretty enough or cool enough or fashionable enough. Those are the shallow ways we torture ourselves when we&rsquo;re younger! That said, it&rsquo;s still really important to me how people perceive me in terms of being a decent human being. But that stage when you&rsquo;re constantly worrying about if you&rsquo;re pretty enough or loud enough or quiet enough or <em>anything</em> enough? I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m over that stage. There&rsquo;s such freedom in not having to worry about those things.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: Okay, give me the dirt. You worked with George Clooney for three years on <em>ER</em>. Is he really as cool as he seems?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, he&rsquo;s really as cool as he seems. He really is. Even from thirty feet away, there&rsquo;s that energy and charisma. You can&rsquo;t quite escape it. It&rsquo;s this amazingness and sexiness that radiate from wherever he is. It&rsquo;s really <em>really</em> distracting! I don&rsquo;t think I ever got over it, even during the three years that I worked with him. On top of that, he&rsquo;s so funny and disarming. During rehearsals, he would spend the entire time telling jokes and doing pranks. You never rehearsed until you were shooting with him. It would always throw me off my game. So yes, he&rsquo;s a really great, talented and very distracting man!</p>

<p>**Ulrica: <em>ER</em> was a huge hit when you joined the cast, and that was a big turning point for you. So many actors on that show were catapulted into fame. Were you scared at all? **</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I was completely terrified. I thought, &ldquo;This is the moment when everyone in the world is going to realize I&rsquo;m an impostor.&rdquo; So many people were watching that show. There was this very real moment, the day before I was going to start on <em>ER</em>, when I was sitting in my apartment in LA mapping out my escape to Mexico. I had it all planned out. I was going to drive to Mexico that night and be there before the morning. I would then call my manager and say I&rsquo;d quit acting before any damage had been done. It was that moment of, &ldquo;This is it. You either get out now or you move forward.&rdquo; Fortunately, I decided to move forward. But every day I was there, I thought, &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t fire me today, they&rsquo;ll fire me tomorrow.&rdquo; I still think that sometimes when I drive in to work on <em>CSI</em>. It certainly keeps me on my toes. But I&rsquo;ve been on a show now for 18 consecutive seasons now, so I&rsquo;m going to have to go for 20!</p>

<p>**Ulrica: As a child, I never felt comfortable visiting the zoo or going to the circus, and I refuse to take my own kids to a circus or a zoo now. So your work raising awareness about animals in circuses really speaks to me. **</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> So many of us, when we were kids and went to the circus or the zoo or the marine park for the first time, sensed there was something we didn&rsquo;t like. Yes, it&rsquo;s amazing to be able to see these animals, but the conditions they&rsquo;re living in are not right. You take these huge land mammals like elephants, who easily walks 30 miles a day in the wild, and put them in tiny cages until they have to perform, sometimes several times a day, for years and years until they die. They&rsquo;re abused, hit and scared into performing and they develop serious mental and physical illnesses. The bull hook, for example, is a standard instrument used for training elephants and it&rsquo;s very violent. Watching <em>Lion Ark</em>, it&rsquo;s so easy to connect the dots.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: Why do you think there&rsquo;s such a disconnect between our natural love for animals and the way they&rsquo;re actually treated in our society?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I think we&rsquo;re taught from a very early age to have a certain mindset in relation to animals. They&rsquo;re in our clothing, in our diets, in our makeup…they&rsquo;re entertainment and they&rsquo;re our pets. In some ways, you have to shut down to accept some of the roles animals play in modern society. You have to detach and disassociate yourself with the meat that&rsquo;s in the grocery store, or the animals performing at the circus, or the leather shoes you&rsquo;re wearing, in order to live life a certain way. You don&rsquo;t have to think about your dinner choices at all, unless you really want to go out of your way to think about them. Society makes it easy for us to ignore these complex issues. But I think twenty years from now, with these environmental issues reaching such critical mass, there will be enormous progress in terms of the way we treat animals. I think people are very compassionate in general, and we all want to do the right thing.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: So many people say, ‘Why do you care about animal rights when people are starving all over the world?&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m extremely passionate about human rights, environmental rights <em>and</em> animal welfare and it would be very hard for me to separate the three. They&rsquo;re all interconnected and interrelated. If you look beneath the surface of an animal welfare issue, you&rsquo;ll usually find an environmental issue and a human rights issue.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: You&rsquo;ve been a vegetarian for 25 years. Why is that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I believe in non-violence, so it was a really easy thing for me to do. Living in New York and Los Angeles, there was no reason for me to eat meat for my survival. It&rsquo;s worked out really great and I don&rsquo;t miss meat at all. For me, it was never really for health reasons, but so many of the things we&rsquo;re now learning about health and nutrition makes it a really exciting time to be a vegetarian or vegan. The cuisine is busting out! Some of the most exciting cuisine on the planet is happening in vegetarian or vegan cooking.</p>

<p>**Ulrica: I became a vegan on a silly dare two years ago, just because I wanted to lose weight after I had my third child. I know my intentions were not the most honorable, but my body felt so different that I stuck with it. And I swear, in the process, my heart changed. In general, I just feel more compassion. **</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong>: That&rsquo;s fascinating! I was 18 when I became a vegetarian, so I don&rsquo;t remember some of the more subtle things, but it doesn&rsquo;t shock me. You know, even if you don&rsquo;t want to become a vegetarian or vegan, it&rsquo;s a great thing to try out. Do meatless Mondays to start, and see how you feel. Even if you don&rsquo;t care about animals or the environment, you&rsquo;ll lose weight and you&rsquo;ll feel better. And if you do care about animals and the environment…truthfully, the single greatest thing anyone could do for animals or the environment on a daily basis is to become a vegetarian or vegan.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: We need to talk about your dog Bexar, because she&rsquo;s too adorable!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong>: She was found roaming the streets of San Antonio, Texas, so that&rsquo;s why I named her Bexar. She&rsquo;s a curly, floppy mutt that probably has some poodle in her. When we found each other, I had just lost my dog of fourteen years. My dog died in January, and when Bexar showed up in my life in May I wasn&rsquo;t quite ready for another dog. I actually spent the first months kind of pushing her away a bit, and she did the same to me. I don&rsquo;t think she wanted me, either! Then all of a sudden, it flipped. Now I&rsquo;m completely in love with her. I adore her and she&rsquo;s amazing. She&rsquo;s the coolest, little scruffiest dog I ever knew.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: I know you love to surf. Is that how you keep fit?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I never feel all that fit, but I love to work out because it calms my mind. I love to surf. I love to just be in the ocean and be a part of nature, and it keeps you really fit. Paddling out gives you a great arm and back workout. I also do yoga, and I take my dog [she has a rescue mutt, part poodle, that she found in Texas] on hikes. When I can&rsquo;t go surfing, I work out with my trainer John Pierre at home. We have a routine I just started this summer that is tailored for me and keeps my body fit for surfing when I can&rsquo;t get out in the water.</p>

<p><strong>Ulrica: Lastly, do you have a secret talent no one knows about?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> [laugh] Probably not! But I really love to garden. I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m any good at it, but I love it so much. And I love to meander around my house. I&rsquo;ve never had a designer or a decorator. I don&rsquo;t have any talent for home decor, but it&rsquo;s something that I secretly enjoy when I have the time. I like to find things that are vintage or reclaimed. I&rsquo;ve had my house for almost ten years, and it&rsquo;s still not done! But part of me doesn&rsquo;t want it to be done, because I don&rsquo;t want the project to be over. There are still rooms that need to be painted and pieces I have to find, like a new table for my breakfast nook. I&rsquo;ve been looking for that table for two years! So even though it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m talent at, it&rsquo;s a secret passion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja recently produced the award-winning documentary <em>How I Became An Elephant</em>, about one young girl&rsquo;s mission to travel to Asia to work with her hero, The Elephant Lady, and save elephants in captivity.</p>

		<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s episode of CSI marks the CBS procedural&rsquo;s 300th episode, and no matter how you slice it, that&rsquo;s a lot of murder.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Realizing the show would reach the milestone this season, executive producer Don McGill says they wanted this entire season in general, and the 300th episode in particular, to look back at the show&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;When Carol and I talked about the season, [we thought,] &#8216;Back to the beginning,&lsquo;&rdquo; McGill says. &ldquo;And looking at episode 300, literally we do go back to the beginning. We reference a case that was the one that got away for our CSIs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case hits particularly close to home for Sara (Jorja Fox). &ldquo;It was her first high-profile case when she came to Las Vegas,&rdquo; Fox tells us. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s getting a second chance at something. She&rsquo;s been dealing with the family for all these years and not having the answers. There&rsquo;s a weight and a sadness that she carries. But by the end, I think she absolutely gets some closure. And she feels fairly anchored, as much as Sara can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case involves a reclusive casino mogul (guest star Jason Priestley) who is suspected in a crime eerily similar to the case from 14 years ago. As the CSIs dig for clues, the show uses what McGill calls &ldquo;faux-backs&rdquo; to tie the two cases together. In addition to seeing Sara and Greg (Eric Szmanda) in circa 2000 looks, the episode also welcomes back original cast member Marg Helgenberger as Catherine Willows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We created these little vignettes,&rdquo; McGill says. &ldquo;It gave us a chance to have a window in the evolution of the characters. You could really see how far Sara has come, how far Greg has come, the influence of Catherine. It was a really fun opportunity to give a nod to how great the show is and how its longevity has really created this dynamic where we&rsquo;ve seen the characters grow and evolve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The episode will feature lots of Easter eggs, including 14 different references to the number 300. But Mendelsohn says the episode also pays appropriate homage to the show&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s been asking, &#8216;What are your favorite episodes? What moments do you remember the best on set?&lsquo;&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And because we want to hark back to those iconic moments of the past, we flash back to some of the golden oldie cases. We took a poll among all the writers: What are your favorite cases? And those are the cases we flash back to during the episode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In particular, the show pays homage to the show&rsquo;s original protagonist and leader, William Petersen&rsquo;s Gil Grissom. Although Grissom has only appeared a handful of times since the character was written out in Season 9, his spirit seems to always loom over the action. Mendelsohn gives Petersen credit for much of the show&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy said, &#8216;I do not want Gil Grissom to always be right.&rsquo; That became our mantra,&rdquo; Mendelsohn says. &ldquo;It allowed us to create this incredible, iconic, forensic detective. Because of Billy&rsquo;s instructions, he was both a student of the world and a teacher of the world. He has had such longevity and such a continuing presence on the show [because] Grissom taught all of our CSIs. And he was the teacher of all of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;[He took] us into a world that none of us had any exposure to and then to make science entertaining and exciting,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;Grissom held our hand and took us on that journey to the truth. So, we are reverential and referential to Grissom, but it&rsquo;s because Gil Grissom started us all on the path to forensics. He was a new kind of detective. And in a world that was often gray, Grissom always led us to the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And will that legacy lead to another 300 episodes? &ldquo;Greg says something to Sara at the end of 300,&rdquo; McGill says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something to the effect of, &#8216;We&rsquo;re only just getting started&rsquo; I think Carol and I agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CSI airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS.</p>

		<p>Over 14 seasons and 300 episodes, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has concocted some wild plots and brought in memorable guest stars to keep the body-bagging business fresh and fun. We asked the cast - including Marg Helgenberger, who reprises her role as Catherine Willows for Wednesday&rsquo;s landmark 300th episode, which flashes back to a case the team failed to crack in 2000 - to reflect on the show&rsquo;s best installments, selected by longtime executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;1. Blood Drops (Season 1, Episode 7)&ldquo;&rsquo; A 6-year-old Dakota Fanning plays the surviving daughter of a family that&rsquo;s been butchered in their home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nightmares frm time to time about this one,&rdquo; admits Jorja Fox (Sara). &ldquo;Grissom [William Petersen] and Sara arrived so quickly after the murders that you could still feel the horrible events. I had one line - &#8216;Her soul&rsquo;s still in the room&rsquo; - which has stayed with me as [emblematic] of the entire series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;7. Law of Gravity (Season 7, Episode 15)&ldquo;&rsquo; A cop threatens to expose the dark past of fill-in boss Keppler (Liev Schreiber) if he doesn&rsquo;t make the evidence in a case go away. &ldquo;What a joy it was to have Liev with us for four episodes when Billy [Petersen] went to Chicago to do a play,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;But we all knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well for Keppler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;10. CSI on Fire (Season 13, Episode 8)&ldquo;&rsquo; A mass grave in the desert is linked to an accused serial killer whom Finlay (Elisabeth Shue) pursued when she worked in Seattle. &ldquo;Once in a while, the case is so close to your character that you get emotionally connected, which makes for deeper, richer scenes,&rdquo; says Shue, who adds that she enjoyed making out with Finlay&rsquo;s ex-husband (Cougar Town&rsquo;s Brian Van Holt) at the end of the episode. According to Fox, &ldquo;This storyline will come back later this season, when Fin will have to confront her past in Seattle so she can bravely help out Greg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CSI airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox is best known for her role as Dr. Maggie Doyle in the television medical drama <em>ER</em>. Since then, Fox has had many successful appearances in television shows including <em>The West Wing</em> and most recently <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> playing Sara Sidle. Fox talks about her career, how <em>CSI</em> changed her life, and what fans could expect this season.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What does it feel like to reflect on your career and know that you have been on some of the biggest shows in history like <em>ER</em></strong></p>

<p>Fox: Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. I started on ER in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. People had to actually turn on the TV at the right time a lot of the bigger shows people wanted to watch live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. I hadnt watched ER and it was my moms favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor and that I wasnt a good actorits just crazy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: So after <em>ER</em> you did a ton of television shows and then you land <em>CSI,</em> which again is another huge show. Where was your mind set when you heard you got the role of Sara?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: That was also a big surprise. I really didnt think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was really different and something that I hadnt really read about oftenbut I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do and I was so wrong about that. I thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How has Sara changed from Season one to Season thirteen?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think in someways she really hasnt changed that much [laughs]. When we met Sara in 2000 I think she was very much a product of her past and her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be apart of CSI that stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7 and was gone most of season 8 she had a time to wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself. Here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of how I have been playing the character.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What can fans look forward to this season?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think so far we are in the middle of episode 7. I think we have an amazing season opening up and some great guest stars like oh you know what I dont know if I could say. We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff  I think the writers this year again suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper. We start the season with a funeral and its not really until we get to the end of the episode that we find out why we are all there and whose funeral it is, who has passed. Its a very compelling and suspenseful episode.</p>

		<p>The 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.</p>

<p>A cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.</p>

<p>The evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series. The actor, who also appeared on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and in a story arc on &ldquo;The West Wing,&rdquo; seems to have a knack for connecting with popular television dramas.</p>

<p>Fox was in Hawaii to promote the documentary &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; along with producers/filmmakers/activists Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, founders of Animal Defenders International.</p>

<p>The film depicts the rescue of 25 African lions from Bolivian circuses, in the wake of a 2010 law prohibiting the use of animals in traveling shows. Phillips and Creamer, whove made their first full-length film with &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; were right there every step of the way.</p>

<p>The subject matter is dramatic and gripping  the quest brought the filmmakers into remote parts of Bolivia, and often circuses were not cooperative. In the films opening scenes, a circus operator, waving a knife, slashes their tires to try to prevent a rescue.</p>

<p>It also has a happy ending, as Fox and the filmmakers take pains to point out: All of the lions at risk were airlifted out of Bolivia, finding a home at a sprawling sanctuary in Colorado, where a giant (80-acre) protective enclosure was custom-built for the lions to help them adjust to the colder climate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to think of it as an action-adventure-dramedy,&rdquo; Fox said, partially joking. &ldquo;There are some funny moments in it, but there is epic drama. To get to be a part of it was fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox was there as the lions were being taken to shelter in Colorado, as is seen in the film.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be surrounded by 25 roaring lions  that real, raw power was an experience Ill never forget,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Creamer can speak passionately about the mistreatment imposed on animals in traveling circuses, while Phillips emphasizes their work is based on strictly factual findings  often uncovered by working surreptitiously to gather evidence on the scene, as the filmmakers did for years in Bolivia.</p>

<p>FOX HAS worked with Phillips and Creamer for more than seven years, beginning with a collaboration on the short documentary film, &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant.&rdquo; Fox served as producer for that film, which exposes the treatment of elephants as &ldquo;performers&rdquo; in traveling shows and in movies.</p>

<p>Fox was involved with &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; from the beginning, consulting with the filmmakers on the eye-witness approach and stepping in front of the camera during scenes films when the lions arrive in Colorado.</p>

<p>Shes also supporting the film by appearing at HIFF. Shell be at Dole Cannery on Saturday, Oct. 12, for the screening of &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ive been passionate about the environment, marine protection and wildlife, all my life,&rdquo; Fox said, explaining why she got involved. Born in New York City, she lived in Melbourne, Florida with her family as a child. Now based in L.A., shes a surfer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very familiar with Hawaii, but I wasnt that familiar with the festival until Jan and Tim got invited to come,&rdquo; Fox confided.</p>

<p>As she spoke, a stylish woman with close-cropped hair leaned over our table to say, &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, but we love your show. I just had to come over and tell you that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE SHOW, of course, is &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; which is about to reach a huge milestone: the airing of its 300th episode.</p>

<p>The episode has already been filmed, Fox said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its going to be amazing, thats all I can say,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We didnt really think it was that big a deal until we started shooting it, and then we started realizing that its pretty rare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the new shows especially, so many of them are doing 13 episodes a season instead of 24  its going to take them 26 years to get to 300 episodes! I dont know that that many new shows are going to get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried to enjoy every minute&rdquo; of filming, she said. Special care was taken in writing the scenes, and some pieces of the episode pay tribute to the series long history, including &ldquo;faux-back&rdquo; segments that recreate characters storylines reaching back to the shows first year. Original cast member Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) is also back for the 300th show.</p>

<p>I asked Fox how long the wild ride that has been &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; can last, and she responded that its up to viewers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope my favorite episode is yet to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Its lasted far longer than I ever anticipated.  Now, I think Ill do it as long as the fans want us to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cant even imagine leaving at this point. It would seem foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IN THE MEANTIME, Fox is hoping for big audiences and international impact with &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo; The film was just awarded the Audience Award at the San Diego Film Festival, where it sold out its screening. Screenings also sold out at Londons Raindance Film Festival, an offshoot of Robert Redfords Sundance Film Festival in Colorado.</p>

<p>Asked what she learned from working on &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; Fox said, &ldquo;Anything is possible. If you put your heart and soul to it, you can move mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hawaiian Humane Society has teamed up with Animal Defenders International to promote &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; at HIFF. For more on efforts to improve conditions for captive or domesticated animals here in Hawaii, go to hawaiianhumane.org.</p>
