<p>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox is one gutsy gal. After eight seasons on one of TV&rsquo;s highest-rated shows, Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, is leaving. She wasn&rsquo;t fired. She decided not to renew her contract so she could pursue other interests. At least that&rsquo;s what she has told several publications. Will she be back? That&rsquo;s what fans of the Sara-Grissom relationship want to know. After all, they are engaged. A season-finale surprise appearance might be the way to go, if you ask me. 9 p.m. CBS</p>

<hr />

<p>There are a couple of notable departures on television tonight, csistarting Jorja Fox&rsquo;s last regular appearance as Sara Sidle on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; (9 p.m., CBS).</p>

<p>As you may already know, Fox &ndash; who has had a sometimes contentious relationship with the folks who produce the series &ndash; decided to bow out of the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; world earlier this year, giving the writers a chance to prepare a proper farewell to an important character. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Fox resurfaces some time in the future but, at least for now, her days as a regular are over.</p>

<p>Sara, Gil Grissom&rsquo;s (Will Petersen) protege-turned-lover, exits in a particularly moody and quite good episode that resurrects a troubling old case (remember the manipulative and creepy child genius-murderer Hannah West from last season? Well, she&rsquo;s back.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a proper send-off and one you shouldn&rsquo;t miss if you&rsquo;re a fan of the show.</p>

		<p><strong>The TV hit series CSI will lose Jorja Fox as one of their starring actors.</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle on &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; is leaving the show to pursue other opportunities. Fox has been on the show since it premiered in 2000.</p>

<p>Fox first broke the news in October that she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities before she gets too old.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. Even so, whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves CSI&rsquo;s Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, most fans are happy with the departure. Others feel the production will decline in ratings because of the solid cast behind the popular series.</p>

<p>CSI fans are split, some have called the character pathetic and that Fox is too dramatic that whines all the time. Others feel the show will suffer because Fox is good to look at.</p>

<p>While Jorja Fox is no George Clooney, she may be weighing on something much bigger than CSI. There could be a movie in the works and leaving CSI doesn&rsquo;t mean the sudden end to her successful career. Tom Hanks was recognized on a TV series before making impressive movies. That was a good career move.</p>

<p>Fox is a good actor, she&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox&rsquo;s character valuable to show, and she&rsquo;s a role model, readers say</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for actors to leave a successful show after a long run to pursue other opportunities. George Clooney did so successfully. But whether or not Jorja Fox can pull off the same feat when she leaves âCSI&rsquo;s&rsquo; Sara Sidle behind is of little worry for fans of the hit crime drama &ndash; they&rsquo;re more concerned that the show will suffer without her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason âCSI&rsquo; is great is because of the cast. Any one of their departure would affect the strength of the show,&rdquo; explained Matt from Alameda, Calif. &ldquo;Sara Sidle is vital to âCSI.&rsquo; She brings humanity to the show, she always has. The cases in âCSI: Vegas,&rsquo; âMiami,&rsquo; âNew York&rsquo; &hellip; and oh so many crime shows are very similar, but âCSI: Vegas&rsquo; as a show is different because they have a great chemistry among characters. A big chuck of it will be gone with Sara&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;(The show) will be worse. She&rsquo;s the only one that seems like a genuine investigator or criminalist, apparently the romance between her and Grissom became their biggest ratings grabber (they&rsquo;re kinda cute anyway, so whatever, and we all know that when an important member of the cast leaves a show, the show is doomed, especially now that they&rsquo;ve started lacking in the &ldquo;case&rdquo; department). And she&rsquo;s nice to look at, too,&rdquo; said Angel from Pembroke Pines, Fla.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>I think it will be worse off. The character, besides being a good, if troubled role model was often the voice of humanity on the show. Grissom is portrayed as rather lacking in feeling and Willows is often shown as an oversexed woman who at times lacks discretion and good judgment. I wish Jorja Fox the best in what ever she goes on to do, but I hope that the writers at &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; don&rsquo;t think that the fans will be placated by the doe-y eyed Ronnie who seems as bright as a burnt-out bulb. It was nice to see a woman in science who didn&rsquo;t wear all white to a crime scene or heels to check out blood spatter. I hope they find a like-minded person to replace her or somehow entice her back to the show. <strong>&ndash;S.H., Wash.</strong></p>

<p>The show will not be the same without Jorja Fox and her character of Sara Sidle. Sara Sidle is probably the most complex and emotive character on the show. Jorja&rsquo;s immense talent makes it so easy for the viewers to sympathize with the character, and I fear that without her the show will lose its heart and become a cold rock of boredom and mediocrity. <strong>&ndash;Joe, Irvine, Calif.</strong></p>

<p>I am very saddened by Ms. Fox&rsquo;s decision to leave &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; She brings a humanity and grace to Sara that will be definitely lacking when she&rsquo;s gone. The heart of the show will be gone. Ms. Fox is an incredible actress. She and William Petersen share a chemistry that is not seen anywhere on television and they can say more with just a look than pages of dialogue ever could. If ever there were two characters that were destined to be together forever, it is Grissom and Sara. I wish Ms. Fox all the best in life and look forward to her return to &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; as Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar have told us WILL happen. <strong>&ndash;Marti</strong></p>

<p>Sara gave the show a realness. She is not as important as Grissom but she gave the team a good attitude. If Ronnie is suppose to be the new Sara, that sucks. Ronnie can&rsquo;t compare. I think it will change the show, I don&rsquo;t think better or worse just different. She had an attitude that added to the team. Each character added something and when you take away a part of the team it takes away from the strong feel of the show. <strong>&ndash;MF, Penn.</strong></p>

<p>I believe that the show will deplete without Sara Sidle. She adds realism, human compassion and laughter with her character. She will be totally missed and I hope she returns. Without Sara there is no Grissom. She makes Grissom human. <strong>&ndash;Maria, Mississauga, Ontario</strong></p>

<p>I have no intention to continue watching after Sara leaves. Actually I could accept that Sara was leaving to find a new job in Vegas, but the emotional breakdown that we are likely to see as her finale irritates me. I don&rsquo;t want to see a &ldquo;Dear Grissom&rdquo; letter or Sara fall to pieces. Sara deserves a happy ending, not a depressing, open-ended farewell. GSR is what has kept me watching this show, and now that one half is gone, it won&rsquo;t be the same for me. Everyone that wants to keep watching the procedural aspects of this show, good luck and enjoy. Farewell, &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; <strong>&ndash;AK Wagner</strong></p>

<p>No! Sara Sidle is a brilliant and important female figure on TV. Unlike so many other females on screen she doesn&rsquo;t show of her &#8216;assets&rsquo; to gain attention nor is she like the plethora of vapid girls who have no identifable talent. Sara Sidle is an smart woman, graduating high school at 16 and financing her own way through Havard. She, like many, is socially akward and this means that thousands (even millions) of bright and shy girls (and boys) have a figure on TV with whom they can identify. Jorja Fox herself is an excellent role model who holds strong beliefs about animal cruelty, politics and prejudice. Why so many people seem to hate her is beyond me. It is a pity we are losing her from our screens especially as this nation becomes more obsessed with the fame and drug-crazed antics of people with significantly less talent. &ndash;Amy, Orlando, Fla.</p>

<p>Sara is the best female character on TV today. She&rsquo;s an intelligent, real woman with issues that define how she reacts to situations but not who she is. Sara&rsquo;s departure will leave a hole that is impossible to fill. I doubt &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; will continue to be as popular as it is. <strong>&ndash;Anonymous</strong></p>

<p>The entire cast of CSI is important to the success of the show. Sara will definitely be missed as she adds so much that none of the other characters can offer. For those of us who like strong female role models that want to be taken seriously, she is the only person to relate to on the show. Catherine&rsquo;s sexuality and cleavage may have their place and I like her as well, but Sara adds balance. She&rsquo;s outspoken, strong, intelligent, relentless, and kind. She&rsquo;s a real woman (so to speak, I know she&rsquo;s a character) who actually succeeds in being taken seriously in a man&rsquo;s world. As a woman who couldn&rsquo;t find her feminine wiles if they slapped me in the face, I appreciate a woman who can be one of the boys. While I respect Jorja&rsquo;s decision to leave, she will certainly be missed. <strong>&ndash;Chelsea, Champaign, Ill.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Readers dish on why Jorja Fox&rsquo;s departure from &lsquo;CSI&rsquo; should be celebrated</strong></p>

<p>In October, Jorja Fox, who has played Sara Sidle on &lsquo;CSI&rsquo; since the show premiered in 2000, told EW.com she would be leaving the hit crime drama to explore other opportunities &ldquo;before (she) gets too old.&rdquo; We asked readers to weigh in on her departure, and while some fans were upset over the seemingly definite demise of GSR, others were practically jubilant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for it to happen,&rdquo; wrote Bob from Lewiston, N.Y. &ldquo;The pathetic character she played had no screen presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;YES! YES! YES!&rdquo; exclaimed Michelle of Smithville, Tenn. &ldquo;She is so overdramatic and whines so much about everything! They should have kept her dead when they had the chance. That would have been good TV and she would have left a martyr. Shows that kill off one of their main stars always have a revitalized audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>I never really cared for Sara in the first place, so I have to say the show will be better. She&rsquo;s too hard to identify with and seems to have no personality whatsoever. Anybody who replaces her has got to be better. BTW, was that a baby bump I saw or just an ill-fitting shirt? <strong>&ndash;Mary, Norton, Kan.</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be either worse or better, just different. I really got creeped out thinking about her relationship with Grissom, though, so I guess I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s gone. Usually when two of the characters hook up, the show goes down the tubes. Look at &ldquo;moonlighting&rdquo; for an example. With the &ldquo;X-Files&rdquo; it was partially the tension between Scully and Mulder that kept the show interesting; it was really getting weird toward the end. <strong>&ndash;Sue, Brunswick, Md.</strong></p>

<p>Sara Sidle is a cold, bitter, toxic, unfriendly character who does not generate one sliver of empathy or familiarity with the viewer. I want her to go so that someone else (anyone else) can get a chance to connect with the viewers. Grissom needs to get it on with Lady Heather. <strong>&ndash;Leona, Sarasota, Fla.</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that her departure will make a difference one way or the other. I like the idea of Grissom having a love interest, but I never felt he and Sara had any chemistry. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just Jorja Fox playing his love interest. I just don&rsquo;t buy it. <strong>&ndash;Kerri</strong></p>

<p>I never really cared for Sara in the first place, so I have to say the show will be better. She&rsquo;s too hard to identify with and seems to have no personality whatsoever. Anybody who replaces her has got to be better. <strong>&ndash;Mary, Norton, Kan.</strong></p>

<p>While I have nothing against Jorja Fox, I strongly dislike her character and I am looking forward to her departure. I believe the show will be improved drastically because of her departure, because the writers will no longer try to cram 30 seconds of Grissom/Sara &ldquo;romance&rdquo; into the show when those 30 seconds could be used to make the episodes intelligent and thought-provoking. Because of the Grissom/Sara pairing, the show has been reduced to a mindless, teen soap opera. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day when the show is returned to its former glory, without Sara Sidle being there to irritate me. <strong>&ndash;Linda, Ore.</strong></p>

<p>I think &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; will be better without Sara. I like Sara, I really do. However, I do not like the Grissom-Sara relationship. It seems that this relationship has taken over the show and it has become the Grissom-Sara show. With Sara gone, GSR will be a memory. Perhaps, maybe &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; will get back to the business of solving crimes rather than worrying about who&rsquo;s with who. <strong>&ndash;Nicole</strong></p>

<p>It will be much better. Her character was ill-conceived for a CSI professional and was often extremely irritating. Her supposed empathy came off as emotional instability and her feistiness seemed more like passive-aggressive grandstanding. A personality like that would be poisonous in a workplace, but instead she got the big romantic buildup along with a lot of backstory that was just a plea for us to sympathize with her. It was a total failure. And forget the disgusting secret office romance with her long-time father-figure crush. Please let Grissom&rsquo;s character have a renaissance now that this albatross is not around his neck. <strong>&ndash;TR, New Jersey</strong></p>

<p>Better, much better. I don&rsquo;t like to see professional relationships turn into romantic slush on a TV series, and I am very happy that we won&rsquo;t have to watch that happen on &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; Fox&rsquo;s voice also annoyed me no end &ndash; whiny, and full of Valley Girl inflections (every sentence ending on a rising note, as if it were a question). I&rsquo;m so happy she&rsquo;s gone. I just hope she stays gone. I&rsquo;ve read some TV gossip that says she might return. <strong>&ndash;Bonnie, Ocean Springs, Miss.</strong></p>

<p>Yay! Until this season, Sara never really bothered me, but for some reason, she is really grating on my nerves now and I&rsquo;m glad she is going. The whole relationship with Grissom was just plain icky! <strong>&ndash;Liz, Milwaukee, Wis.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has a strong cast and can withstand the loss of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). I&rsquo;ve grown weary of her perma-sulk as she mopes through the department, voluntarily isolating herself, then staring longingly at everyone as they seem to gel around her. She comes off as a brilliant scientist with the social skills of a 7th grader with the way she scowls with jealousy at any female within 10 feet of Grissom that isn&rsquo;t Catherine and scowls at anyone who looks at Catherine more than at her. I&rsquo;m over it &ndash; and her. Time to move on. <strong>&ndash;Karen, Wisconsin</strong></p>
