		<p><strong>Pizza to die for</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox sees dead people - but that&rsquo;s her job. As forensic crime scene investigator Sara Sidle on CSI, she determines the cause of death by examining evidence with high-tech toys. Forensic science allows the dead to communicate with the living and producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made it chic to be a science geek.</p>

<p>What viewer see each week, such as the path of a bullet travelling through a human body could put anyone off eating meat. Maybe we should take a tip from Fox and become vegetarians, which she&rsquo;s been for over 15 years.</p>

<p>And her favorite dish? &ldquo;Pizza, Always pizza. I think I&rsquo;ve been a pizza fanatic my whole life. It started in New York city, cause you could get dough from a lot of pizza shops there&rdquo;, says Fox.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need to knead, however, when you can beg, borrow or deal to your hands on the dough. &ldquo;I actually get the crust from one of my favorite pizza joints in L.A&hellip;. they sell it to me in a little ball&rdquo;, the actress says.</p>

<p>Fox takes her goods home where she employs simple cooking method to devour the evidence. &ldquo;[Because] I&rsquo;m a vegetarian, I make [my pizza] with soy pepperoni and sausage, and soy cheese, Cilantro and pineapple is my favorite, with a little veggie sausage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But be careful - that combination could be used as a lethal weapon.</p>

<p>Vegetarian Pizza with Pineapple and Pepperoni</p>

<p>1 12 inch (30 cm) pizza round</p>

<p>1 cup/250 ml pizza sauce or salsa</p>

<p>2 cups/500 ml pineapple tidbits, fresh or canned, well drained</p>

<p>1 pkg (4.2 oz/120 g sliced soy pepperoni, or amount to taste</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup /50 ml fresh cilantro, chopped</p>

<p>2 cups/500 ml soy cheese, shredded</p>

<p>Fox prefers to buy the pizza dough from her favorite pizza shop and sometimes uses soy sausage instead of soy pepperoni. Pour pizza sauce over pizza round and spread evenly. Arrange pineapple and pepperoni slices to taste on and sprinkle with cilantro and shredded cheese. Bake in the lower half of a 450 F (230 C) oven for 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Makes 1 12-inch (30 cm) pizza.</p>

		<p><strong>vegetarian girl next door catapults to stardom</strong></p>

<p>As a star on the top-rated CBS police drama <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, Jorja (pronounced Georgia) Fox as to watch what she eats. Not or health reasons- although nutrition certainly is important to the devoted vegetarian- but becuase of the show&rsquo;s sometimes gory realism. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned not to eat before certain scenes,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s hardly surprising give the fact that Fox&rsquo;s character, Sara Sidle- a name that, she says, &ldquo;sounds a little too much like &lsquo;suicidal&rsquo;&rdquo;- works as a member of the CSI autopsy team. Her job? Examining the lifeless bodies discovered in the dark hours of the night in Las Vegas and uncovering clues about the who, what, where, when and why of their demise.</p>

<p>Sidle is just the latest in a string of serious, determined characters that fox has portrayed on the big and small screens. She joined the cast of <em>ER</em> in its third season as the gun-toting, vegetarian, gay resident, Dr. Maggie Doyle- &ldquo;No meat. No men. I&rsquo;m your woman.&rdquo; She appeared in <em>The West Wing</em> as special agent Gina Toscano, the dedicated secret service protector of the president&rsquo;s daughter. And in her most recent film, the critically acclaimed <em>Memento</em>, she played the murder victim, a role that entailed lying for hours on a bathroom floor, wet, covered by a shower curtain.</p>

<p>By following Fox&rsquo;s career, you might assume you know a thing or two about her from the characters she&rsquo;s played. You know the look: the tall, lithe brunette with the slight space between her front teeth. You recognize the voice: a hint of the tomboy all grown up. You feel the persona: girl always up for a wind-in-her-hair kind of adventure, followed maybe by a pizza and beed. And, yes, she is both an animal lover and a vegetarian, a detail that has been written into some of the characters she protrays.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Jorja Fox, it&rsquo;s true. But the person behind the role is someone else again- a distinct character with a storyline all her own.</p>

<p><strong>model citizen</strong></p>

<p>A New Your City native, Fox spent most of her childhood in Melbourne Beach, Florida, on a barrier island with the ocean on one side and a river on the other. &ldquo;My life was all about water- sailing, water-skiing, swimming, surfing. It&rsquo;s where I developed my passion for being outside. It was simply a wonderful place to be a kid. I grew up barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The family- which includes an older brother- had moved south to fulfull Fox&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s dream of living in a beach town. But they were a restless group, changing residences often and taking frequent trips to New York City and Canada, where Fox&rsquo;s parents hail from.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it was in Flordia that Fox met her destiny, winning by a fluke, she says, a modeling contest she entered as a joke. &ldquo;I was very, very, very shocked to win,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was a fish out of water becuase I wasn&rsquo;t a classic beauty. In Florida, beauty was all about being blond and tan. I&rsquo;m a tall, gangly, dark-haired Irish girl. I just didn&rsquo;t fit the bill.&rdquo; But her beauty was recognized nevertheless, and at 15 she won the oppertunity to live in New York City and give modeling a try.</p>

<p>After a summer spent living with another teenage model and a chaperone, Fox decided there was no going back. She opted to stay in New York, finish high school and pursue modeling. Her career focused primarily on print media- magazines in particular. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too short for runway work,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I only worked the runway when someone else called in sick.&rdquo; Another impediment to success on the catwalk? The once-barefoot girl &ldquo;could barely walk in heels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From New York she went to Europe, where, she says, she felt &ldquo;fearless.&rdquo; Those years of modeling and traveling throughout Europe with peers were &ldquo;fantastic, a wilder dream than I ever could have imagined,&rdquo; she says. After a time, however, Fox decided that modeling had its limitations.</p>

<p>Returning to New York at 18, she turned her attention to acting, focusing on studying and auditioning. She adopted an eclectic approach to supporting herself: working at a kennel, as a temp and even as a coat checker in a downtown nightclub.</p>

<p>But her fast-paced city lifestyle never diminished her love of the outdoors, and she continued to run for exercise and bike just to get places she needed to go. &ldquo;I rode everwhere. It just seemed like a normal thing to do. Besides, I was broke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along the way, Fox began to examine the way she&rsquo;d been eating. A lifelong meat-and-potatoes lover, she constantly peppered her vegetarian friends with questions about their dietary habits. Then one day in Brooklyn- in the midst of consuming a meatball sub- she had an epiphany. &ldquo;I just got it. I made a connection. I started reading voraciously about vegetarianism, and got ready for the questions from others, like the ones I&rsquo;d asked my friends.&rdquo; Fifteen years later, Fox says eating a meat-free diet is just something she does without questioning.</p>

<p><strong>sweet success</strong></p>

<p>At age 19, Fox got her first movie role in <em>The Kill-Off</em>, a dark and disturbing independant film that was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. And soon after, other roles started coming her way. &ldquo;By age 25, I knew I could make a living as an actor,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>At 34, she has ample proof that she was right. Her resume includes stints on the best and brightest of what&rsquo;s on the small screen. in addition to her roles on <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>, Fox has also appeared on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, the &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; episode of <em>Ellen</em>, and in such films as <em>The Jerky Boys</em>, <em>Dead Funny</em> and <em>The Hungry Bachelor&rsquo;s Club</em>.</p>

<p>Now, Fox throws herself into the role as the work-obsessed, relationship-impaired Sidle, a hard-nosed scientist raised by two ex-hippies in rural Northern California. According to her character sketch, Fox&rsquo;s current alter ego &ldquo;can solve any problem except how she&rsquo;s supposed to relate to others.&rdquo; Her character plunges into her work becuase she&rsquo;s afraid of what she&rsquo;d have to face if she slowed down. She pursues the mysteries of death because those of life are more discomforting.</p>

<p>Fox&rsquo;s own character sketch would read quite differently. She&rsquo;s devoted to work and life in equal measure, and has no trouble connecting with myriad living, breathing creatures. She exudes energy, enthusiasm and, in contrast to her serious television demeanor, a light-hearted, let&rsquo;s-have-some-fun approach to life. Her passions are many- being outdoors, getting in her car and heading out on the open road, surfing, live music, spending time with friends and the company on her animals- two cats rescued from shelters, and one dog, a boxer aptly named Ali.</p>

<p>To keep up with all of her interests, coupled with <em>CSI</em>&rsquo;s grueling schedule- few weeks and often unpredictable hours- Fox needs endurance. When she&rsquo;s filming, she may put in five long weekdays plus Saturday, either on the set north of Los Angeles or on location in Las Vegas. Each workday can last anywhere from six to fifteen hours; her starting and quitting times vary greatly. &ldquo;Sometimes filming starts at 7 a.m., other days it starts at 6 p.m. One day I may be done at 5:30 p.m., other days 5:30 a.m. A lot of times I don&rsquo;t know in advance,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p><strong>health matters</strong></p>

<p>Given the demands of starring in a weekly television series, Fox has to be prepared for anything- and she is: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m adaptable. I like the flexability.&rdquo; Not one to adhere to a rigid routine, she has learned that she needs to respect her internal rhythms to keep up her stamina. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned to sleep when I&rsquo;m tired and eat when I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing she isn&rsquo;t flexible about, however, is her healthy diet. Although Fox was a vegan for six months when she lived in Chicago, that lifestyle is more difficult to adhere to lately. &ldquo;I work so much that I depend on others to cook for me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t eat much dairy, just a little cream in my tea, but I eat tons of eggs, now that they have cage-free organic ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the benefits of a vegetarian diet: &ldquo;I noticed that during the first five years of being a vegetarian, I felt much lighter, although I only dropped three or four pounds. I liked that lightness,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>But Fox&rsquo;s healthy habits go far beyond diet. She is, she says, a faithful reader of <em>Better Nutrition</em>, and she takes her own health very seriously. She&rsquo;s always careful to boost her immune system, particularly during the filming season. &ldquo;I take a decent amnount of supplements- a B complex, a mineral complex, digestive enzymes, astragalus and vitamin C. I don&rsquo;t want to get run-down,&rdquo; which is bound to happen with the schedule she keeps and the close quarters in which she works. &ldquo;The cramped stages don&rsquo;t have a tremendous amount of ventilation,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being at school and one kid shows up with a cold, and you just know everyone is going to get it. Same thing on the set. I hear someone sneeze and I say, &lsquo;Oh, here we go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also exercises when she can. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a gym person,&rdquo; she says. So when she works out- every other weekday and twice on weekends- she does it either in the fresh air of the privacy of her home. &ldquo;I put on a CD and dance for 45 minutes,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Her favorite workout partner is Ali, the boxer, who&rsquo;s always up for a run whenever she is, which more than likely is late in the evening. While the two of them often go for a run at 10 p.m., after working, you&rsquo;ll never see them out before the sun rises. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a morning person,&rdquo; says Fox, &ldquo;I wake up slowly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>on the go</strong></p>

<p>Despite the struggle to get out of bed each morning, Fox unfailingly shows up to breathe life into Sidle, a key player on the CSI autopsy team and a role that Fox embodies with pleasure. &ldquo;I love my character,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so smart. She&rsquo;s at the top of her game. Every day is a learning experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox is self-deprecating when comparing herself to the character she plays, denying that she&rsquo;s as smart as Sidle, who has a B.S. in physics from Harvard and did graduate work in theoretical physics. &ldquo;I just love being able to say that,&rdquo; she says. Unlike her alter ego, Fox claims that she has finite space in her short-term memory. &ldquo;As an actor,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t retain a tremendous amount. I do six scenes a day, and there&rsquo;s not that much room in my memory for more. I learn the lines, then I clear them out and learn others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, in fact, she has learned more that she lets on. After all, it takes skill to appear believable when conducting a dramatic rendition of an autopsy.</p>

<p>Having lived on both coasts, Fox is pleased with the peripateic life she leads. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit gypsy-ish.&rdquo; As long as she can be outside- at the beach, hiking- she&rsquo;s happy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I love running; you can do it anywhere. It travels well.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s also a dedicated surper, riding the ways several times a month, more during hiatus from her show.</p>

<p>During her infrequent breaks from fliming <em>CSI</em>, Fox devotes hersel to Honeypot Productions, a small acting troupe that she co-founded. This is where she truly expresses herself, she says, by writing for and acting in live threater. So far Honeypot has staged five different shows, two of them written by Fox and all of them performed outdoors. &ldquo;We put on plays that no one would pay us to do. We stage them in friends&rsquo; backyards.&rdquo; She stops to laugh. &ldquo;No one has volunteered a yard for next season, but I think there&rsquo;s one person who just might be willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Fox&rsquo;s skyrocketing career is any indication, those backyard plays are sure to launch into Broadway productions. Stay tuned.</p>

		<p>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation stars Jorja Fox and Gary Dourdan have become best friends after the actor delayed a promotional trip to Europe to wait for his sick pal. Fox claims the cast of the hit show have been close from the beginning, but when Dourdan gave up his dream trip to Europe to help nurse the actress back to full health when she caught the flu, she knew that he was extra special.</p>

<p>She says, &ldquo;I got really sick. I thought maybe I should cancel the trip, but Gary waited for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We took a later flight and he practically carried me to Europe.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><em>Gruesome but gripping &#8212; that&rsquo;s CSI, the US crime series that&rsquo;s gained quiet a reputation</em></p>

<p>If you were asked to name the most successful American TV show, you&rsquo;d probably think of <em>Friends</em>, <em>ER</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em>, or <em>Sex and the City</em>. In fact, it&rsquo;s none of those &#8212; it&rsquo;s actually <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, which has taken America by storm and is winning plenty of fans here too.</p>

<p>Returning for a third season this week, it&rsquo;s a crime drama with a difference &#8212; with forensic science being the star of the show, rather than the actors. Gruesome crime scenes and decomposing corpses mean it&rsquo;s not for the faint-hearted, but the gadgets and techniques unsed to nail the bad guys &#8212; when they&rsquo;ve only got a shoelace or insect bite to go on &#8212; draw you in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We go into so much detail that viewers feel they&rsquo;re solving the crime with us. It sure makes me feel smart,&rdquo; says former <em>ER</em> star Jorja Fox, who plays forensic investigator Sara Sidle, alongside William Petersen as teal leader Gil Grissom and Marg Helgenberger as Catherine Willows.</p>

<p>Hollywood superstars Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson are both huge fans and, since Five began showing <em>CSI</em> just over a year-and-a-half-ago, it has become the channel&rsquo;s highest-rated drama series, regularly pulling in two million viewers.</p>

<p>The series is produced by hard-hitting Hollywood veteran Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind films such as <em>Armageddon</em>. The new series opens with the team investigating a drag racer&rsquo;s death. If you&rsquo;re squeamish, be warned &#8212; they find the body after the vultures. But as Jorja says: &ldquo;A lot of the storylies are based on read-life studies&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Lead roles in ER and CSI have made Jorja Fox one of the most envied actresses in Hollywood.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why Jorja Fox particularly enjoys her job &#8212; and they all involve staring opposite Hollywood hunks. First there was George Clooney, then Rob Lowe and now there&rsquo;s Gary Dourdan. &ldquo;Believe me, there&rsquo;s no such thing as a bad day when you&rsquo;re going to work with those guys,&rdquo; she laughs.</p>

<p>After playing Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, and Special Agent Gina Toscano in The West Wing, Jorja is now the ambitious forensic investigator Sara Sidle, in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. With the show knocking both Friends and ER off the ratings&rsquo; top spot in America, it means that she has starred in three of the biggest US TV hits of the last decade. And most importantly, she&rsquo;s had gorgeous co-stars in all of them. CSI&rsquo;s Gary Dourdan, who plays Warrick Brown, was in a recent poll of the 50 sexiest men in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, I&rsquo;m a lucky girl,&rdquo; she grins. &ldquo;Gary is totally drop-dead gorgeous. Even now, two-and-a-half years into making the show, we&rsquo;ll be doing a scene and I&rsquo;ll look him in the eye and go to pieces. But,&rdquo; she shrugs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had crushes on most of the guys I&rsquo;ve worked with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s disarming to hear an actress confess so freely &#8212; a Hollywood actress at that. But while Jorja, 34, may be a hot name, she&rsquo;s just one of the girls. and up for a good gossip. Forget bottled water, she swigs a beer and smokes a cigarette, her legs up on the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crushes&rdquo; on your co-stars?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve had serious crushes on a couple,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve told them. But it&rsquo;s difficult to go for it if you&rsquo;re going to be working togeather for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her co-stars (even with their looks) would have a job pinning Jorja down anyway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keen on being settled,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;Even though I liked the idea of true love, I can&rsquo;t completely believe in the idea of being with the same person for my entire life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s also of two minds about having children. &ldquo;Theoretically, I&rsquo;m maternal,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But not while I&rsquo;m working the way I am. Anyway, they say 50 is the new 30. Our generation&rsquo;s taking a little longer to grow up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Born in New York, Jorja moved with her parents, Edward and Marilyn, to Florida when she was three. She grew up in Melbourne Beach, surfing and going by the nickname of Foxy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a chubby kid with buckteeth &#8212; i could fit a quarter between my two front teeth,&rdquo; she smiles. &ldquo;Still, my mum went out and got Foxy Girl T-shirts for me to wear. I was not foxy at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even so, she was &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; at a model-search competition and spent her late teens on the catwalks of Europe. But determined to act, she worked in bars, as a waitress, in kennels and got TV bit parts until landing the role of Maggie Doyle in the third series of ER. She moved on to do The West Wing, starred in the film Memento with Guy Pearce, and then CSI came up.</p>

<p>With over 23 million American viewers, CSI is building an impressive fan base here too, and is the highest-rated drama on Five. Kings of cool Samuel L. Jackson, Quentin Tarintino and Kevin Spacey all reckon it&rsquo;s their favourite show. &ldquo;CSI feels special becuase I was in it from the start, when no one knew if it would take off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With stories of decomposing corpses and bodies attacked by vultures, the subject matter is not for the squeamish. It&rsquo;s also hard for Jorja given that she lost her mum six years ago, aged 69, to ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Losing her and being in CSI has made me think there&rsquo;s a very thin veil between life and death,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m such an optimist. I don&rsquo;t worry about the future becuase it wastes the time you&rsquo;re in. I&rsquo;d much rather be in the moment, enjoy each day, and do things that make me feel good. I&rsquo;ve got a lot to be happy about.&rdquo;</p>
