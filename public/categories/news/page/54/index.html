		<p>When last we saw actress Jorja Fox on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, her alter ego Sara Sidle was deep in the Costa Rican jungle, happily reunited with the love of her life, Gil Grissom. Well, apparently Sara&rsquo;s going to have some very good reason to leave that romantic idyll because come this fall, Jorja Fox is returning to &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; for five episodes.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no indication that William Petersen&rsquo;s Gil is joining her, although since Petersen is still connected to the show as an executive producer, he could decide to pop in for a show or two.</p>

<p>With the ratings slipping a bit in key demographics since Petersen&rsquo;s exit in January 2009, the return of Jorja might be the kind of jolt the venerable crime drama needs to kick up the viewership. Laurence Fishburne has settled in as Dr. Raymond Langston, but the novelty of the new guy has worn off and bringing Sara back couldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>After all the push and pull between Fox and &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, her contract dispute in 2004, her announcing that she was leaving in 2007, it&rsquo;s kind of funny to read how thrilled &ldquo;CSI**s executive producer Carol Mendelsohn is about Jorja&rsquo;s return. She did let on that the Sidle character will be back in Las Vegas in the premiere episode. That&rsquo;s Thursday, September 24. Mark it in your calender. No, seriously. I mean it. I&rsquo;ve sort of drifted away from &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; myself. I&rsquo;m curious enough about Jorja Fox&rsquo;s return that I&rsquo;ll tune in that night.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been two years since Jorja Fox left the grimy Las Vegas crime scenes of &#8216;CSI&rsquo; for sun, surf and soul searching. But now she&rsquo;s set to return as Sara Sidle for a much anticipated five-episode arc on the series&rsquo; 10th season (premiering Sept. 24 on CBS). There&rsquo;s wild speculation around the circumstances of her visit &#8212; Is another CSI in danger? Are Sara and Grissom still together? &#8212; and AOL TV grilled her mercilessly for the juicy details.</p>

<p>In our exclusive interview, Fox, phoning from a hammock on the shores of Santa Monica, was thrilled to dish &#8212; about, among other things, if she&rsquo;ll ever return to &#8216;CSI&rsquo; full time, her reaction to some of George Eads&rsquo; less flattering comments and her outrageous guest spot on &#8216;Drop Dead Diva&rsquo; as a (gasp!) housewife. &#8212; &ldquo;By Sandy Deane&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why exactly does Sara come back to Vegas?</strong></p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;re hoping to reveal a lot of that in the premiere, so I really can&rsquo;t talk too much about it. I think that within the context of the story that &#8216;CSI&rsquo; had a rough year last year. They lost a close friend and a co-worker [in Warrick], and then the character of Grissom decides to go off into the blue yonder. They had two new members of their team, and it was just sort of a hard year for those characters. I think it&rsquo;s true that Grissom and Sara have kept in touch with those guys, and Sara comes back to see if she can help out.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us if Sara and Grissom are still together?</strong></p>

<p>I cannot. That&rsquo;s going to have to be a surprise.</p>

<p><strong>In a poll we ran, 14 percent of the people said that they think something happened to Grissom and that Sara needs the CSI&rsquo;s help.</strong></p>

<p>You know what I love? I love that folks care enough to talk about why Sara&rsquo;s actually returning. Even all along with the Sara-Grissom storyline, there&rsquo;s been a lot of people that really hate it. They hate the storyline, they wish it would go away. But, for me, I like to think it&rsquo;s a compliment that people still care enough to hate it.</p>

<p><strong>Did you seek to return to the show or did the show contact you?</strong></p>

<p>When I left the show two years ago &hellip; the last thing I said to Carol Mendelsohn, the showrunner of &#8216;CSI,&rsquo; was &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to visit!&rdquo; [laughs]. Last year I was there for four shows &#8212; under very sad circumstances for the most part. Gary Dourdan had decided that he was leaving the show &hellip; We all miss him very much and we&rsquo;ll continue to do so. And then I knew, sort of in the back of my head that William Petersen was on his way out and that there was a good chance I would be involved in his exit. So this time around it came as a complete and utter surprise; I had no idea that they&rsquo;d be calling, and I was thrilled. I&rsquo;m having a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Is it just five episodes or is there any chance you&rsquo;re going to hang on for much longer?</strong></p>

<p>What we had set up when I came back was that I would visit for five shows, so that&rsquo;s kind of what we&rsquo;re doing right now. I think everybody&rsquo;s sort of taking things day by day &hellip; I would have to say the premiere episode is truly thrilling and anybody who is a fan will not be disappointed by the season premiere. It blew me away, I read the first page and I was like &ldquo;Oh, my gosh, they&rsquo;ve done it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>So you&rsquo;re not closing the door on a permanent return to &#8216;CSI&rsquo;?</strong></p>

<p>No. I would absolutely never close the door on that, but I do think that now it&rsquo;s set up as a visit.</p>

<p><strong>Have you watched &#8216;CSI&rsquo; since you left?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, and I caught up a bunch. It&rsquo;s sort of more intermittently than I had in the past. I really thought this season was amazing last year. I loved Laurence Fishburne; I loved Lauren Lee Smith. Everybody sort of had a pretty big hurdle to try and overcome last year, and I thought they did a spectacular job with it.</p>

<p><strong>We interviewed George Eads just a few months ago and &hellip; [he said] &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to be here at the end of the day without any divas or attitude.&rdquo; So just curious: What&rsquo;s your relationship with George? And why would he go around calling you a diva?</strong></p>

<p>Well, is there any accident that I&rsquo;m doing &#8216;Drop Dead Diva&rsquo;? Right? [Laughs] I&rsquo;m looking at their cast, and it&rsquo;s a lot of, you know &#8212; diva, first of all, is a compliment, I think, in certain circles &hellip; So there&rsquo;s a compliment in there. I think George didn&rsquo;t quite mean what he said &hellip; Looking back on it, I think he&rsquo;s mentioned it to me more than once that it wasn&rsquo;t sort of what he meant to say, which happens to George a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Wait, did you guys talk about this?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the only thing I would say to you about it in regards to George is that it absolutely takes one to know one [laughs]. And he&rsquo;s my brother, and I would walk across fire for him any day. But it takes one to know one.</p>

<p><strong>Did you ever have doubts that the show could sustain its quality after 10 years?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, yeah. Many times. After almost every season I would think [that] &#8212; because it really does get harder. I think the bulk of that stress and pressure falls on the writers&rsquo; room. But as I mentioned, that when I read the first page of the first episode of season 10, I was like &ldquo;OK, they&rsquo;re on it! Game on!&rdquo; They blew me away. And I had had that thought when I was looking at coming back. I was like, &ldquo;Wow, has this ship sailed?&rdquo; You know, just it&rsquo;s sort of inevitable, not because of anybody&rsquo;s lack of talent &hellip; I just heard on NPR that &#8216;Law &amp; Order&rsquo; is starting its 20th season, and that&rsquo;s amazing! And that show is as fresh as it&rsquo;s ever been &hellip; The fans tune in loyally to something that they know they already love; they&rsquo;re not necessarily looking for something too crazily different. But that&rsquo;s certainly a marker for the &#8216;CSI&rsquo; guys to chase.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s next for you?</strong></p>

<p>I was excited to go back to work. I had taken really almost a year off, and I thought about maybe even changing careers &hellip; And having the time off and traveling, I realized I love what I do &hellip; I&rsquo;d love to do some theater; I&rsquo;d love to do some film; I will continue to do TV if they will have me. I&rsquo;m really excited about &#8216;Drop Dead Diva&rsquo; on Sun., Aug. 16. That was a 180-degree departure for me, and kind of scary.</p>

<p><strong>What made you sign on?</strong></p>

<p>I love Lifetime; I&rsquo;m a fan. Josh Berman is the exec producer of the show, and he and I had worked together for five years on &#8216;CSI&rsquo; &hellip; When I got the script, I was like, &ldquo;How are they going to pull this off? This story is just so not based in reality.&rdquo; But then Josh also sent me the pilot episode, and the minute I saw it I was like, &ldquo;Oh, my Gosh! They pulled this off!&rdquo; And Brooke [Elliott] is incredible.</p>

<p><strong>What were the other things you were thinking about doing if you were to leave acting?</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s almost embarrassing. I&rsquo;ve had a very naive passion for politics my whole life, and I thought maybe &#8212; you know, on a small, local level, or a state level, a city level &#8212; that that might be something that I&rsquo;d want to do. I could get into a gazillion different areas of environmentalism and really pursue that as an occupation because that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m really passionate about.</p>

		<p>Following an almost year-long hiatus from the show - which has since suffered from declining ratings - Entertainment Weekly reports Jorja Fox will be returning to &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; later this year to reprise her role as Sara Sidle. According to the crime-drama&rsquo;s executive producer, Carol Mendelsohn, Jorja will &ldquo;reappear&rdquo; in a September 24th episode where viewers will &ldquo;discover where life has taken Sara Sidle and what brings her back to the CSI team in Las Vegas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The announcement comes in the wake of a 5 year battle between Fox and CBS, and just two months after reports that Laurence Fishburne (who replaced series star William Petersen last year) has been unable to connect with loyal viewers. In 2004, 41 year-old Fox was fired from &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; over a contract dispute, only to be rehired a short time later. In 2007, following rumors she was once again being considered for dismissal, an online forum called &ldquo;Your Tax Dollars At Work&rdquo; began a &ldquo;Save Sara Sidle&rdquo; campaign, in which around $15,000 viewers sent the show&rsquo;s producers $1 each to keep Fox on the show. Fox later told &ldquo;EW&rdquo; she would be leaving the show to get a break &ldquo;from the commitment of a weekly television series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja will be making her &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; return on September 24th during the show&rsquo;s season 10 premiere.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> will be returning to &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; in its upcoming season.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a rocky relationship for Fox and &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, with the actress leaving and returning once before over salary and contract disputes.</p>

<p>Her return will only be temporary, as she&rsquo;s just signed on to star in a handful of episodes for the season. Thus far.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d advise her not to look a gift horse in the mouth this time!</p>

		<p>Bah, we all somehow saw it coming, right? After many years of being on the right side of the law, and one instance of being the victim of those on the other side of the law, Jorja Fox gets to be on that other side of the law. I mean arrested. Yep, she&rsquo;s arrested, but only for television, in her guest role on &ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&rdquo; which aired yesterday.</p>

<p>That detail&rsquo;s been out for quite a while, really, way before her five-episode return to this season of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; was announced. She&rsquo;s a soccer mom with a pretty grim past, apparently, and while I probably would miss the show, it&rsquo;s actually a bit interesting seeing her do just that. But wait a minute. What&rsquo;s exactly with &ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&rdquo; and its penchant for pretty high-profile guests?</p>

<p>In Jorja&rsquo;s case, it was a previous connection. Series creator Josh Berman worked for &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; before, and he came to her with that role. &ldquo;I just love the show,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It reminds me a lot of &ldquo;The Love Boat&rdquo;, which was one of my favorites as a kid. It&rsquo;s funny but always poignant, and I&rsquo;m honored to be a part of all the amazing guest stars they&rsquo;re bringing in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had dreams of doing some type of a romantic comedy for years,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;William Petersen and myself, we drew on that as often as possible, but &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really the right genre for romantic comedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hrmmm. Nonetheless Grissom and Sara still fell in love, eh?</p>

<p>Well, the rest of her interview with the &ldquo;New York Daily News&rdquo; was about her role on season 10 of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, and most of that we already know, but if you&rsquo;ve seen her on &ldquo;Drop Dead Diva&rdquo; last night, you might wanna tell me if she pulled off being a prisoner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into an orange jumpsuit for years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope I pulled it off.&rdquo; Well, did she? Did she?</p>
