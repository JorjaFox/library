One of the more frustrating conflicts with [[Sara Sidle|Sara's Biography]] is that she clearly mentions having an brother. Once. And never again. This conflicts with her official CBS biography, which claims she's an only child; however, events on the show supersede the bio in terms of continuity. In [[Committed]] Sara explains she lived in the Foster Care system, it became possible that her brother was a foster-sibling.

As of the airing of [[#Stealing Home|Stealing Home]], the official answer is &#8216;Foster Brother.'

==[[One-hit Wonder]]==  
: Season 3, Episode Fourteen

In &#8221;'One-hit Wonder&#8221;', Sara tells Grissom she has a brother.

:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' [&#8230;] When I was a kid I was playing hide-and-seek one day and I found this plastic bag under my big brother's bed. I thought it was a bag of dirt so I took it to my mom. Turned out it was his bag of weed. He was grounded for a year.

No age is given on this incident.

==[[No Humans Involved]]==  
: Season 5, Episode Ten

In the end of the episode, Sara looks up &#8221;'THE PEOPLE VS. [[Laura Sidle|LAURA SIDLE]] W/2; MODESTO, CALIFORNIA, 1984&#8221;' in [http://www.lexis.com/ LexisNexis]. However, no one knows what it actually means, and it could be in reference to the following, but not limited to:  
* A child custody case  
* A trial where in Laura is being charged with a crime

==[[Nesting Dolls]]==  
: Season 5, Episode Thirteen

There is no mention of a brother when Sara tells Grissom about the murder itself. 

:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' It's funny &#8230; the things that you remember and the things that you don't, you know. There was a smell of iron in the air. Cast-off on the bedroom wall. There was this young cop puking his guts. I remember the woman who took me to foster care. I can't remember her name. Which is strange, you know, 'cause I couldn't let go of her hand.  
:&#8221;'Grissom:&#8221;' Well &#8230; the mind has its filters.  
:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' I do remember the looks. I became the girl whose father was stabbed to death. Do you think there's a murder gene?  
:&#8221;'Grissom:&#8221;' I don't believe that genes are a predictor of violent behavior.  
:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' You wouldn't know that in my house. The fights, the yelling, the trips to the hospital. I thought it was the way that everybody lived. When my mother killed my father, I found out that it wasn't.

==[[Committed]]==  
: Season 5, Episode Twenty-One

Later, when Sara tells Grissom about her mother being committed, she never mentions a brother.

:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for a while for evaluation. It looked the same, it smelled the same. It smelled like lies.  
:&#8221;'Grissom:&#8221;' You sure you're okay?  
:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' Crazy people do make me feel crazy.  
:&#8221;'Grissom:&#8221;' If you want, I can have somebody take your place.  
:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' I appreciate that. I do, I really do, but &#8230; [&#8230;] I kind of made a decision to move beyond that and &#8230; I really want to finish this case.

==[[Stealing Home]]==  
: Season 12, Episode Fifteen

While watching twin brothers and their sister fight over a house, Sara confides to Nick:

:&#8221;'Sidle:&#8221;' Siblings like that kinda make me glad I'm an only child.

When pressed, the writers said:

> #CSI Co-Executive Producer Melissa Byer explains the Sara info from last night: &#8220;The reference from &#8220;One hit wonder&#8221; came before Sara revealed to anyone that she was raised in foster care (Nesting Dolls). Therefore you are right, she was referring to her foster brother.&#8221;
