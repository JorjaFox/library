		<p>Who better than Eric Szmanda of the #1 television drama C.S.I. to investigate his beautiful co-star Jorja Fox? Eric says that when filming wraps for the summer he plans on &ldquo;travelling to Europe and hitting the film festivals&rdquo;. May we suggest a less violent approach, say a handshake, when arriving in Berlin?</p>

<p><em>Jorja Fox, actor interviewed by Eric Szmanda</em></p>

<p><strong>Eric Szmanda:</strong> Has working on CSI changed your outlook on life?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, last night when I cooked dinner for myself in my toaster-oven, I sat down and watched NOVA. [laughter] I sat right down and picked that station. They were having this great show on black holes and stars in the galaxy, and I don&rsquo;t know why, of all the channels, I thought maybe I&rsquo;ll watch NOVA tonight.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> You feel this obligation to study up.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I was always into true crime. It was always about the psychological aspects, the thin line that people walk, you know. What makes somebody go one way and somebody go another? And how two people can have the same sort of family situation and one becomes a violent mind and the other becomes a great writer. Forensic psychology is an area of the show that I wish we had more of because it fascinates me so much. I miss it and we started to do it for a minute and they pulled back on it and decided it was another show. I&rsquo;m also interested in the Sci-Fi and horror genres. So it translated really well.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Nice combination.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I know, even though I had sort of pulled back. I was scared of everything because I was always engulfing myself in scary things. So I needed to cut myself off a little bit and now it&rsquo;s good balances it out a bit better.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How was it working on MEMENTO with Guy Pearce?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Working on MEMENTO was a dream literally. I had no idea what was going on and was too embarrassed to say anything. I found out later nobody knew what was going on. Chris Nolan had three separate story ideas going on in the editing process. It was really fun and a complete surprise from shooting it to even right now. And Guy Pearce was one of my favorite movie husbands. He&rsquo;s totally grounded and sweet. Very wise.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What was that thing in your life that steered you in this direction?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Steered me in the acting direction?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I always wanted to be an actress. Maybe because I grew up in an immigrant family - I have a 99-year-old grandmother - and this idea if the old world and the storytelling. I loved for my mom and my grandmother to sit down at night and tell these stories and they were really good at it. So from a really young age I just loved the idea of storytelling. I had a little TV problem, too. From age 5 to 15.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What were your favorite shows?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, there several over the ages. CHARLIE&rsquo;S ANGEL was a big one. LOST IN SPACE I loved, and THE BIONIC WOMAN.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> All those are just a little bit before my time. Those were all in syndication by the time I was-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, yeah, LOST IN SPACE is old. They were in syndication when I watched them too. MASH, was one of my favorite shows ever. I think I&rsquo;ve seen every MASH ever made.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> It&rsquo;s the MASH anniversary right now.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Is it really?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yeah, I saw Hot Lips on THE TODAY SHOW this morning.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Nice. The show was going on during the Vietnam War, but they called it Korea because they couldn&rsquo;t be that controversial.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> If you weren&rsquo;t doing this what would it be?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Music, which no one ever paid me a cent to do.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Singing?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Guitar probably. Or maybe I&rsquo;d go into politics. Yeah, I have a romance about it. Which is probably all because I&rsquo;ve never done anything in politics. It seems so romantic and cool to me. Everyday doing things that you think you believe in, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s better in thought. What do you think you&rsquo;d be doing?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I&rsquo;d probably still be working in the music business. It&rsquo;s the only other thing I can see myself doing. I think it would have to be some kind of promotion or entertainment of some kind.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It seems to me, I don&rsquo;t know much about the music industry, but it seems that it&rsquo;s always at the insanity level, except for maybe the Motown years. Everything got made right for awhile but it seems like the pendulum has gone to the other side again. A band can have number one singles and still not have any money at all.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> The average member in a rock band makes about the same salary as a 7-11 employee.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Whoa!</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Until your album starts selling millions you don&rsquo;t seeing anything in terms of residuals. So a lot of them just blow their wad way too early and then they are left with nothing, which I have seen happen to a lot of my friends.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> You imagine it&rsquo;s the beginning of your new life, you know. You get this great deal and the money comes in. You get better equipment and a nice van, and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> It still comes out of your budget, which a lot of bands don&rsquo;t realize either. Dirty business, I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re involved in such a dirty business. [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Is there a business that&rsquo;s not dirty though?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I doubt it. I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s all pretty relative. My dad sells medical supplies and there&rsquo;s really no difference in the everyday interaction with clients versus what I was doing when I was trying to sell records. It&rsquo;s all the same, it&rsquo;s just products. Even what we&rsquo;re doing, we are just selling a product.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Absolutely, a very popular product. A product that a lot of people are interested in and they&rsquo;ll spend money on. It&rsquo;s going to be real interesting to see Time/Warner this year with the new CEO. If I ever had a company, I would try to keep as much integrity as I possibly could, and I think they&rsquo;ve done that with so much genius. Or at least compared to a lot of other companies out there. They&rsquo;ve done some pioneering, beautiful things.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> When you got into this acting thing, did you ever think some day you&rsquo;d be seen as a product?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, I think what&rsquo;s so funny about it is that you&rsquo;re lucky if you&rsquo;re seen as a product. That&rsquo;s a lucky thing. Probably from the time I was 16 there started to be an awareness of that, but this really is a business. There is art and there&rsquo;s business and sometimes they get together. Art needs business and business definitely needs art.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How do you deal with it?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I haven&rsquo;t been called on to be a product really. I think I&rsquo;ve been really lucky, It&rsquo;s weird because I was coming from New York City and I had some ideas about LA that weren&rsquo;t very nice. I thought it was a place people came to sell out. That greed is at the base of everything that happens in LA. It was naive of me. Im glad I&rsquo;ve stayed and stuck it out for a while because in LA I&rsquo;ve met more people with more heart and soul than maybe I ever got to meet in New York. How long have you lived here?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Seven years.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Longer than me even.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yes, I spent a year of that in Chicago and six months in Vancouver.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> What year were you in Chicago?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> &lsquo;96-&lsquo;97</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I think I was already in LA. I spent a year in Chicago in 1995.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Doing what?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I did a TV series in Chicago.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What was it?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It was called MISSING PERSONS. We looked for missing people. [laughter] Which is sometimes what we do here on CSI. We didn&rsquo;t have the gadgets at all. Mostly we just talked to people, we did interviews and things like that. We did look for clues sometimes, but it wasn&rsquo;t really the kind of clues we look for now.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How did you like Chicago?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I love Chicago in the summertime, but it was really hard for me to work there in the winter. You are in high heels and it&rsquo;s 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and it&rsquo;s negative 60 degrees. That kind of grueling cold. The camera was frozen and they&rsquo;d have to thaw out the camera. I think it&rsquo;s an amazing city.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Do you think you&rsquo;ll stay here in LA.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever stay anywhere forever. If I want to keep acting there&rsquo;s only really one place that I would want to go. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit acting so I came here. And it&rsquo;s been really good to me. It&rsquo;s been really good to you too.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I&rsquo;d say. No reason to complain. [laughter]</p>

		<p><strong>CSI  the series that makes forensic science look sexy  wraps a very successful second season. Bring on the spinoff and the next victim &hellip;</strong></p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>With the two leads set, casting centered on a trio of supporting characters, a veritable neo<em>Mod Squad</em> of sexy, edgy forensics flunkies. As criminalist Sara Sidle, Jorja Fox, thirty-three, a bohemian type whose backstory includes recurring roles on <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em>, would be the neoPeggy Lipton. Gary Dourdan, thirty-five, a Meisner-trained Philly native who got his start on <em>A Different World</em>, landed the part of sly Warrick Brown; in Pleather jackets, &ldquo;War&rdquo; looks as groovy as Linc. And <em>Savannah&rsquo;s</em> George Eads, also thirty-five and a former public relations major from Texas who could pass for a navy S.E.A.L. (or a crew-cut Michael Cole), completed the triangle as hot-shot Nick Stokes.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>And in a show where everyone seems to get along. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt closer to a group of people,&rdquo; says Fox  a good thing, since the group is usually exiled to quiet Santa Clarita, a residential town one hour north of L.A that pinch-hits for the Vegas suburbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long haul,&rdquo; Helgenberger says. &ldquo;There are lots of graveyard shifts and night exteriors. Everyone gets fried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Fox, a Florida beach girl, is the &ldquo;cool-but-sweet chick&rdquo; who surfs and downs veggie burgers. And &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mother hen, for sure,&rdquo; says Helgenberger. She&rsquo;s even been known to bring in pies for the cast and crew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly Betty Crocker, so I don&rsquo;t actually <em>make</em> them,&rdquo; she laughs. &ldquo;I just try to make sure everyone&rsquo;s doing okay, keep the spirits up.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>BEST IN SHOWS:</strong></p>

<p>After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</p>

<p><strong>READ THIS BACKWARDS AND IT&rsquo;LL MAKE MORE SENSE:</strong></p>

<p>Jorja had a role in the indie-film sensation Memento.</p>

<p><strong>OUR WEIRD-RADAR WAS IMPOUNDED:</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have that weird-radar, because the people who talk to me are almost never creepy. You&rsquo;ve gotta wonder what kind of vibe you&rsquo;re putting out there if you&rsquo;re having really creepy people come talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ONES THAT SLIP THROUGH:</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have a drink in my hand, sometimes it accidentally falls in the direction of the person. I haven&rsquo;t gone home with anybody who tried to pick me up in a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>WE FORGOT TO ASK:</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to ask me what my favorite dildo is or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think &#8216;Make love, not war&rsquo; might be the most profound statement that&rsquo;s ever been made. If people were spending more time having sex, they&rsquo;d be a lot less inclined to be violent.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>We go &ldquo;undercover&rdquo; with C.S.I&rsquo;s Jorja Fox. By which we mean we dress her in crazy getups and ask her silly questions. It&rsquo;s our m.o.!</p>

<p>Silver Lake, California, 3:19 on a sunny afternoon at the dog park, about a softball pitch away from downtown L.A.: I was scheduled to meet Jorja Fox at 3 P.M. and follow her around with a tape recorder while she walked her dogs. Just when I start to think, This sucks, I see a sprightly, tank-topped, ponytailed woman come bounding through the gates. It&rsquo;s her Jorja Fox! And I was just beginning to feel like a creep sitting in this place without a dog. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m late! You must have felt like a creep sitting in this place alone without a dog&rdquo;, she says. &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;, I say. After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja Fox is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. And with a role in last year&rsquo;s indie-film sensation Memento, the lovely Ms. Fox is proving that she&rsquo;s a lucky charm of sorts - or at least something I&rsquo;d like to have draped around my neck. On CSI she plays a scientist who must find the answers to many bizarre and often sordid questions. I decided to turn the tables on her. It&rsquo;s funny seeing her there - you know, under the table.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Your character on CSI knows a thing or two about crime scenes. What sort of things should we watch out for if we murdered someone and didn&rsquo;t want to be linked to the crime? Theoretically, of course.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Well, I definitely think you should not murder anyone, under any circumstances - ever!</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> It&rsquo;s a little late for that right now.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I would say call the paramedics first then call the cops. If you can&rsquo;t do that, then just cover your entire body in latex and get rid of the corpse and you&rsquo;ll probably get away with it.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> How should I get rid of the body?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> A piranha fish tank is my personal pick.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> When a director asks you to be angry, do you think of the time the neighborhood bully threw your pet turtle down a well.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Anger is very easy for me. The hardest thing a director could ever ask me to do is cry. That&rsquo;s when I become super-actory. I have to go in a corner and psyche myself up for it. I think I&rsquo;m kind of an angry person. Anger is something I identify with. For better or worse.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the strangest outfit you like to put on when nobody else is home?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Well, my friend who works for the city left his uniform at my house one night and didn&rsquo;t come back, so I tried on this whole weird sort of construction thing with a tool belt. That&rsquo;s pretty kinky.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Let&rsquo;s say I showed up at your house on a typical Sunday morning, flashed my badge and dusted the headboard of your bed for fingerprints. How many different sets would I find?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Fingers and toes?. Probably only five or six right now.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> That&rsquo;s a big headboard.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I sleep on the floor, by the way.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> In preparation for the weekend, have you ever stolen a set of handcuffs or rubber gloves from the set?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Rubber gloves always comes in handy. I don&rsquo;t use handcuffs on the show, but there&rsquo;s probably a set in my house.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> When someone creepy sidles up to you at a bar, how do you get rid of him?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t really happen to me. I might have that weird-radar, because people who talk to me are almost never creepy. I&rsquo;m really lucky that way. You&rsquo;ve gotta wonder what kind of vibe you&rsquo;re putting out there if you&rsquo;re having really creepy people come talk to you.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the worst pickup line you&rsquo;ve ever heard that used your last name?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Maybe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling very sly, and I know &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re a Fox that you&rsquo;d want to make it with me&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> I don&rsquo;t even get it. How do you respond to something like that?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> If I have a drink in my hand, sometimes it accidentally falls in the direction of the person. If somebody&rsquo;s nice enough to come up to me and be interested in me, it&rsquo;s almost always a really cool thing. Unless they&rsquo;re really gross about it. I haven&rsquo;t gone home with anybody who tried to pick me up in a long time.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Would you say you&rsquo;re crazy like a fox, or is your last name nothing but a lie?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Until I was 14 years old, I was really fat - I was obese. And I have this gap between my teeth. At that time, it was twice the size - you could put a quarter through it - and I had freckles. My mom bought FOXY GIRL T-shirts - which were big, sort of, in the 70&rsquo;s - for every day of the week, and I had to wear one every day. It was kind of brutal. It was very difficult to live up to that. The whole &ldquo;foxy&rdquo; thing is funny, because for most of my life it was so not true. It was like a reverse joke. But, yeah, I&rsquo;m crazy. I&rsquo;m totally crazy. It&rsquo;s true. All of my family members are crazy, too. There&rsquo;s a lot in a name.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the strangest thing you&rsquo;ve ever gotten stuck in that gap between your front teeth?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I&rsquo;d have to say rocks. A couple of rocks, I was camping, it was dark, I was caught up in the moment and I got some rocks in my teeth.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Rocks. Your face was in the dirt?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Gently, but yes.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What are some of your vices, besides the cigarette you&rsquo;re smoking right now?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Ha! Well, I stay up really late, I drink coffee and alcohol and I like to be bad. Bad! But I don&rsquo;t have so many vices.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What kind of drink could I buy you?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> A beer. I would really be impressed. A bottle of beer. Nice beer - a microbrew. No glass. Amber is my favorite.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> You play guitar: Have you ever gone to a store and tried out a new guitar by playing &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> No, but I do know how to play &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen people do that. Once or twice I&rsquo;ve even taken them outside and let them know that it&rsquo;s probably not all that cool.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> You&rsquo;re a self-described liberal. Will you use your fame to save the world?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Wow! I would sure love to try.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Where would you start?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Honestly? Two places: the environment, to be very serious, and sex.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Sex.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I think &ldquo;Make love, not war&rdquo; might be the most profound statement that&rsquo;s ever been made. If people were spending more time having sex, they&rsquo;d be a lot less inclined to be violent.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> You&rsquo;re not going to ask me what my favorite dildo is or something?</p>
