<p><strong>Question: </strong>I know you will probably give me your stock answer about &ldquo;ships&rdquo; and the realities of TV business, but don&rsquo;t you think the break-up of Sara and Grissom on *CSI* was unusually cruel to the long suffering fans of this couple? I know William Petersen won&rsquo;t be back on the show, but would it have been so bad to keep him off-screen like he has been, and let the writers keep their marriage safe and in the background? It&rsquo;s a procedural, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, not <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em>. And their fans would be content to at least know they have a good, albeit non-traditional marriage. This just seems so harsh to me. There was a carefully constructed arc for their story over 12 years; in a few episodes it seems to be completely destroyed. The show will probably not be around much longer, so why? They seem to not care about their old loyal fans, and certainly have disregarded the avid GSR fanbase. I know it&rsquo;s silly to get caught up in fictional &#8216;ships (and this is the only one I ever became invested in), but this one seemed like it would really make it after that wonderful final scene of Grissom and Sara in the jungle. Now it&rsquo;s just &hellip; ugh &hellip; so frustrating. It taints the whole series for me, and certainly erases Petersen&rsquo;s wonderful exit arc.  <em>Jan</em></p>

<p><strong>Matt Roush:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure how wonderful or satisfying Grissom&rsquo;s exit arc was  the show never really recovered from losing him  and I always found this off-camera relationship puzzling and a bit off-putting, but I&rsquo;m more upset to think I have a &ldquo;stock answer&rdquo; for this sort of thing. Because I do think you have a point where this show and these characters are concerned. At least Nick was able to express the feelings I imagine so many longtime *CSI *fans have, that we accepted and perhaps even embraced the idea of the Sara-Grissom marriage because it sustained a connection, however tenuous, with the show&rsquo;s most beloved character. I may not be as upset as the &ldquo;shippers&rdquo; about the dissolving of the marriage  how many long-distance relationships ever work?  but the way it was addressed so off-handedly, keeping the drama of the split off-stage as usual, would have to be a letdown to anyone who has an investment in these characters. That said, I thought Jorja Fox did a fine job expressing Sara&rsquo;s sadness and loneliness, even in the context of yet another episode in which a crime-solver is accused of a crime she so clearly didn&rsquo;t commit.</p>

		<p>CSI returns to UK TV tonight, with the American goliath that&rsquo;s spawned not only the rise of the pathology TV show, but also thousands of careers in forensics back to defend its crown on Channel 5.</p>

<p>As she begins to start her latest tour of duty as the devoted Sara Silde on the show, we chatted to star Jorja Fox about being on the show for more than a decade, the world of forensics and her dreams of being a rock and roll star.</p>

<p><strong>The show&rsquo;s going into its thirteenth season over here in the UK, did you ever think it would be so successful?</strong></p>

<p>You know it&rsquo;s really been a surprise and an incredible honour that we&rsquo;re still going. I&rsquo;d just like to give a shout out to our international fans for tuning in and watching. I think that we&rsquo;re very mystified every year when we&rsquo;re invited to do another (laughs). That&rsquo;s a great feeling.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s it like playing Sara for so long?</strong></p>

<p>I never imagined I would play the same character for anywhere near this amount of time. I think that as a younger person, I thought &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be great to play her for a year of two if I&rsquo;m fortunate&rsquo; and thank goodness I really adore Sara, so it makes it so easy to play her. I feel like I&rsquo;m in a place where I put on the vest, put on the boots, grab the pun and instantly I feel like her.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting experience, because as an actor you never stop building the character and asking how they&rsquo;d react to things, but with her I feel that very quickly I know who she&rsquo;d respond to almost anything.</p>

<p><strong>The writers keep Sara interesting for us at home, but what about for you. How do you keep her fresh and interesting to play after all this time?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I hope she&rsquo;s interesting to the people at home; she&rsquo;s always interesting for me. Number one because she&rsquo;s really smart and I&rsquo;m not (laughs). It&rsquo;s always fascinating that she can figure out these puzzles. The show also changes week to week, every time the characters are interacting in completely different situations, which keeps the characters fresh.</p>

<p>When I think that we&rsquo;ve told every crime out there we can tell, the writers come up with something new, weirder, crazier and darker than before. It keeps us on our toes all the time. This year, we&rsquo;re doing something we&rsquo;ve not done before as each week we deal with something very personal to each of the characters on the show.</p>

<p>So for Sara, she&rsquo;s going down some roads she&rsquo;s never been down before. It&rsquo;s personal and profoundly intimate and in some ways secretive, so that&rsquo;s a really interesting new thing.</p>

<p><strong>As you said, this series is definitely more personal, but have any of the storylines affected you personally?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, for sure. Episode seven goes back to Warwick&rsquo;s life and see what&rsquo;s become of his family since he passed away and that one was a really hard episode to shoot for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I still miss Gary Dourdan every week; I miss both him and the character on the show.</p>

<p>Also, as actors, I think we&rsquo;ve all lost someone very close to us, nobody gets on and off the planet without leaving people they really care about. So it was a little bit heart breaking and it really resonated with me personally.</p>

<p>Hopefully, some of the storylines are almost fun. We have this dynamic between Hodges and Morgan, which is all about whether you can love somebody at work and are you compatible away from that, so there&rsquo;s some comedy to that, but once again, it&rsquo;s very personal.</p>

<p>Also, because Ted Danson&rsquo;s on the show, hopefully not only because of him, the show&rsquo;s funnier and I think the writers have taken more risks with comedy than they have done in the past. That&rsquo;s been so much fun to shoot around, even though I don&rsquo;t get much of it. I&rsquo;m the girl, who gets the really dark stuff, but other characters are having really funny lines and it&rsquo;s hard not to laugh.</p>

<p><strong>Elizabeth Shue joined the cast last year, what&rsquo;s it been like showing her the rope and working with her?</strong></p>

<p>Well, she&rsquo;s so humble, but she&rsquo;s a theatrical legend in the United States. She&rsquo;s so much fun, kind of trouble, got the sort of fun loving personality that gets a girl into trouble and for her to come in and be so humble was so great and really unexpected. She picked up everything very quickly. You&rsquo;ve got these new characters and I love all three of them and I can&rsquo;t believe how lucky I am to work with them every week.</p>

<p>So for the first three of four episodes we had to show them the ropes and how everything gets done around here and now all three do everything better than me and drive me crazy! (laughs) They&rsquo;ve learnt their lines faster, they get their science talk done more smoothly, I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;Ok, guys, take it easy, you&rsquo;re making us all feel dumb&rdquo;. Its gives me something to aspire too (laughs).</p>

<p><strong>Is it true that you have a rather special guitar?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, I do, I wish I could play it the way I feel like it should! I like to actually loan it to people to play because it&rsquo;s just an amazing guitar and I never really do it any justice. I have this blonde 1965 hollow body Rickenbacher and they didn&rsquo;t make many of them and it&rsquo;s really just like listening to angels.</p>

<p><strong>Is music something you&rsquo;d like to explore more then?</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the time yet. Oddly enough when I was younger my number one dream was to be the lead singer in a rock and roll band. Acting ended up being the place where I was able to carve out a living for myself, so there was a point where I let go of music professionally.</p>

<p>It was hard for a minute, letting go of any dream is going to be like that, but it&rsquo;s something that I do now just for the fun of it. I love the fact that it&rsquo;s not professional, that it&rsquo;s just me and some friends who get together and play. It&rsquo;s nice to have something that&rsquo;s not about making a living or trying to impress anyone else.</p>

<p>**The show&rsquo;s become quite famous for actually inspiring some people to actively pursue a career in **</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s really one of the highest compliments you can get. Being on the show for thirteen years, there a lot of kids who watched the show who are now total adults and to imagine that expanse of time is really interesting. I think that there are a lot of smart people out there that watch the show and engage with it and I think it&rsquo;s fantastic to think we&rsquo;ve been a part in a resurgence of science. &nbsp;I think only great things can come from that.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be very hard for criminals to get away with things with so many forensic guys around. Then perhaps we can make the world peaceful enough that we have to stop the show as there&rsquo;s no more crime.</p>

<p><strong>So CSI&rsquo;s just actually a massive Public Service Announcement then?</strong></p>

<p>(laughs) Exactly! It&rsquo;s really hard to get away with crimes now, thank God! There have been so many technological advancements over the last twenty years and thinks like DNA evidence helps keep people who are innocent from spending a decade in jail. Those sorts of breakthroughs are incredible. Of course criminals are also coming up with new ways to commit crimes, and crime fighters have to come up with new ways to beat them. I find it a fascinating dance.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m crushed that the *CSI *writers broke up Sara and Grissom! What are they thinking?</strong></p>

<p><em>Lisa</em></p>

<p><strong>ADAM:</strong> Hopefully, this news will console you. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s <em>over</em>,&rdquo; executive producer Don McGill tells us. &ldquo;We felt the relationship had hit the true rocks and things were really at a breaking point. But they&rsquo;re not divorced or even separated. They&rsquo;re really just taking a very big time out.&rdquo; More good news: The writers aren&rsquo;t planning to throw Sara into any rebound flings and are actually hoping that this relationship hiccup might lure Grissom himself, William Petersen, back to the show. &ldquo;The door is always open,&rdquo; McGill says. Silver lining?</p>

		<p><em>CSI</em> returns to UK screens early next week - Channel 5 will begin airing season 13, which kicks off with thrill-packed premiere &#8216;Karma to Burn&rsquo;, this coming Tuesday. After the events of the season 12 finale, the <em>CSI</em> team find themselves in crisis, but must overcome the odds to rescue Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter and bring the kidnappers to justice.</p>

<p>To mark the show&rsquo;s triumphant return, <strong>Digital Spy</strong> spoke with <em>CSI</em> star <strong>Jorja Fox</strong> - who plays Sara Sidle - to get all the scoop on the new season, the show&rsquo;s future and the possibility of a Sara / Grissom reunion&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The last season of <em>CSI</em> ended with Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter in deep trouble. Where does season 13 pick up?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty much everything that could go wrong has gone wrong - Russell&rsquo;s granddaughter has been kidnapped, Ecklie (Marc Vann) is shot and in dire jeopardy - you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to make it or not</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finn (Elisabeth Shue) has disappeared off the Earth and Nick Stokes (George Eads) has quit, so pandemonium has ensued and the characters definitely spend the first half of the [season 13 premiere] running around, fearing the worst. So it&rsquo;s a suspenseful episode, for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Season 12 saw Ted Danson join the show as Russell, as well as Elisabeth Shue replacing Marg Helgenberger - has this new season felt more stable?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, actually - and a third character, Elisabeth Harnois [who plays Morgan Brody] joined two episodes before the end of season 11, so essentially her and Ted started right around the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To have three new characters in such a short period of time, it almost feels like we&rsquo;re doing a completely new show, but with all the perks of having done a show for such a long time - the people that you trust, the short-hand and the collaboration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s been an amazing season - season 12 and season 13 so far have been some of the most fun seasons I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of - and yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right to use the world &#8216;stable&rsquo;. I would say &#8216;stable&rsquo; maybe for the first time!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even before cast members began departing, there was always something exciting that would shake up the show at least once a year so, knock on wood, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying that feeling [of stability].</p>

<p>&ldquo;Season 13 is pretty much the first season of the show for many years where the writers knew what cast they would have to write for - pretty much every year they would end and they wouldn&rsquo;t know who was coming back [the following season], so it was very difficult for them to start early on stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The second episode of this season is a big one for Sara, isn&rsquo;t it?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the biggest departure for the show this season - we&rsquo;re doing something we&rsquo;ve never done before, in that virtually every episode so far has had a very profound personal storyline for at least one character on the show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve tended to avoid often in the past - we&rsquo;d maybe do this kind of stuff every ten episodes, or once a season - but we&rsquo;re getting to the core and the heart of the matter with season 13, so I hope everybody enjoys it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Episode seven &#8216;Fallen Angels&rsquo; also contains nods to the past and to the character of Warrick Brown - what can you reveal about that?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a tough one to shoot, because I miss Gary Dourdan every day. It&rsquo;s funny - he&rsquo;s been gone for a long time and I still miss him on the show. I miss his character, I miss his energy - so it was hard to go back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, in the make-believe world of <em>CSI</em>, you&rsquo;re also going back into the life of one of your best friends who&rsquo;s passed away and we find out that things are not going so well [for his family], so I think it is a really awesome episode. Meta Golding, who plays Warrick&rsquo;s wife on the show, is brilliant. But it was hard - it was one of those ones that was heartbreaking to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s also going to be a crossover between <em>CSI</em> and <em>CSI: NY</em> - what role does Sara play in that?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gary Sinise&rsquo;s character from <em>CSI: NY</em> - because he&rsquo;s in our show, he&rsquo;s having a profound personal problem. He crossed over into Las Vegas and now he&rsquo;s in the land of personal nightmares and demons!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he arrives in Las Vegas and this [case] is something that Russell is helping with very closely. My character in the <em>CSI</em> part of the crossover is off on a different crime with Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) that involves grifting - which is always really fascinating in Las Vegas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>There have been rumors that we might finally meet Sara&rsquo;s mother - do you know if that is happening?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;s been a rumor since season two! I can&rsquo;t confirm or deny it, but I would love to meet her too. She&rsquo;s a scary person! I can&rsquo;t confirm it, but that sounds great, so I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a dream actress in mind for the role?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a really, really long list, but I&rsquo;d have to say Mary Tyler Moore - I just love her so much, I&rsquo;d love the chance to see her on the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Are there any plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to make another appearance following his cameo in season eleven?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that there is some stuff [planned] - I&rsquo;m always hoping for it. I feel like Sara&rsquo;s a little young to sleep alone every night and she&rsquo;s still very much in love with Grissom, so we&rsquo;re always thinking about and hoping for some type of reunion between the two of them - at least I am. That will be a story for Sara in season 13 - what it&rsquo;s like to have a long-distance relationship and how she&rsquo;s weathering all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Last year, <em>CSI</em> was named the most watched show in the world for the fifth time. How does it feel knowing that the show remains a global phenomenon 13 seasons in?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astounding - it&rsquo;s one of the highest fan compliments the show could ever receive. We were floating on air about it for several weeks and it&rsquo;s always a surprise. It means so much that it&rsquo;s international, that it&rsquo;s global - we&rsquo;re tucked away in California doing the show, and I think we all want to be out in the world more than we are. To find out that there&rsquo;s folks out all over who are watching is an amazing feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>*<strong>CSI: Miami* sadly ended last year, but do you think there is still plenty of life left in the original <em>CSI</em>?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, for sure. Again, we&rsquo;ve been so lucky - I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s bored yet. I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve had the same job this long - as an actor, I didn&rsquo;t even know that was possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that I continue to be excited to go to work every day and I absolutely adore the people I&rsquo;m working with and unfortunately in the United States there&rsquo;s no shortage of crimes to tell stories about! So yeah, I&rsquo;d like to see us go for a couple more years, I think we got it in us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached a place with the show where we pretty much get picked up for one season at a time and that&rsquo;s okay - it&rsquo;s always been a pleasant surprise to find out that we were going to go another year. I think that we&rsquo;re certainly one of the grandparents of TV right now in the States - if we were a person, we&rsquo;d have our little cane and hearing aid and that&rsquo;s a very nice place to be in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darn it&rsquo;s hard to be a TV fan these days, no? It seems like showrunners are just out to toy with our emotions and &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; was a perfect example tonight as a longstanding fan favorite couple took a (seemingly) one-way trip to splitsville. These are dark days, our friends!</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Couples Watch:</strong> In sad, sad TV couples news, <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s Sara (<strong>Jorja Fox</strong>) and Grissom (<strong>William Petersen</strong>) are splitting up. After 13 years. We repeat: <em>13 years</em>, which is basically 100 years when it comes to TV relationships. Let&rsquo;s mourn together in the comments, shall we? We&rsquo;ll bring the chocolate, you bring the tissues.</p>
