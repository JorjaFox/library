		<p><em>Translated from French</em></p>

<p><strong>The broadcasting of the sixth season has finished in France. What&rsquo;s going to happen in season seven?</strong></p>

<p>The producers keep it secret. It&rsquo;s impossible to know where our characters will be in three months. I wonder if the writers haven&rsquo;t though about killing Sara. She&rsquo;s had almost everything else happen to her &#8212; arrest, humiliation, bad dating &hellip; She&rsquo;s been the team&rsquo;s scapegoat for a long time. Although, I can tell you that in season seven, [Gil] Grissom is going to make it up to her, which gives me a rest. At last, I can finally smile on screen!</p>

<p><strong>After seven years are you used to seeing corpses?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m stronger now, but I sometimes want to puke when I see all the special effects made by our special effects! Outdoing other TV shows has become a game for them. They never run out of ideas to show amazing deaths.</p>

<p><strong>All this [death] doesn&rsquo;t seem to make for a cheerful atmosphere on the set!</strong></p>

<p>Not at all! We laugh and we play music. We made a band &#8212; the actors and the technicians. Marg Helgenberger plays piano, Gary Dourdan plays bass and Robert David Hall plays guitar. I even want to film one of our impromptu gigs for our fans!</p>

<p><strong>When you meet fans, what do you talk about ?</strong></p>

<p>All of them want to see Sara and Gil have a love story, which is going to happen in the new season. But &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t about the private lives of its heroes. Mysteries are at the heart of every episode.</p>

<p><strong>Are you surprised by the infatuation of viewers about &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; ?</strong></p>

<p>What really surprised me is the interest our fans have in crimes. Some of them tell me complex scenarios about the best way to kill someone. At first, I was terrified about it and I felt like I had serial killers in front of me! Now I&rsquo;m more relaxed and I joke with them.</p>

<p><strong>We know very little about your private life. Why are you so secret ?</strong></p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to keep the mystery secret. And also it&rsquo;s good for the audience, so that people don&rsquo;t confuse me with my character on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>You never act in movies during your summer holiday. Is it a personal choice ?</strong></p>

<p>I work 14 hour days for nine and a half months and I don&rsquo;t want to run everywhere during my holidays. Seven years ago, I created my own theater troupe. That&rsquo;s how I relax.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have a theater project going on?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a producer of &ldquo;Dear Bernard&rdquo;, a musical comedy about an English girl who comes to Hollywood to be successful. I also suggested to the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; producers that we write a musical episode for this season. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny to see Grissom and his team singing during autopsies? We could even pretend it was all Sara&rsquo;s dream!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if those procedural dramas, after spending years putting female crime victims through the wringer (and inside locked cages and under floorboards) have run out of ideas and moved on to harassing female crime fighters instead.</p>

<p>Yet it&rsquo;s also the case that many shows &#8212; facing softening ratings after many years on the air or tougher time-slot competition &#8212; are attempting to inject more personal story lines into a genre that once regarded them like germs in the crime lab. That was before &ldquo;Desperate Housewives,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; and other shows that feature almost nothing but personal story lines (especially female-centric ones) came along to captivate audiences.</p>

<p>Still, it can be a dicey business rejiggering the formula at this late date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the beginning of our fanship, there&rsquo;s sort of been a split,&rdquo; says &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; star Jorja Fox, whose show goes head-to-head with &ldquo;Anatomy&rdquo; on Thursdays at 9 p.m. and has lost the ratings race to the hospital drama three out of four weeks this season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been about 50 percent of the audience who would like to know more about the characters and about 50 percent who would really rather stick to the stories.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I beg forgiveness for all the mean things I&rsquo;ve said recently about TV Guide, becuase I nearly died when I saw your Jorja Fox/William Petersen cover [<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub>].

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>A million thanks for your gorgeous cover photo of Jorja Fox! I have followed &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; since Day 1, and I have watched Fox change form a pretty girl to a beautiful woman. Your cover is positive proof of that! &#8212; &ldquo;Maureen Holdridge, Plattsburgh, N.Y.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship. We got &lsquo;em!</strong></p>

<p>William Petersen &ldquo;and&rdquo; Jorja Fox &ldquo;tell all about CSI&rsquo;s biggest mystery yet&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Las Vegas. Sin City.</strong> The night was black as an oil patch left by a perp&rsquo;s getaway car, but the neon lights of the Strip cast a glow on the town tlike a rainbow on a bender. That&rsquo;s when we saw them &hellip; Grissom and Sidle, two CSIs who had no business being in a bedrobe together. The dame wore a robe, like she&rsquo;d just stepped out of the shower. And Grissom &hellip; her boss &hellip; lay on the bed, talking about death.</p>

<p>Turns out relationships that happen in Vegas don&rsquo;t always stay in Vegas. Here&rsquo;s the evidence: In the last scene of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;&rsquo;s May season finale, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) shocked viewers with their romantic rendezvous. Fan Web sites went nuts. TV GUIDE got lots of letters &#8212; some people liked the relationship; others wanted to send the storyline on a slow boat to China. We had to know: What were the producers thinking?</p>

<p>Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn came clean. This promises to be the most personal season of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; yet. Good thing, too, since it&rsquo;s now going up against TV&rsquo;s sudsiest smash, &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;. &ldquo;The bones of Season 7 will be the toll the job has on our CSIs,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The sin in Sin City is beginning to wear on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next we talked to exec producers Naren Shankar: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to turn into a soap opera, but we&rsquo;re going to see their anger with the world, and them reaching out to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they really sang like canaries: Turns out &ldquo;all&rdquo; the CSIs will get roughed up this season, in one way or another.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what we got. Now it&rsquo;s your turn. TV GUIDE sat down with Petersen and Fox to ask the &ldquo;your&rdquo; questions (collected on <a href="http://www.tvguide.com">tvguide.com</a>) about all that&rsquo;s happened and what&rsquo;s still to come on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Does the fan response to this new relationship shock you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>William Petersen:</strong> We knew there was a shock value to it because of the little bits and moments that Sara and Grissom have had over the years. So to see them together that way would have impact in terms of, &ldquo;Whoa, there they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I like the mystery of it. It left so many more questions than it really answered. And I think we&rsquo;re all going to figure that out as we go into this season. Billy and I aren&rsquo;t necessarily that far ahead of the audience with this one.</p>

<p><strong>How long have Grissom and Sara been seeing each other?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> We may find out more about that from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think Grissom so coldly said no to a relationship in earlier seasons but decided to accept it now?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Obviously, this relationship is fraught with danger for Grissom. He and Sara have a mentor-protegee relationship and it&rsquo;d be difficult for anyone in that situation. What one might say one day might not necessarily be how one feels. And what one ends up doing may not be what one thought he or she would be doing.</p>

<p><strong>Please, please, can we have a kiss before all is said and done?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> &ldquo;[Laughing]&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to think we could. We&rsquo;d love to kiss but the network would have to cough up some more money for that. Tongue would cost more. Sometimes they pay you for things that are fun.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Petersen, what were you thinking when you chose to wear that aloha shirt in the Season 6 finale? Did the thought of being shirtless ever cross your mind?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Regarding being shirtless, it never crossed my mind. That aloha shirt has a history. I got it in the Philippines 10 years ago off a guy&rsquo;s back. I traded him shirts in the jungle. For Grissom, it was something different. This is how he lets his hair down when he&rsquo;s with someone he trusts.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Sure, Sara loves Grissom in the buff. But I don&rsquo;t think that was what the scene was about. One of my favorite things was Grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters. And maybe they go home after the things they&rsquo;ve seen and have some tenderness of their own.</p>

<p><strong>Which character will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s hidden romance?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Sara and Grissom are not going to let people find out, which makes it even more intense. I don&rsquo;t know who would find out first or how they&rsquo;d react. I do know there are several actors dying to be the one who finds out. &ldquo;[Laughs]&rdquo; Paul Guilfoyle has already gone to the writers saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The chemistry between the entire group seems to be changing &hellip; the bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why?</strong><br />
<strong>Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry the writer feels that way. The writer will be happy to find out there&rsquo;s some Warrick and Nick stuff coming up early in this season.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, you play Sara so well, I wonder if you are like her?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I am probably more like her than any other character I&rsquo;ve played, which is lucky considering that this has been going on for six years. Billy swears that he&rsquo;s acting like Grissom, and that must be exhausting for you &ldquo;[Petersen laughs]&ldquo;. I do like her a lot. She&rsquo;s much smarter than I am. But I also like to focus on one thing for a while. We have OCD in common. I&rsquo;m very idealistic, like Sara.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Lady Heather is Grissom&rsquo;s soul mate?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> I think she&rsquo;s his spanking partner. Every now and then a guy needs a good spanking. Lady Heather could teach this country a lot. How to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Definitely how to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It would be great if Lady Heather and Sara met. It would be a fun scene to do. When we go places that are sensual, sexual or a bit exotic or scandalous, Sara&rsquo;s never there. She&rsquo;s at the car-wash murder across town &ldquo;[laughs]&ldquo;. So it is a pet peeve of mine that these episodes get written and I&rsquo;m miles away. And I wonder if that&rsquo;s partially control on Grissom&rsquo;s part, since he hands out the cases.</p>

<p><strong>Now that you&rsquo;ll be going up against &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;, will you be adding more story lines about the personal relationships on the show to attract some of the &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; fans?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I wish them well. It&rsquo;s a great show and a lot of wonderful people are involved.</p>

		<p>You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship, and we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em. For the occasion of &ldquo;CSI**s Season 7 premiere (tonight at 9 pm/ET), TV Guide brought your burning questions, collected at TVGuide.com,&nbsp;to series stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox. In addition to what follows, look for many more Q&rsquo;s and A&rsquo;s in the new <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/Magazine/default.aspx">TV Guide magazine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Are you surprised that a show that is not knownfor its romantic plots is now getting such a huge reaction for one scene at the end of one episode?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **Very surprised. It&rsquo;s a huge compliment to the show. There&rsquo;s this sense that the folks who have been watching loyally for so long are still really invested in what&rsquo;s happening to the characters. I know there are&nbsp;positive &ldquo;and&rdquo; negative responses, but it&rsquo;s nice to be causing a strong, emotional response.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **We held back on any of that kind of stuff for six years for a reason. If you were going to do something like this a couple of years ago, where would we be now? Probably divorced.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: We know Mr. Petersen will be away for a couple of weeks this season [performing in a play in Providence, Rhode Island]. Do you think Sara will be true to Grissom while he&rsquo;s away?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **I would like to think she would. It&rsquo;s only for a couple of weeks. We&rsquo;re still working on how that&rsquo;s going to unfold.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t know if they even have a monogamous relationship. I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve defined that. It&rsquo;s possible Sara would be true to him, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s definite.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: Knowing that eventually the administration will find out about the relationship, what consequences do you think will be in store for them career-wise? And if they were told to choose between their relationship and their jobs, what do you think they would do?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **I don&rsquo;t know that Grissom has ever been in love, or that he&rsquo;s in love now, so I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to answer that question.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Sara, by virtue of being a realist, is also very much a romantic. So I think if she really was in love with someone, and it came down to a choice between work and love, I think she&rsquo;d go in the direction of love.</p>

<p><strong>Question: If you do not already know, which character do you think will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s hidden romance?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t really know how to answer that one.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **People call this show a procedural, but it&rsquo;s a procedural that has characters the audience has come to know. As actors, there&rsquo;s a fine line to balance between the show you&rsquo;re doing and what you might like to do with your character. Go too far and it becomes a soap opera, and that&rsquo;s something we won&rsquo;t let happen. That&rsquo;s why the scene at the end of last season was so subtle. It was one camera move, a&nbsp;little conversation. There were people who wanted us to be in bed talking but that was not something we wanted to do. That&rsquo;s not Grissom and Sidle. I don&rsquo;t think they have any idea where their relationship is going. They haven&rsquo;t been able to go to a restaurant together, they can&rsquo;t go out and have a date, because everyone in the place would know us&hellip;. The show is about solving puzzles, to solve things and figure out things. And that&rsquo;s what this is:&nbsp;a puzzle to us and to the audience.</p>

<p>**Fox: **But part of the fun of a puzzle is at least thinking that&nbsp;at some point you&rsquo;ll figure something out. The show does that well.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **There were all kinds of [hints] over the years &#8212; people saw they were flirting &#8212; but that was just between Jorja and I. There were never other people in the scene getting these little tidbits, but the audience got them and was confused by them. Do they like each other? Do they not like each other? Are they doing it, are they not doing it? There was a time, years ago, where they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve flirted around with Grissom and Sara, but it&rsquo;s time for us to stop. This will be a moment, a big moment, and it&rsquo;ll be over.&rdquo; We said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolish. We have great chemistry together. We enjoy the banter they have. We enjoy the subtext of all that. Why end it just because you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going to go? Allow us to play whatever it may be, and who knows?&rdquo; So now we&rsquo;ve ended up with this. Had we done what they talked about, we wouldn&rsquo;t be where we are now. If you give it all away, you can&rsquo;t go anywhere from there. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;&nbsp;&#8212; you have a big scene one week, and you&rsquo;re dead the next.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, Sara&rsquo;s character used to lean on Nick in the earlier seasons. What kind of relationship would you like to see for them in the upcoming season?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **I hope that George [Eads] and I get to work together a lot this year. We have a great familiarity and a great sense of humor when we&rsquo;re together.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Sometimes we go through many episodes without working with some of the guys. It&rsquo;s just the way the story lines evolve. [In] the beginning, we were all together on everything, but now they can do whole stories with just one or two of us.</p>

<p><strong>Question: The chemistry between the entire group, in my opinion, seems to be changing. I&rsquo;ve noticed the strong bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why do you think that&rsquo;s happening?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **There is less of a camaraderie than there was.</p>

<p>**Fox: **You think so?</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Part of it is because of the growth of the characters. In the beginning, everyone was struggling to do the job right. Now they&rsquo;ve all grown and become very good at it, and there&rsquo;s less opportunity for the chemistry to play. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;like the first few days on a championship baseball team [where] they all have fun in the locker room, they all have fun in the bars. It&rsquo;s a very serious tone on the show, too. The tone has changed over time.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t know if I agree. [The episode] &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo; brought everyone back together.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **I&rsquo;m not saying anything about the chemistry &#8212; it&rsquo;s still there &#8212; there&rsquo;s just not as much opportunity to play it. We used to always go into the DNA lab and have fun with Greg. Well, Greg isn&rsquo;t in the lab anymore; he&rsquo;s out in the field, going through all kinds of trials, so he isn&rsquo;t the same fun, happy-go-lucky Greg. George has had a terrible trauma so he&rsquo;s no longer punching Warrick in the shoulder, going, &ldquo;Hey, I bet I can do this better than you can.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re not kids anymore. It&rsquo;s like life in that way.</p>

<p><strong>Question: What has been your favorite episode to film?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **Certainly the Quentin Tarantino episode [&ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo;] was great. That was a full two hours, a big job for everybody.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I really liked &ldquo;A Bullet Runs Through It,&rdquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Parts&nbsp;1 and 2. That was incredibly good.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **The big ones create more memories for us. Sometimes we&rsquo;ll work on a show for&nbsp;eight or&nbsp;nine days, so to spend &ldquo;three weeks&rdquo; on the same story line is great for us. You feel like you were there because it was bigger.</p>

<p>**Fox: **We have a two-parter coming at the start of the [new] season that feels like we have been shooting for three months.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, in his TV Guide interview, Eric Szmanda said that Greg hasn&rsquo;t give up on Sara yet. What do you think Sara&rsquo;s reaction will be once she learns about the deep feelings Greg has for her?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **That question intrigues me because Eric &ldquo;broke up with me&rdquo; in a magazine last summer. We were working a little tension on the show between Greg and Sara, when I read in a magazine that Eric was done with all that. I called him and said, &ldquo;If you want to break up with me, at least do it in person.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so great to have your private relationships play out in the press.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Isn&rsquo;t that great? Now our characters are in the &ldquo;National Enquirer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather? If so, how would Sara react to her and Grissom&rsquo;s past?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **It would be a fun scene to get to do. Sara sat out a lot of the Lady Heather stuff.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **We had this scene where we talked about the guy with the corset damage. Sara asks Grissom where he got his information and he just said, &ldquo;I have my sources.&rdquo; To those who caught that, they&rsquo;ll think he must have learned what he knew from Lady Heather. He doesn&rsquo;t talk to Sara about Lady Heather or his infatuation any more than any guy would discuss his infatuation with another woman while talking to his woman.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Grissom is good at keeping secrets.</p>

<p><strong>Question: If &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is allowed to go for six &ldquo;more&rdquo; years, what would you like, or not like, to see happen?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **How we&rsquo;d raise our 5-year-old baby. [&ldquo;Fox laughs&rdquo;] Less death, I guess. More robberies, fewer murders.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I&rsquo;m determined that when I see gray hair on Eric Szmanda&rsquo;s head, I&rsquo;m leaving. I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **I don&rsquo;t think we can even afford to think like that. When we started, we were on Friday nights at 9 o&rsquo;clock and were just hoping we&rsquo;d see Christmas. We get the scripts two days before we shoot them, so it&rsquo;s pretty hard to think what we&rsquo;d like to do next year.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I will say thanks to the [question] writer for saying that there will be six more years for us.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **When you&rsquo;re first building something, you&rsquo;re fearless because every moment is desperate. Every moment could be your last. When you achieve success over time, you can&rsquo;t live like that anymore, and you don&rsquo;t have to. But then you have to figure out how to stay sharp, and that becomes a very tricky dance.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Every year that we&rsquo;re lucky enough to be on, the statistics make it seem more likely that it&rsquo;ll be our last. But I think we&rsquo;re bringing our game face this year.</p>
