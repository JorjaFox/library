		<p><strong>TV&rsquo;s No. 1 show finally investigates the team&rsquo;s private lives.</strong></p>

<p><em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> has always been stingy with details about the private lives of its workaholic characters, and they, in turn, don&rsquo;t know much about one another. But this &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; policy is about to backfire on forensics chief Gil Grissom (played by William Petersen). His crime lab will blow up in the May 8 episode, triggering revalations &ldquo;that are bigger than the explosion itself,&rdquo; says Carol Mendelsohn, executive producer of the CBS hit. &ldquo;A lot of emotions and truth will come to the surface.&rdquo; Grissom, who might have prevented the accident had he been aware of personal problems facing his staff, will be forced to deal with his own long-held secret- his loss of hearing. An unspoken attraction will also escalate, sort of. Teases Mendelsohn: &ldquo;In just one word, Hrissom will say more about his feelings for Sara [Jorja Fox] than he could in 10 pages of dialouge.&rdquo; &#8212; <em>Michael Logan</em></p>

		<p>The star of TV&rsquo;s top show, CSI, on marriage allergies, getting frisked and bad smells in the lab.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : When confronted with something gruesome, who is more likely to get queasy, you or your co-star Marg Helgenberger?</p>

<p>FOX : Me, for sure. Marg is one of the strongest and toughest women I&rsquo;ve ever met. Recently, while filming scenes for <em>CSI</em>, she has been in a meat market working with carcasses, walked through garbage at a disgusting landfill in Santa Clarita, California and worked in the pouring rain for days. She&rsquo;s a badass &#8212; she internalizes her disgust. When Marg, George Eads and I were at that landfill, Marg when into shock for an hour and barely said anything. We&rsquo;d ask, &ldquo;Marg, are you OK?&rdquo; and she&rsquo;d just not. George was trying not to get sick, and true to my Lower East Side New York City roots, I was screaming at the writers, &ldquo;You guys are fucking crazy! You fucking suck,&rdquo; for maybe 10 minutes. Because I&rsquo;m the squeamish one, they think it&rsquo;s funny to put me on the grossest cases, which they do consistently. That episode about the high school cheerleader who gets upset and eats one of her classmates? That was my case.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Any pranksters on the show?</p>

<p>FOX : We take turns. One of the crew members &#8212; who will remain nameless &#8212; brought in a remote-controlled farting device. I had a lot of fun with that. One day I was in every scene, and as a new actor would come to the set, I would use the machine. We got Billy Petersen while he was on camera. And I got Marg in rehearsal. But Marg has a 12-year-old son and she barely blinked. I thought it would get her so much better than it did. i acted like it was me who had passed gas and I just said &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, excuse me.&rdquo; She got it. But I was meaner with Billy and acted like he was the one who&rsquo;d passed gas. That fart machine entertained us for an entire afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Is craft service on <em>CSI</em> different from other shows?</p>

<p>FOX : There are several of us who have a hard time eating at work. If we&rsquo;re doing something disgusting, I have to wait until it&rsquo;s over before I will touch food. A couple of months ago I was working with Eric Szamnda and we were going through a guy&rsquo;s stomach contents. It&rsquo;s season three and we&rsquo;re feeling cocky saying, &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t even bother me.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve got this vomit on the table and we&rsquo;re picking pieces out of it, trying to decide what the guy had eaten. Then we broke for a meal, which was pizza that night, and we both said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, let&rsquo;s have a slice. That sounds great.&rdquo; We went back to work and were on the set maybe 10 minutes before we were completely nauseated.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Has the show made you more life affirming or more cautious?</p>

<p>FOX : Life affirming. it&rsquo;s left me believing that if it&rsquo;s your day, it&rsquo;s your day. I&rsquo;m not stupid about my own safety, but I&rsquo;d never want to be paranoid either. Death is very close to life. It&rsquo;s always hovering closer than we&rsquo;d like to think. But it doesn&rsquo;t scare me.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What other franchises are in the works? <em>CSI: The Hamptons</em>?</p>

<p>FOX : <em>CSI: Hawaii</em> would be lovely. The only one I&rsquo;ve heard of that seems to have credence is <em>CSI: London</em>, which would be an interesting show.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What does it say about our society that we can&rsquo;t seem to get along without a lot of shows about crime and forensics?</p>

<p>FOX : We live in a gray world right now, and some of that grayness is great, certainly where social and moral issues are concerned. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. That&rsquo;s what makes CSI so reassuring: It&rsquo;s nice to watch something and find out without a shadow of a doubt what happened. But the amount of violence in this country is horrible. Michael Moore, in <em>Bowling for Columbine</em> &#8212; one of the best movies I&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20 years &#8212; asks why America has such a thirst for violence. There are several good theories: We are only a hundred years from being a hunter-gatherer society. It&rsquo;s in our genes and we act that way in our daily lives. I also think people don&rsquo;t have enough sex.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Would David Caruso be welcomed on <em>CSI</em> or would he and Bill Petersen out-earnest each other?</p>

<p>FOX : I&rsquo;d love it if David Caruso were to do a show or two with us. I think he and Billy would have a good time together, though I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;d do it. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, David is welcome anytime, especially if he works with the ladies.</p>

<p><strong>8</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Have you used any special investigative or forensic skills in your personal life?</p>

<p>FOX : No. I prefer to use my intuition, which is wrong half the time. If I were to use too much information from the show, I would become Howard Hughes paranoid.</p>

<p><strong>9</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Have you ever asked for DNA samples from a date?</p>

<p>FOX : No. I hope I wouldn&rsquo;t have to, but it&rsquo;s great that it&rsquo;s available. A lot of men finding out that they aren&rsquo;t, in fact, fathers, and it&rsquo;s a healthy thing for them to know one way or the other.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Are people creepier in real life or on television?</p>

<p>FOX : I guess that depends on where you hang out. People are creepy in real life, but there is something much creepier about people who are seemingly normal but can act like serial killers. But I have to cme to their defense because I&rsquo;m an actor. The schizophrenic positions that we put ourselves in for a living are pretty disturbing to an outside, but not to me.</p>

<p><strong>11</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Which star of a comedy show would you like to see as a victim on <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p>FOX : Larry David! I&rsquo;d love to see him naked in the morgue. I&rsquo;ve never met him, but I love his show. He&rsquo;s brilliant and funny, and it would be great to see him as a corpse.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : If the cast of <em>Friends</em> is worth millions of dollars per episode and they just sit around &hellip;</p>

<p>FOX : There&rsquo;s certainly hope for actors everywhere that there&rsquo;s no ceiling on employment.</p>

<p><strong>13</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : What&rsquo;s the worst-smelling thing in the lab?</p>

<p>FOX : Burned human skin. Sometimes we wish the show were scratch-and-sniff, because we have to pretend that we&rsquo;re encountering bad smells all the time. Maybe that&rsquo;s for season four or five.</p>

<p><strong>14</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : You go home after filming an episode that involves a particularly grisly crime. What do you do to fix yourself?</p>

<p>FOX : Probably have a cold beer and a hot bath and I might have nightmares. Right now I really like Pilsner Urquell beer &#8212; a lot.</p>

<p><strong>15</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : We understand you&rsquo;re allergic to marriage. What are the symptoms?</p>

<p>FOX : Heart palpitations. And a feeling that I can&rsquo;t get enough oxygen. Cold sweats come with that. A burning desire to get into a fast car and drive quickly out of state. I have an inability to properly communicate, then the phone mysteriously breaks so I can&rsquo;t return calls. I hope to get over it someday, actually. I believe in true love and commitment and intimacy. That stuff is great. But, yes, I have this little problem.</p>

<p><strong>16</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Do you get out of paying for speeding tickets?</p>

<p>FOX : Who says I speed? No, I would never do that. Maybe there are a couple of things I would try to get out of if caught. But for the most part, I would take responsibility. I&rsquo;m not a huge speeder. I have a speed warning on my car. I set it at a certain speed and try not to go over it. But when I&rsquo;m in the car and the music is up, I could look down and be 20, 25 miles over the limit.</p>

<p><strong>17</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : For security reasons, have you been thoroughly frisked lately?</p>

<p>FOX : Yeah, actually, I have. Isn&rsquo;t it a normal part of air travel these days? I took a flight with Gary Dourdan and George. We were flying first-class from Los Angeles to Vegas and had one-way tickets. We were stopped at every possible point along the way, probably six times. Our shoes were off, our pants were rolled up. My shirt was up to here, the guys&rsquo; shirts were off. It was kind of fun to share that with two other people. I realize it was because of the one-way tickets. I support the airlines and the things they have to do to keep travel safe, but that one was a bit much &#8212; a threesome frisk. I saw parts of George and Gary that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. And that was comforting.</p>

<p><strong>18</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : We understand you can play <em>Stairway to Heaven</em> on guitar. Do you do any other solo tributes?</p>

<p>FOX : I have never been good at cover songs, mostly because it&rsquo;s so obvious that you can&rsquo;t play when you do them. If I make something up, I can fool people for a while. But the minute you offer up a song people know, they find out whether you&rsquo;re good or not. I can play a little bit of Van Morrison and Traffic, some Beatles stuff and a little Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I was madly in love with a boy in junior high who played guitar. I picked up the guitar because I thought it would be a way to hang out with him. When I stopped hanging out with him. I kept playing. I have a 1967 Rickenbacker hollow-body electric. It&rsquo;s beautiful. And I have a Yamaha acoustic, a brilliant guitar. It was a gift from some friends many years ago. Having a guitar that beautiful inspires me to get better.</p>

<p><strong>19</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Besides your name, what do you have alternative spellings for?</p>

<p>FOX : My mom made up Jorja. I spent the first 10 years of my life convincing people that I knew how to spell my name. Everyone tried to tell me I couldn&rsquo;t spell. I&rsquo;m not a good talker. I&rsquo;m not very verbal, so I don&rsquo;t have alternative names for most things. I&rsquo;m lucky if I can get something out that&rsquo;s more than two syllables. In English.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong></p>

<p>PLAYBOY : Has anyone made a charming play on your last name? And how did you reward it.</p>

<p>FOX : Yes. I stayed for breakfast.</p>

<p>Question: Is CSI ever going to get involved with the characters&rsquo; personal lives? I love the show (no show can compare, in my opinion), but many people, including myself, are dying for some romance. Are they holding out on us, or are Catherine and Grissom just never going to open their eyes and see that they want one another? &#8212; Janine</p>

<p>Matt: I think the show is wise to make this sort of thing subtext, not put on the front burner. CSI is a procedural crime drama, first and foremost, and the worst thing that could happen is for it to become a workplace romantic drama (like NYPD Blue, which has lost much of its oomph and edge as its detectives keep partnering off with each other). Prediction: I wouldn&rsquo;t count on Catherine and Grissom ever making more than significant eye contact together. But CSI hasn&rsquo;t entirely been without a personal story here and there. Not long ago, Sara (Jorja Fox) learned her paramedic beau had a serious girlfriend after both were involved in an accident. I think this show is happiest when its main characters are at their loneliest. They live for their work, and that&rsquo;s why we watch.</p>

		<p>She plays a steel-nerved forensics investigator on CSI, but Jorja Fox still gets squeamish recalling her anatomy class at Melbourne (Fla.) High School. &ldquo;It required dissecting. When the cats arrived, I asked for a pregnant one,&rdquo; says Fox, 34. &ldquo;I thought I was really rugged, but by week&rsquo;s end, I could barely stay in class.&rdquo; Fortunately for Fox, the atmosphere on the CSI set isn&rsquo;t particularly grim. &ldquo;We shot a scene with an actress who was strapped on a gurney and couldn&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;[William Petersen] and I started tickling her. The victims really have to watch out for us.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Variety puts a call through to California and speaks to Jorja Fox about what&rsquo;s fast becoming everyone&rsquo;s favourite crime series on television, C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation. MUMTAJ BEGUM dusts for prints and gets the inside story.</p>

<p>NO one was more surprised than Jorja (pronounced Georgia, like the US state) Fox when the television series C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation took off the way it did. Embraced by both critics and viewers, it was the highest-rated new drama in 2000-2001 in the United States. Its second season has been consistently amongst the top three TV series in the US primetime ratings and it&rsquo;s also the No.1 show on all of US network television.</p>

<p>Fox, who plays the dedicated forensic investigator Sara Sidle, says: &ldquo;When it first started, we didn&rsquo;t know if anybody would want to watch a show about science and death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 35-year-old actress reckons it&rsquo;s because death is not a topic many people are comfortable talking about. And almost every week, somebody dies a violent death in C.S.I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Science is always a hard sell except maybe when it&rsquo;s a big Hollywood movie. But these subject matters on C.S.I. were something different from what was on TV when we first started. Also, the technology is happening right now, we have the ability to do things (in solving crimes) that we couldn&rsquo;t do years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>C.S.I. revolves around a passionate team of forensic investigators that uses evidence at a crime scene to build up a solid case and ultimately to find the perpetrators. What&rsquo;s interesting about this show is that the team is made up of ethical professionals who never compromise their principles. This is especially striking since the Criminalistics Bureau is situated in Las Vegas, a city where corruption is not even a dirty word.</p>

<p>Another interesting element of the show are the special effects used in showing the details of a crime and the technology available in solving crimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much of the show we don&rsquo;t get to see. I only see my storyline; the special effects come in after. It&rsquo;s kind of fun for me to watch because there are a bunch of missing pieces that I don&rsquo;t get to see unless I watch the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching the programme has also allowed the general public to become familiar with terms like buccal swab (a sampling of the cells lining the inside of a mouth to obtain DNA), luminol (a spray used to detect traces of blood) and purge fluid (liquids taken from a dead body).</p>

<p>A recent report revealed that some people serving on juries in the US courts have a better perception of scientific evidence thanks to C.S.I. According to Fox, there is a good and bad outcome to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, juries are understanding better when a scientist explains evidence, but people are also going to the police and wondering why their cases can&rsquo;t be solved in six hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was one of the discrepancies pointed out by real forensic investigative teams when C.S.I. made its debut ? cases cannot be solved as fast as implied on the show. While a fingerprint identification search takes only a matter of minutes on screen, in real life it could take days to find a close match.</p>

<p>Fox agrees: &ldquo;We try to make the show as slick as we can but sometimes we have to cheat. Some of the procedures that we do on the show take a lot longer (in reality). But we use real stories on the show ? stories taken from headlines. Writers spend a lot of time with current events. And if something touches their heart they will also try to tell that story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In life things are never black and white. They&rsquo;re usually grey. In our show it&rsquo;s very rare that something definitely happened or didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crimes aside, there is very little information on the background of the characters. Once in a while, viewers are teased with tidbits like how Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) used to work as a dancer at a strip joint and how Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) once was a gambling addict. Nick Stokes (George Eads) is often frustrated at how slow his advancement at the department has been and of late there has been a certain spark between Sara Sidle and her boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah&rdquo; is Fox&rsquo;s reaction when asked what&rsquo;s up between Sidle and Grissom. &ldquo;What do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the tension between Grissom and Sara is going to continue for a while and it&rsquo;s going to have different phases. Basically, I think Sara does carry a torch for Grissom. But you have to ask what Bill (Petersen) thinks of Sara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who have been watching the new season on AXN would realise that the third season has a more personal touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not so personal because the show will always be a science show. Just a little history on the character, hopefully with some interesting personal twists and turns. I&rsquo;m very excited to see what the writers are going to come up with because the pressure&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes too much success leads to too many spin-offs. There is the first spin-off C.S.I.: Miami and now there is talk of yet another spin-off set in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Forensic investigation has also become a fashionable job. But is it something that Fox can do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never do it. I have a tremendous amount of respect for them. The burnout rate is very, very high, of course. They do the job for five or 10 years and then they move on. There is a lot of violence in this country (United States). And when you see violence like that, it&rsquo;s very hard to stomach. It&rsquo;ll make me a very, very angry person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An environmentalist and animal lover, Fox confesses she shares some similar traits with her character. Both of them are vegetarian (for non-violent reasons rather than for health reasons) and highly opinionated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tend to focus on something very attentively before moving on to something else. I think I have a lot of endurance. I don&rsquo;t have very good social skills. Sara&rsquo;s impulsive. She&rsquo;s someone who really, really tries to do the right thing all the time. And I think I do that too. I try to do that. In some ways we are different. I can never do what she does. I think she&rsquo;s very courageous; she&rsquo;s much smarter and braver than I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is obvious is that Fox is very proud of being part of the show and working with its other actors. She even hopes to write an episode one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great thing about working on C.S.I. is all of us work very well together and trust each other&rsquo;s instincts. We are very focused when we work. It&rsquo;s very magical to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation&rsquo; is aired every Wednesday, 9pm, on AXN with repeats on Thursday (noon), and Sunday (11am &amp; 9pm).</p>
