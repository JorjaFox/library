		<p><strong>Jorja Fox<br />
Plays Sara Sidle</strong></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;I am upstaged all the time by pieces of carpet fibre!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox is probably best known for her TV work - she had a starring role on ER as Dr Maggie Doyle and a recurring part on The West Wing as Agent Gina Toscano. On film, she can be found in smaller films such as Dead Funny, Velocity Trap and appears as Catherine Shelby in Memento. CSI&rsquo;s Sara Sidle is a recovering alcoholic who has appeared since the very first show. A dedicated, driven forensic scientist, she nevertheless finds her personal life occasionally affecting her professional career.</p>

<p><strong>You seem to enjoy playing Sara&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I love that I&rsquo;m playing someone who&rsquo;s worlds smarter than I am and that is always a good reason to get out of bed: &ldquo;I went to Harvard and Berkeley and studied physics, nuclear fission&hellip;&rdquo; But there are times where it&rsquo;s not so easy! I was on a roof scene this week for about three hours. They didn&rsquo;t put me on the roof, I was on a set that they built that was about four feet off the ground but I still had to wear a harness, which felt really silly because I&rsquo;m an adult, so there are days where it&rsquo;s really hard work. But, how cool is it that I get paid to do that? It never ceases to amaze me.</p>

<p><strong>Do you feel like the show is more about the crime than the people sometimes?</strong></p>

<p>I am upstaged all the time by pieces of carpet fibre! They&rsquo;ll spend two hours lighting carpet fibre and ten minutes lighting us. I think it&rsquo;s really great, though, because I our hope is that people who like the show will always want to know more about the characters and you reveal it a little bit like snapshots. So I would much rather do that every week than a show where you&rsquo;re just purging constantly. I think the longevity and mystery of it, I think there&rsquo;s still a lot of mystery around a lot of the characters and I&rsquo;d like to believe that that at least partly keeps people tuning in.</p>

<p><strong>Do you enjoy the character work?</strong></p>

<p>I think we all get really excited and also it&rsquo;s kind of scary, especially if you&rsquo;re going some place that the show hasn&rsquo;t gone so much before. I felt I&rsquo;ve been really lucky in that way, I&rsquo;ve got to be the guinea pig a couple of times. So it&rsquo;s amazing and fun and terrifying and I&rsquo;m always just crossing my fingers and hoping that it works. It&rsquo;s been really nice to see a lot of the other characters do that this year and it also makes Sara a little less crazy. Everybody else is having breakdowns!</p>

<p><strong>Is it true you were holding out for more money at the start of Season Five, or was that just rumours?</strong></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t holding out for more money, I merely wanted a raise (laughs). I, who had been spoiled enough to come from ER and West Wing before I came to this show, had only really known that as an example of how things worked, so it&rsquo;s a very normal thing in the television business that if a show is doing really well that every two years, many of the cast, including the crew and other people, will go in and ask for a raise. Anything can happen from that, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen some really dramatic stuff on TV where people really hold out for it, in this case nothing like that happened - they invited George and I not to come to work, and then they changed their minds.</p>

<p><strong>Here comes the science bit&hellip;CSI is loaded with technological terms that the cast have to trip off their tongues at speed every week. How do you handle it?</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to read the scripts too late in the day, they give me the creeps. I used do it a lot before bed because I like to read them straight through and that&rsquo;s the time of the day that it&rsquo;s quiet and the phone stops ringing, but it&rsquo;s also the time that, I&rsquo;ve had nightmares many times!</p>

		<p>As promised, here&rsquo;s my interview with CSI&rsquo;s veggie-lovin&rsquo; babe Jorja Fox. Spoilerphobes, read at your own risk!</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Hi, Jorja.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **Sorry I&rsquo;m a few minutes late. My very good friend, Eric Szmanda, who plays Greg Sanders, just did his last scene of the season, so there was a good three minutes of hugging going on.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: You won&rsquo;t see him now until July?</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **No, I&rsquo;m probably going to see him tomorrow night. He and I are very close. Tomorrow is my wrap day, so I think we&rsquo;re gonna all go out tomorrow night and have drinks after work. He&rsquo;ll probably start drinking today; I&rsquo;ll be waiting until tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: What&rsquo;s going on in your final scene?</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **I can&rsquo;t give anything away, but we have a cliff-hanger at the end of this season that I think you guys are going to have a field day with. All I can say is that it&rsquo;s going to be good and it&rsquo;s going to come completely out of left field. I think everyone&rsquo;s going to end Season 6 with their jaws dropped.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Does it involve anything romantic between Sara and Grissom?</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **I don&rsquo;t kiss and tell. God bless that story line. It&rsquo;s been around since the first episode of Season 1, and Billy and I have known one thing and it&rsquo;s that we never really know when they&rsquo;re going to bring it out; it&rsquo;s always a surprise. So I&rsquo;m not going to give away any details. All I can say is that I think this cliff-hanger will be quite surprising for everybody. If you&rsquo;re a fan of the show, don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Does it involve *</strong>** getting shot?**</p>

<p>**Jorja: <strong>There are two cliff-hangers in the finale, one will involve *</strong>**. There&rsquo;s a melding of cliff-hangers in the last episode, which is rare for our show. We don&rsquo;t do them that much. We don&rsquo;t do cliff-hangers per se, but sometimes we&rsquo;ll throw something really crazy into the mix right before the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Most of my CSI mail is about Sara-Grissom. Fans want you two to get together.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **No kidding? It&rsquo;s funny because Billy and I are always so sure that everyone&rsquo;s just bored to tears with that story line. We&rsquo;ve been sort of beating that horse for six years.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Switching gears, you and I have something in common.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **Really?</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: We&rsquo;re both nominated in PETA&rsquo;s World&rsquo;s Sexiest Vegetarian poll.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **We are?</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Yes. Have you voted yet?</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **No! I didn&rsquo;t even know about this at all. I&rsquo;m so embarrassed.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: If you go to GoVeg.com, you&rsquo;ll see it.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **I&rsquo;ll vote for both of us, like, 20 times. Congratulations!</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Congratulations to you, too. I think we can win.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **If we vote continuously. When do the polls close?</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: In a few weeks.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **Oh, wow. That&rsquo;s a lot of voting.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: I don&rsquo;t know what we win.</strong></p>

<p>**Jorja: **Maybe it&rsquo;s a date with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Maybe. We could go to a vegetarian restaurant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> (Laughs) Totally!</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: You&rsquo;re featured in a new PETA campaign with the slogan &ldquo;Investigate Vegetarianism.&rdquo; How did that come about?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been a member of PETA forever. I was very active when I lived in New York City, which I did for many years. They&rsquo;d have protests and things of that nature, and I was very active in doing stuff like that. And just this year PETA moved to Los Angeles. They have an office in Silver Lake, which is totally exciting for those of us in L.A. And that&rsquo;s sort of how I got in contact with them. And so they approached me with the idea, and I jumped at the chance.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Did you get permission from CSI? The ad leans heavily on your connection to the show.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t really ask for permission; I probably should have. I didn&rsquo;t see that there was anything controversial - or even confrontational - about the ad. I think that as far as PETA&rsquo;s concerned, it&rsquo;s one of their gentler ads. But we&rsquo;ll see. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble. But I somehow doubt it. It&rsquo;s a pretty supportive group around here.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Do you make your costars feel guilty about eating meat?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> That&rsquo;s rarely my style. Billy has just become a vegetarian in the last couple of months.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: Due to your influence?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, his wife has been a vegetarian for a long time and I think it&rsquo;s just a combination of things. He&rsquo;s sort of been on a health kick anyway. And he loves animals.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: What are you doing on your hiatus?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I produced a play in L.A. two years ago called Dear Bernard. It&rsquo;s an original musical and we&rsquo;ve been invited to take the show to London at Riverside Studios this summer. So that&rsquo;s my big summer project. We have a three-week run there. It&rsquo;s a risk, but it was a risk I couldn&rsquo;t pass up.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: How long do you see yourself doing CSI?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Sky&rsquo;s the limit. In about 24 hours I will have completed my 10th consecutive year on prime-time television, starting with ER in 1996. I thought to myself over the years that it would be really cool to do 10 years on TV, and now I&rsquo;m about to hit that mark. So from this point on there&rsquo;s no script. It&rsquo;s unchartered territory.</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello: But you&rsquo;ll be back in the fall, right?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be back. I&rsquo;m getting a little older and there are some other things that I&rsquo;d like to do, so from time to time I think that maybe it&rsquo;s about time to move on and do something different. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger. But I&rsquo;m not ready to let this go.</p>

		<p><strong>Several Of The Actors Reflect On What Makes Them Tick</strong></p>

<p><strong>(CBS)</strong> &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is offering fans a lot more than the usual mix of felonies and forensics this season.</p>

<p>The hit <strong>CBS</strong> drama is also providing unique peeks at the inner workings of the minds of several of the characters.</p>

<p><strong>The Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen</strong> took it even further when she spoke with several of the actors who portray those characters. She also asked about the season&rsquo;s final two episodes, both major cliffhangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you guys first started, six years ago, we knew nothing about (Gil) Grissom, or Catherine (Willows), or Warrick (Brown),&rdquo; Chen remarked. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re finally getting to learn a little bit about what makes you tick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as one, as much as anybody knows what makes them tick, you know,&rdquo; agreed William Petersen, who plays Grissom. &ldquo;&hellip; I mean, uh, if you ask Grissom, he, he doesn&rsquo;t know, exactly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also this season, the ticking time bomb of attraction continued between Grissom and Sara, Chen observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like we all have these alter egos, you know,&rdquo; observed Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle. &ldquo;That started back in season one. And now that it&rsquo;s been six years, I totally do. I have hopes for her and dreams for her, and I get upset for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more Sara than Jorja,&rdquo; Chen observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, no, it&rsquo;s confusing sometimes,&rdquo; Fox responded. &ldquo;Certain times of the year, I&rsquo;ll buy a piece of wardrobe and I&rsquo;ll look at it in the summer and I&rsquo;ll be like, &#8216;Who bought that? Who did&hellip; Oh, right, Sara must have bought that!&lsquo;&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s a strange thing that you go in and out of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last season ended with Nick Stokes, portrayed by George Eads, buried alive &#8212; and this season appeared to follow in that dark tradition, Chen said. There was a murder scene that echoed the Holocaust, another episode in which a woman was sealed alive inside a chimney, and the team even investigated a mass suicide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the word has come down on the Internet,&rdquo; said Gary Dourdan, who plays Warrick Brown. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ve been getting feedback, that&rsquo;s what people like. They like watching the train wreck. They like watching the car accident. They like watching the dark stuff. We can show things on our show, on network television, the bloodiest stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t have a sex scene,&rdquo; he adds with a laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Thursday night&rsquo;s episode, a Las Vegas casino becomes a maze of chases and deceptions after only one man survives the brutal killing of his wife and co-workers.</p>

<p>Dourdan told Chen with a chuckle that the soundstage t is so realistic, &ldquo;When you walk on the set, it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re in a casino. (laugh) They had to walk around and tell the extras, &#8216;Don&rsquo;t put money in the slot machines! You won&rsquo;t get it back! They do not work!&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>Chen notes the actors couldn&rsquo;t be happier that &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is heading into its final two episodes with two cliffhangers on tap, even though it&rsquo;s not something &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; usually does.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more you kind of just to not make it, uh, to not get in a rut, you know, to give it some life and to give it some change,&rdquo; said Eads, &ldquo;we have such a talented cast here that to play emotion is something we all kind of are, our chops are kind of dripping to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Added Marg Helgenberger, who plays Catherine Willows, &ldquo;I guess season seven, I&rsquo;m hoping, anyway, seven and eight, will be really, you know, just a continuation of that and be lots of arcs of various characters and intermingling, and, and just so it just, I think it makes it more, uh, textured and more rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is riding high in the ratings as it heads into season seven &hellip; something the cast members didn&rsquo;t dare imagine when they took their first case.</p>

<p>Said Peterson, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever put that into the, the ethos, that somehow or another, you&rsquo;re gonna be around for seven years. You know, you just hope to make a good show today. It&rsquo;s a big crap shoot, and we happened to roll the right dice. I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Things I noticed looking at the CSI picture: Nick has a cut on his neck, the dead body has a police badge in its pocket, and the bench says &ldquo;GG + ?&rdquo;. Am I on to anything? &#8212; Jaime</p>

<p><strong>Ausiello:</strong> Not sure what the cut on Nick&rsquo;s neck means, but the badge is definitely a big clue and, based on the hints Jorja Fox dropped in last week&rsquo;s AA, I&rsquo;m betting the &ldquo;GG + ?&rdquo; has to do with Gil engaging in some hanky-panky with someone.</p>

		<p><strong>Trading forensic evidence in for a kickball craze</strong></p>

<p>&#8216;CSI&rsquo;s Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda have an interesting way of unwinding after a long day on the set &#8212; engaging in a good ole&rsquo; game of kickball. Fox and Szmanda are members of the World Adult Kickball Association, playing for the Royal Blue Balls team. The pair played during a semifinal game last night at a field in North Hollywood, and TMZ was there to capture it.</p>
