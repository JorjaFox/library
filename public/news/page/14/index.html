		<p>title: Radio Times Its not unheard of in the annals of crime drama for a member of a tight-knit law-enforcement team suddenly to find the tables turned. One of our heroes is a murder suspect themselves. How will they prove their innocence?</p>

<p>Tonight these classic woes befall poor Sara Sidle when a man chats her up in a hotel dining room and is then found dead the next day, with Saras hair in his shower drain. It couldnt have come at a worse time, either  shes already unbalanced by the latest twists in her relationship with king-over-the-water Gil Grissom. All her colleagues are treating her like a liar. Nice to know who your friends are.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THIS PROGRAMME</strong></p>

<p><sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>22</sub>. Sara celebrates her birthday in a hotel with recent acquaintance Taylor Wynard, who is found dead the next morning having been stabbed with a steak knife. After Finn sends her home to get some rest, Sara gets the shock of her life when she opens her dishwasher and finds the murder weapon inside, while the team discovers a necklace belonging to her behind the victim&rsquo;s bed and records from her key card indicate she didn&rsquo;t return to her room when she said she did. Drama, starring Jorja Fox.</p>

		<p>How will CSI shake things up to conclude its 13th season? By putting one of their own in jeopardy, thats how.</p>

<p>On tonights finale Elisabeth Harnoiss Morgan Brody will go undercover (as a hooker, no less) and - SPOILER ALERT! - she may find herself in harms way.</p>

<p>In this exclusive Q&amp;A, actress tells me how the episode is laid out, who shed love to have more scenes with next season and a lot more&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>TVF:</strong> Would you like to see more of a romance part of the show or do you think its better left as like maybe teasing and little elements here and there?</p>

<p><strong>EH:</strong> I think theyve already made some bold choices by giving so much character driven material to people like me and my character and Lisa Shues character have all gotten incredible personal storylines as well as Jorja [Fox] and Eric [Szmanda], everybodys been giving it much more of their own life to the show in this season. So I think that, that opens the door.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>TVF:</strong> Assuming you survive the cliff hanger, who would you like to see Morgan kind of interact with a lot more maybe she hasnt?</p>

<p><strong>EH:</strong> I think apparently I would love to work with some of the women more. I understand why but theres only three of us so theres a lot more men on the show. A lot of our chemistry in our personal lives in terms of us becoming friends and just having things in common I think has sort of helped the writers find the directions to go concerning a storylineit doesnt hurt that if Morgan is going to have a crush on Erics character that they actually are good friends and we really like each other. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>But I think that the people that I really would want to work with more than I have thus far are Lisa Shue and Jorja. I had a little bit with Jorja and I had a little bit with Lisa but I would love for us girls to have to band together for a really cool power girl episode. Not a Charlies Angels kind of thing but an episode that requires that it has to be them that come to the forefront. Weve all said that we would love to have that kind of an episode for the three of us because we all really like each other and were all very opinionated strong women.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle in <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, a crime drama series that has more than 60 million viewers worldwide. Here, she tells <em>TV Choice</em> how it feels to have such an amazing fan base. But she also reflects on her other roles in <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>, and talks about her work as a conservationist campaigner</strong></p>

<p>**<em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> is currently in its 13th season. So how have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?<br />
**The biggest compliment is that last year we were the number one show in the world again. So I have to say a big thank you to all our international fans. Our ratings have also been going up this year in America. It&rsquo;s really rare for ratings to dip, then for them to go back up. Especially after all this time. Honestly, every week we go to bed wondering how we can keep on entertaining people and keep people watching.</p>

<p>**<em>Pirates Of The Caribbean</em> producer Jerry Bruckheimer is a co-creator of the show. Is he still heavily involved in its development?<br />
**Yes, I think he&rsquo;s got a creative force in all the projects he&rsquo;s a part of. We were the first TV show that his company had produced. And it&rsquo;s hard to believe that, after 13 years, we have much of the original creative team still on board.</p>

<p>**Your big break came in <em>ER</em> in the mid-Nineties. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?<br />
**For me, it was the first time that people were really going to see my work. So I was scared senseless. On the night I got the job, I honestly almost drove to Mexico, because I was so terrified. I nearly told them I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. But it was very thrilling for me to work with people who were so talented. And a great honour.</p>

<p>**And then you joined <em>The West Wing</em>&hellip;<br />
**</span><em>The West Wing</em> was one of the most special moments in my life. I never thought that someone like myself would get to be part of the political process. It was an election year in 2000 in the States, so I found myself in places in Washington DC, and I never imagined that would happen.</p>

<p>**Have you also produced a documentary about the plight of elephants in Thailand?<br />
**</span>Yes, it&rsquo;s called <em>How I Became An Elephant</em>, and it&rsquo;s about a 14 year-old-girl who travels from California to Thailand to see an elephant. It&rsquo;s a conservation film, and a film about habitat. I teamed up with a film-maker here in the US who&rsquo;d been living in Thailand since 2004. It&rsquo;s in film festivals right now. We&rsquo;re looking at a couple of companies [for distribution] but you can always look for the movie. We have a website called howibecameanelephant.com  you can find out where it&rsquo;s showing there.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong>, who plays Sara Sidle, is proud to be part of the planet&rsquo;s favourite show</p>

<p><strong>This week, the CSI team is spooked by a case that brings back memories of their murdered colleague, Warrick Brown. How does that store compare to the rest of this series?</strong></p>

<p>This season is unique, because almost every episode impacts on one of the characters in a personal level. In an episode we shot recently, Sara&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend comes to town, and she has to grapple with that. For her, there&rsquo;s always a steady theme of love &hellip; or not! She&rsquo;s married to someone she&rsquo;s deeply in love with, but she doesn&rsquo;t see him very much.</p>

<p><strong>Of course, her husband is former colleague Gil Grissom. Were you showed when they ended up together?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the bigger surprise for me was that I returned to the show! I came back in the eighth season, when Gil was leaving, to tell that storyline. I never imagined that I would be invited to return to the show, and of course, when I was asked, I couldn&rsquo;t say no, because it&rsquo;s been such an amazing ride. I knew that Gil and Sara were going to take off, but I didn&rsquo;t know that Sara was ever going to come back.</p>

<p><strong>How have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the biggest compliment is that last year we were the most popular show in the world again. So I have to say a big thank you to all our overseas fans!</p>

<p>**You&rsquo;ve also starred in <em>The West Wing</em> but your first big break came in <em>ER</em>. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?<br />

I nearly told them I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. But it was a great honour for me to work with people who were so talented.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;CSI Files:&ldquo;&rsquo; The season is winding down. What are some of your favorite moments from this season? Anything you would have liked to do, but werent able to?</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Daley:&ldquo;&rsquo; I was happy we brought the dog on the team. Im a real dog lover (as is over half the staff) and Sam was great in his episode. SPOILER: You may even see him in mine!</p>

<p>I personally loved what we did with Saras character this year. I know Ill lose some GSRs off my Twitter now, but &ldquo;&lsquo;Jorja Fox&rdquo;&rsquo; is an amazing actress and that was an incredible performance. Its time for Sara to become her own character, and not be defined by an off screen Grissom.</p>

<p>Also, I was glad to see &ldquo;&lsquo;David Berman&rdquo;&rsquo; get to show his comedy chops in &ldquo;Dead of the Class.&rdquo; That scene in the autopsy was brilliant, and I give Tom Mularz real props for that. Its been a great year all around. Im really proud of how strong the show is in season 13.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;CSI Files:&ldquo;&rsquo; Going into these final episodes, what can viewers expect? How is the finale looking?</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Daley:&ldquo;&rsquo; Heres one teaser  you may see someone we havent seen in years return in the finale (cryptic enough?)</p>
