		<p><strong>Question: Jorja Fox&rsquo;s last &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; episode just aired, and that got me to thinking about all the brouhaha back when the relationship between Grissom and Sara was revealed in the Season 6 finale. At the time, there were dire predictions that this was the end of the rope for the series. It had become a soap, turned a corner, jumped the shark, etc. Looking back at it now, do you think that the romance &ndash; its reveal, and the way it was woven into Seasons 7 and 8 &ndash; was a detriment to the show? An asset? My personal opinion is that the creators did a very nice job of keeping the relationship believable and not letting it overtake the procedural nature that is the show&rsquo;s hallmark. That said, Season 7 was perhaps one of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;&rsquo;s best, not because of the romance storyline but because of the writing (the &ldquo;miniature killer&rdquo; and Liev Schreiber arcs) and the artistic gambles the creators took: dead bodies that spoke, a &ldquo;monster movie&rdquo;-style episode, the incredibly cute &ldquo;clip show&rdquo; featuring the lab rats. &ndash; Sandra S.</strong></p>

<p>Matt Roush: Couldn&rsquo;t agree more. &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is more nimble than most at balancing the procedural storylines (the real draw on this and nearly every crime franchise) with the personal subplots, which rarely intrude or overtake the series. Not only is &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; among the best of its type at telling clever and creepy crime stories (last season was among its most sustained), but the unusual relationship between Grissom and Sara ranks high as well in terms of the subtlety and complexity of the writing and performances of both William Petersen and Jorja Fox. Rare for this sort of show, the relationship didn&rsquo;t cheapen the series but made the characters that much more intriguing. Allowing Sara to exit with dignity, while leaving the door open for the character to reappear eventually, was also a smart move.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this brief interchange, crime scene investigator Sara Sidle made her first appearance on the CBS hit show, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Yesterday, she made her final appearance. After a tumultuous seven years on the show, actress Jorja Fox finally packed up her fingerprint kit.</p>

<p>Fox enjoyed a long run of success with the show as a materials and element analysis specialist who was originally brought in during the first season by Gil Grissom (actor William Petersen) to do an internal affairs investigation. Sidle ended up staying in Las Vegas for the next seven years (give or take a few episodes in season eight), developing close friendships with her team members and a romantic relationship in season five with Grissom.</p>

<p>Prior to last night&rsquo;s episode, Sidle had been kidnapped by the &ldquo;Miniature Killer&rdquo; as a terrifying message to Grissom, nearly killed, and saved with only dehydration and a broken arm as testament to her story.</p>

<p>Since then, Sara has been in the background as the season continues. I thought this was strange as she&rsquo;s my favorite CSI character (after all, I played her in Rocky Horror last year!) and her absence did not go unnoticed. Originally, I believed her absence to be due to the shift change which she had to do because of her relationship with Grissom, as the show centers on the grave shift. Only after I read the article in Entertainment Weekly did I understand what was happening. Sara was being phased out.</p>

<p>Grissom&rsquo;s proposal three weeks ago struck viewers as untimely if the lanky brunette was truly going leave the show. Maybe she would stay. Maybe this was a publicity stunt like when co-star George Eades (Nick Stokes on CSI) and her were fired by CBS for three days. But last night, it happened. Jorja Fox officially vacated her role as Sara Sidle.</p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;d like to warn all readers of spoilers ahead, so please if you don&rsquo;t want to know what happened yet, stop reading. I sat on my bed, anticipating what was about to come on my television screen at 9 pm sharp. It began with a knife cutting the threads which held Sara&rsquo;s name badge to her CSI vest and the aforementioned character holding the blade, slicing her own name off of the fabric. The scenes with Sara were intercut with the &ldquo;main&rdquo; case of the episode, Catherine and Nick&rsquo;s defenestration. It was a little disappointing, since on her last episode, she should be the center of attention.</p>

<p>Sara&rsquo;s dialogue in the first half hour was contrived, clichÃ©d, and to be quite honest, a little boring. Thankfully, she woke up and began to speak normally when she got into the case. The major twist in the episode was the reappearance of former sibling suspects Marlon and Hannah West from the season six episode, &ldquo;The Unusual Suspect&rdquo; in Catherine&rsquo;s case. Sara demands to take over the case, as the original one from season six had haunted her since then. Needless to say, what Sara discovered further pushed her to resign from the crime lab.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how annoying the little hints that the writers dropped within the episode of Sara&rsquo;s departure were. One of Hannah&rsquo;s lines, which ran, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Sara? You&rsquo;re different then you used to be,&rdquo; was only one of the obvious moments. Others were extreme close-ups on Sara in times of high emotion and even one of her own lines when she said that the CSIs would be back to collect the bodies of an abusive couple within a month because there&rsquo;s nothing they could do to change things.</p>

<p>Sadly, Jorja&rsquo;s last performance as Sara Sidle seemed very unnatural and the whole episode was not up to the usual standard of the show. However, at least they gave Jorja what she said wanted in an interview three years ago. She kissed William Petersen on the show. Ah, I love those moments. After this touching moment, the show cut back to the beginning of the episode with the removal of her name tag. She wrote &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; on her vest where here name previously was, and threw the tag away. And then she left, leaving Grissom a note telling him how much she loves him but that she was leaving Las Vegas via voice over.</p>

<p>At least they didn&rsquo;t kill her off like previous characters. This writer wishes Jorja good luck in her future endeavors and hopes that she&rsquo;ll avoid the David Caruso post-NYPD Blues curse. And maybe, she&rsquo;ll return to CSI someday, even if it&rsquo;s only as a cameo.</p>

		<p>Which is the better way to go out, with a bang or a whimper? Unlike its Miami-based counterpart, &ldquo;<strong>CSI&rdquo;</strong> has never been about the bang. The flagship show&rsquo;s characters are more cerebral, its sets dressed in somber blues. It may have made for better storytelling to have Sara Sidle die at the hands of the Miniature Killer, but her actual departure fit better with the show&rsquo;s sensibilities.</p>

<p>[Sara didn&rsquo;t have the sawdust to handle spoilers.]</p>

<p>We open with Sara alone in the dark, cutting at something. The background lights to reveal the LVPD locker room, and then we&rsquo;re at a stereotypical college dorm. Not stereotypical is the girl falling to her death.</p>

<p>Want to see your favorite investigators this week? Too bad. They get less time than when Jack Malone stormed through last week. Instead, we&rsquo;re all about Sara. To that end, the falling girl is connected to Marlon West, the killer from a few years ago whose super-genius little sister threw enough doubt into a jury to ruin Sara&rsquo;s murder case. Now in college, Marlon was dating Kira (this week&rsquo;s corpse) until a very public breakup that ended in a fistfight with Kira&rsquo;s new boy.</p>

<p>Supergenius sister Hannah is teaching and doing graduate studies at the same college, and no points for guessing she stymies Sara&rsquo;s investigation again. Unfortunately for Marlon, a chip of his tooth is found in Kira&rsquo;s hand, and Sara figures out (thanks to photos that may as well have giant flashing &ldquo;Clue&rdquo; signs) that Hannah took the chip from the fistfight, drugged Kira&rsquo;s adult-use lubricant, planted the chip in the girl&rsquo;s hand and then pushed her out the window. Why? Because Marlon was drifting away &#8212; also known as developing a normal life &#8212; and Hannah couldn&rsquo;t stand not having him close by at all times.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think she thought her cunning plan all the way through. While jail may indeed keep Marlon close, it also proves to be a convenient spot for suicide. Sara gets to destroy Hannah with the news.</p>

<p>Oh, there was a micro-subplot about an abused woman that served only to contrast Ronnie&rsquo;s optimism with Sara&rsquo;s cynicism. Feel free to ignore it.</p>

<p>Gil_240 Anyway, at the end Sara pens a very sweet letter for Grissom and then leaves with no set destination. Poor Gil is devastated &#8212; William Petersen&rsquo;s one expression conveys more emotion than Sara has all season.</p>

<p>Really, we see Sara isn&rsquo;t so different from Hannah. Both are brilliant but socially inept and so tend toward overly dramatic but ill-conceived gestures. That was my interpretation, anyway, and for me the heartfelt feelings in the letter were absolutely invalidated by the fact that Sara would rather just run away with no plan.</p>

		<p>For months, we&rsquo;ve all known it was coming - the departure of a beloved <strong>&ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;</strong> (8 p.m., KRQE News 13) character.</p>

<p>Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) makes her last appearance in tonight&rsquo;s episode, and mostly this makes me sad.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s an interesting and complex character who truly bonds with people. I like her eccentricities, and while her hair will never be as cute as Catherine&rsquo;s (Marg Helgenberger), she still manages to look good while knee deep in gross stuff.</p>

<p>The only plus I see in her leaving is that I&rsquo;ll no longer be subjected to the stomach-churning romance between Sara and Grissom (William Petersen).</p>

<p>Seriously, the two of them together easily make the list of worst TV couples ever. They&rsquo;re even more disgusting than Wilhemina and Bradford on &ldquo;Ugly Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s always hope that with a little bit of cold, hard cash as an incentive, Sara could reappear, because at least she&rsquo;s not going to die some sort of icky death.</p>

<p>Tonight, freakishly smart Hannah (Juliette Goglia) returns to back up her brother, Marlon (Douglas Smith), on yet another violent crime.</p>

<p>The case leads Sara to question her future as a CSI.</p>

<p>She should have started rethinking her profession during that whole &ldquo;likely death at the hands of the miniature killer&rdquo; storyline, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>

<p>So long, Sara. It&rsquo;s been nice knowing you for eight grisly years.</p>

		<p><strong>Fans put through ringer on Jorja Fox&rsquo;s farewell episode</strong></p>

<p>Do the creators of &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; enjoy torturing their fans?</p>

<p>Jorja Fox&rsquo;s last appearance as a regular (Wednesday night at 9 on WBZ, Ch. 4) was bound to be difficult. &ldquo;Goodbye &amp; Good Luck&rdquo; is excruciating. Given the final moments, the title seems cruelly ironic.</p>

<p>CBS has asked that I refrain from any potential spoilers. If the network were serious, it would have gagged both Fox and the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; producers weeks ago. It&rsquo;s no secret that Fox&rsquo;s investigator Sara Sidle lives to see another day.</p>

<p>As to what kind of day she&rsquo;ll be waking up to, well, that&rsquo;s something viewers will be pondering for some time.</p>

<p>In Wednesday night&rsquo;s episode, Sara shows obvious signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, a result of her recent kidnapping.</p>

<p>As a battered wife stands in her blood-spattered living room - with a knife stuck in her back - Sara uncharacteristically shows no concern.</p>

<p>When Ronnie (Jessica Lucas) wants to intervene in the case of the brawling couple, Sara replies, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back for her body next month. Or his. Or both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The case of a co-ed pushed from her dorm room brings Sara back into contact with killer Marlon West (Douglas Smith) and his pint-sized prodigy of a sister, Hannah (Juliette Goglia). Marlon is a student at the college; Hannah is teaching and proves to be just as much a roadblock as she was the first time they crossed paths and helped Marlon escape justice. Sara is determined to right that wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going to muddy the waters this time,&rdquo; Sara tells the twerp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;d know if I had?&rdquo; Hannah replies.</p>

<p>Hannah, improbably, seems to be the only one to realize Sara is imploding emotionally.</p>

<p>At a key moment late in the episode, Sara walks into the CSI offices and plants a kiss on Gil Grissom (William Petersen). It&rsquo;s a moment that will make devoted fans of the show squeal - until they realize, as Gil does, too late, that Sara is saying farewell.</p>

<p>The top-rated show about forensic detectives made the Sara/Grissom relationship the greatest mystery of the series. Viewers followed a faint trail of crumbs over the years that led to the reveal of their relationship. Sara&rsquo;s moments tonight with Grissom are, in the tradition of the series, short and maddeningly frustrating.</p>

<p>Fox decided not to renew her contract, but she deserved a better sendoff than this. The nature of her departure will stab at the hearts of viewers. But there remains a chance she could return.</p>

<p>Someday.</p>
