<h2 id="synopsis:e0bb2da32034331e574d225af8a8395e">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A couple goes to a party with the passcode of &lsquo;decadance.&rsquo; As one might suspect, itâs a party for wealthy dilletants. As one may not guess, it was a private auction for rare wine, held at the Vogel mansion. In the wine celler, some expensive wine is revealed to a party goer, who says heâll pay anything for it. Of course, that doesnât work out when the seller is found dead in a wine barrel, shot at by some young punks in an alley, well decomposed and grotesque. No ID was found, save cufflinks with the initials &lsquo;JD,&rsquo; and was killed by a small calliblar gunshot. His last meal of whale sushi was served by a cook who was regularly known to have served whale sushi at the home of Albert Vogel. Vogel ID&rsquo;s the cufflinks as belonging to Jack Davari, and notes that he argued with Marc Ratelle recently.</p>

<p>Ratelle, while the CSIs are looking into his background, breaks into Vogel&rsquo;s wine celler and smashes all of the wine of the same kind he&rsquo;d intended to buy from Davari. Turns out the wine in Vogel&rsquo;s was all faked, and Ratelle destroyed it. The CSIs prove this when the MassSpec detects radioactive isotopes in the supposed 1930s wine. Ratelle has an alibi, as does the person who bought the wine, Dr. Jonah Drake.</p>

<p>It turns out Davari had been mass producing fakes of expensive wines, with the help of Tom Scolla, a &lsquo;security&rsquo; guard to regularly transports expensive wines. The two had been faking the wines for three years, and claimed to have had Drake on the hook for more. Scolla, however, as an alabi: he was at a club. Interestingly, Scolla had given bone marrow to a cancer victim, his sister, who happened to be newly engaged to Jonah Drake. Samantha Wilson (nee Scolla) was in on the grift as well, but had fallen in love with Drake, and murdered Davari over an argument trying to get out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mac Taylor visits from New York to surprise his girlfriend, in Vegas on business, only to find her mising, her hotel room tossed, and blood trace left everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:efd844fc3eefb52198efa520782741c5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night in Las Vegas, when Theresa Shea, a news anchor for KVKC died on set, on a closed set. While presenting the news on the storm, the power went out. When it came back up, Theresa was dead of a single puncture wound to the back of the neck. No one else was in the room.</p>

<p>Sara and D.B. Russell are the leads on the case, but it&rsquo;s an all-hands-on-deck case, especially since almost everyone has a motive. The autopsy reveals the knife went in at the perfect spot to sever the brainstem, meaning the killer was either really lucky, or really good.</p>

<p>The power outage was caused by a transform that exploded, which isn&rsquo;t unheard of, though the traces of explosives imply it was done on purpose, as part of a plan to kill Theresa. The temporary co-anchor, Ella St. James, was reporting from the field at the time, only her video was proven to haven been taken at a different time in a different location. Ella admits she was in a different location, but it&rsquo;s because she was having an affair with her camera man (who confesses as well). Ella knew that Theresa was working on a big, secret, case, which the CSIs find &hellip; stuck to the walls in Theresa&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p>The case was all about a series of warehouse fires in the furniture district from 1996, which were all unsolved, and yet resemble the device used to blow up the transformer the night of Theresa&rsquo;s murder. They also resemble the devices made by a demolitions expert turned motivational speaker, who had been killed via a stab wound to the back of the neck, just like Theresa, and his devices were all the same type as the ones used in the arson 17 years ago, and the transformer from the night before.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not until after the CSIs engage in a game, to see who could kill Theresa, that they peg it on the producer, Fred Paulson. He had been doing favors to friends who helped him with the arson years ago, which he&rsquo;d done to make his name in news. When Theresa found out, he killed her.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:efd844fc3eefb52198efa520782741c5">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>While working on the case and chasing rabbits, Sara puts off calls from Grissom, avoiding him because she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk. And he &lsquo;needs to talk.&rsquo; She avoids the call once while heading down to Theresa&rsquo;s autopsy, looking troubled. When DB calls her while she&rsquo;s in autopsy, she hesitates, worried it&rsquo;s Grissom again.</p>

<p>At Theresa&rsquo;s house, Sara mentions that her place looks similar when she brings work home, even though she&rsquo;s married. That is until she sees Theresa&rsquo;s bedroom, which does not resemble the Sidle/Grissom home.</p>

<p>Both Russell and Finn notice Sara&rsquo;s a little off, Finn when Sara ignores another call from Grissom, and gently ask her about it, though she rebuffs their inquiries. The third time Grissom calls, Sara is with DB in his office, and he leaves to give her the privacy to answer.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:efd844fc3eefb52198efa520782741c5">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still knows quite a bit about baseball (likely from her marriage).<br /></li>
<li>Sara brings work home with her, when she goes home and doesn&rsquo;t stay up all night chasing rabbits.<br /></li>
<li>Doc Robbins notes that Sara&rsquo;s instincts are always good.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:efd844fc3eefb52198efa520782741c5">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>David Phillips:</strong> When we disceted frogs, when I was in high school biology, you&rsquo;d pith it, by sticking a pin right here. The frog would get all <em>makes a face</em>. None of the girls in class wanted to do it, so they asked me to. I became known as the &lsquo;designated pither.&rsquo;<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I would have gone with &lsquo;relief pither.&rsquo;<br />
<strong>Phillips:</strong> That&rsquo;s better.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Russell:</strong> Looks like it pays more to report on crime that it does to solve crime.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You could say that about any job. Except crime. I heard it doesn&rsquo;t pay.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> Heh heh.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I know when I bring work home, it usually finds its way into the bedroom.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> Yeah but you&rsquo;re not single, you&rsquo;re married.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>pause</em> Yeah I am. But &hellip; My place? Often looks a lot like this.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Finn</strong> You must be running on fumes. You should go home!<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Home is where the coded notebook is. <em>sees call from Grissom, sends to voicemail</em><br />
<strong>Finn</strong> Have you talked to him since the NTSB guy?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Nothing happened with NTSB.<br />
<strong>Finn</strong> How come you can&rsquo;t pick up the phone?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Because I feel like when I do, I&rsquo;m going to be very sad when I hang up.<br />
<strong>Finn</strong> How do you know?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> &lsquo;Cause he wants to talk.<br />
<strong>Finn</strong> Do you want some help?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Oh that&rsquo;s &hellip; really nice. You should go home, have some fun.<br />
<strong>Finn</strong> This is fun! I&rsquo;m really good at crosswords.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Yeah. Okay.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> So we&rsquo;re looking at a locked room mystery, tucked into an enigma, wrapped in dyamite paper.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> You can say that again&hellip;. Hey, Sara, let me ask you something. You doing alright?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I&rsquo;m fine.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> You just seemed a little bit &hellip; down. When we were at Theresa&rsquo;s place.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Um. I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; A woman married to her career, without much to show for it. It&rsquo;s a little depressing.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> Yeah. I don&rsquo;t mean to pry&ndash;<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Pause right there.<br />
<strong>Russell:</strong> I know I&rsquo;m supposed to be your boss, separation of church and state&ndash;<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> No no no! Hit pause with the remote and back it up a little bit.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Hello<br />
<strong>Grissom:</strong> You&rsquo;ve been hard to get a hold of.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Yeah. Um. I&rsquo;m so sorry. How are you?<br />
<strong>Grissom:</strong> I&rsquo;m okay. Is, uh, now a good time?</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:7bab60e851385c9764ad4542d9baffcc">Synopsis</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively slow night for the CSIs, until a plane crashes at Tresser Park, a mile away from the Strip. NTSB Investigator Doug Wilson is brought in to help work the case. The plane took off from Las Vegas airport, headed to Chicago, but cited an unspecified emergency. Then there was radio silence, and the plane just missed running into a tower at the Mediterranean Hotel before crashing.</p>

<p>The pilot, Keith Mannheim, didn&rsquo;t submit a passenger manifest (not required for a plan his size), so the three additional bodies found in the crash are unknown. The pilots business partner (Dalton Burke, also his life partner of 15 years), is distraught, and had no idea there was anyone else on the plane. One of the bodies on the plane belonged to Charles Harrigan, who had a vendetta against the Mediterranean, which makes the CSIs suspect a revenge attack.</p>

<p>A gun found on the plane initially hints that there was a shooting and encourages the initial theory, but when the flight recorder is found, they determine there was catastrophic pressure loss in the cabin. Investigations on the door shows the seal was tampered with from the outside by someone intimately familiar with planes. Now the hijacking looks like a murder, and since the pilot was the only person expected to be on the plane, either he or the plane itself is the likely target.</p>

<p>Tool marks and paint transfers on the cabin door match the tools used by Hal, the regular mechanic for the company. The charter owed him around $6000, however. Hal was out of town, and could not have tampered with the plane, so someone took his tools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the gun&rsquo;s owner is identified as Jeffery Forsythe, alive, and explains he loaned the gun to a colleague, Grant Abbot, a criminal lawyer who specializes in cases with violent offenders. Said colleague was headed home to Chicago for some time off, following threats to his life. The Jane Doe on the plane is also identified as Jordan Lowell, a woman with a potential paternity DNA test. Of course, things get even more confused when the pilot is found floating in a pool, leaving the CSI&rsquo;s wondering just who they found in the cockpit of the plane.</p>

<p>The body is identified as a stripper named Thor, who claimed he was moving in with his boyfriend Keith, the pilot. This is news to Dalton, who protests his innocence, having lost everything in that crash, including the man he loved. Video of the sabotage is blocked by a fuel truck, but they&rsquo;re able to make out the coveralls, which belong to Hal, the mechanic. DNA from the coveralls exonerate Hal and Dalton.</p>

<p>Jordan&rsquo;s DNA test cannot be recovered, but the fact that she only has two swabs leads the CSIs to determine she was looking for her <em>own</em> father. Jordan&rsquo;s father was dead, but she had a half-sister, Helen, who is in semi-comatose state, where she is no longer aware of her surroundings, following a car accident over 40 years ago. The home, Tranquil Hours, received millions of dollars from Jordan and Helen&rsquo;s father. Surprisingly, DNA shows Helen and Jordan aren&rsquo;t sisters, but DB suspects that the real surprise is that someone is posing as Helen.</p>

<p>Back at Tranquil Hours, Helen has been moved to critical care, her room cleaned with bleach, and her doctor, Dr. O&rsquo;Keefe, has called in sick. They find a fingerprint, naming fake-Helen as Marsha Forsythe, and the DNA comes back and connects the fake Helen with whomever sabotaged the plane; Jeffery Forsythe, the lawyer who loaned his gun to his coworker who was on the plane. Forsythe was also a pilot.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:7bab60e851385c9764ad4542d9baffcc">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>While Sara is public about having worked with Doug before, she does not disclose to her coworkers exactly how close they once were. Doug is tangentially aware Sara married her boss (and manages to make that a teasing dig at her), while Sara is seemingly unaware Doug split with his wife (also making that a dig at him). While they work together, their old camaraderie appears.</p>

<p>Only when Grissom calls, and Sara lets it go to voicemail in front of Finn, does some of the truth come out. Sara is feeling a bit of a strain with the long distance relationship, and having her ex, Doug, in town is weird. Finn asks if it will remain weird, to which Sara says it has to.</p>

<p>When Doug asks Sara and Grissom out to dinner, and then just Sara, she asks him to not do &lsquo;this.&rsquo; He backs off, but tells her she deserves to be happy.</p>

<strong>Wilson</strong> Okay.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:381e6932a1a6f6a536e7028fb0119123">Synopsis</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a busy night in Vegas and the CSIs are working the Strip with the police to help keep the peace. Nick bags a hooker and a drug dealer, while Sara finds a drugged out kid wearing a stuffed horse head. Then they&rsquo;re both called to the scene of a guy swinging his father&rsquo;s severed head around outside a casino. The head is fake, but in the chase to arrest him, the CSIs find Keith Dobson shot dead in a car.</p>

<p>The blood on the fake head was real pigs blood, and the video pranksters passed right by the car where the dead man was found. The CSIs collect the video camera, but his cohort, Lydia, is found dead nearby the video camera drop point.</p>

<p>The hooker, Chastity, was in possession of the engagement ring Jim Brass gave his (now) ex-wife, and had last been seen in Ellie&rsquo;s (his daughter&rsquo;s) possession. The ring was bought from Ellie, who is prostituting and now going by Jersey. Chastity&rsquo;s stolen debit card was also used to rent the car the dead man (Keith) was found in. Chastity had been hired by Keith and someone else.</p>

<p>The accidental ringleader behind the evening&rsquo;s mayhem was Bobby Reed, son of a city attorney, who was pushing drugs (that a transvestite was muleing), trading with another drug dealer, and hiring hookers. Chastity confesses her pimp (Roland Zaal, a local drug lord) had her keeping tabs on Bobby, and suspects Roland accidentally killed Keith when Chastity and Bobby left him in the car. Bobby&rsquo;s father explains that Keith is Bobby&rsquo;s roommate, and the transvestite was Josh, Bobby&rsquo;s cousin. Bobby&rsquo;s father convinces him to come in, and thus save Bobby from street justice.</p>

<p>The gun behind the killing was printed on a 3-D printer, owned by Roland Zaal, however trace of it was found on the hands of a, presumed, tourist witness, Anthony Paak. They trap Paak, but he won&rsquo;t turn on Zaal, and the printer can&rsquo;t be found. Chastity skips town before things get worse, but leaves Brass the ring.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:381e6932a1a6f6a536e7028fb0119123">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara doesn&rsquo;t like working the street, and seems much more comfortable back in the lab.</p>

<p>The merry prankster calls her Detective Seagull, though Sara corrects him. When she arranges with his ex-girlfriend and cohort, Lydia, to drop the camera off in a newspaper dumpster. Sara does wonder why she still trusts people so much.</p>

<h2 id="quotes:381e6932a1a6f6a536e7028fb0119123">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I never had to patrol the streets like this. I mean, not even when I was a CSI 1.<br />
<strong>Sgt. Weiss</strong> It is a little crazy. Full moon tonight.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You know, not to discount the crazy, but no lunar affect on human behavior has ever been established.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> This grass ain&rsquo;t hay.</p>
