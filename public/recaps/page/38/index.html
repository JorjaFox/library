<h2 id="synopsis:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In the conclusion of &ldquo;A Bullet Runs Through It (Part 1)&rdquo;, the detectives and CSI follow the questions of who shot officer Bell, who shot the young boy on his bicycle, and why would a car open fire on a police squad car.</p>

<p>The criminals opened fire on the cop car to distract them from the car the police had originally intended to pull over. Having seen a man strong-arm a pregnant woman into a car, the police had signaled them to pull over, not knowing they were really trafficking drugs. To get the heat off the drug mules, the other car opened fire and led the police away. One of the shooters died while waiting on an ambulance, while two others were killed at the scene. One died in an alley, having thrown his gun onto a roof, only to have it slide back down into his hand and thus appear armed to the police.</p>

<p>One shooter got away, and did indeed kill the young boy for his bicycle to get away.</p>

<p>The final answer is that Jim Brass shot officer Bell. During the fire fight, both men stood up. Bell was hit in the chest, but had on body armor. The shot turned him and Brass, who was shooting across Bell&rsquo;s car (in violation of protocol) accidently hit Bell.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Early in the episode, Sofia Curtis comes to unburden herself to Grissom, who repeatedly asks her not to tell him. Sofia is on administrative leave and shouldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone on the force, which is hard since most of her friends are cops, including her mother. As Sofia talks over Grissom&rsquo;s objections, Sara arrives and reinforces Grissom&rsquo;s statement of how Sofia shouldn&rsquo;t be there, talking to them. Sofia spits back that Sara doesn&rsquo;t have many friends outside the force, and Sara offers the name of a police psychologist.</p>

<p>While hunting for the bullet that killed Bell in the alley, Grissom swoops by and asks Sara to work with him, saying it&rsquo;ll be fun. Sara goes along, and seems only mildly annoyed by Grissom&rsquo;s normal quiz and games attitude. Based on the information that there was red clay on the gun of the shooter killed in the alley, and eye-witnesses claimed he&rsquo;d been unarmed while the cops said otherwise, Grissom reconstruced the situation. Sara demonstrates how the shooter threw the gun up and how he caught it when the gun slid back down.</p>

<p>Finally, Sara and Nick assist Grissom in reconstructing the shooting of Bell, using lasers and dummies. Sara, taking Sofia&rsquo;s position, easily determines the cars would have made it unable for Sofia to have killed Bell. The bullet she found in the candle in the previous episode was the deadly bullet, and only a shot from Brass&rsquo; position would have caused such a shot.</p>

<strong>Sidle:</strong> You should not be in this building.<br />
<strong>Curtis:</strong> I was just talking to a friend. If I can&rsquo;t talk to a friend, who the hell am I supposed to talk to?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Any friend outside the department.<br />
<strong>Curtis:</strong> And how many friends outside of work do you have, Sara? Maybe I should go talk to my mother. Oh, no, sorry. I forgot. She&rsquo;s a cop, too.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I can recommend a departmental psychologist.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:fe69705294ebda92f2271fe1f9fdeb8d">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In a two-part case that highlights the possible ways for a community to be divided over a shooting, the CSIs find themselves in the unenviable position of having to be neutral parties between the police and the citizens they protect.</p>

<p>A routine traffic stop is interrupted by a high speed car chase, and Sofia Curtis and Jim Brass join the uniforms in the pursuit. The criminals are armed with automatic rifles and nine-millimeters, and are firing on the police vehicles from the start. The cops give chase for 20 blocks, one car taking 78 bullets, before the chase went to foot. The rookie cop was shot and killed, and the others take little mercy in hunting down the four criminals. Three are shot and eventually die, while one gets away, shooting a teenager to take his bike.</p>

<p>The CSIs arrive and split up the scenes. Catherine takes Brass and Sofia&rsquo;s guns, and stays with them for their interview and processing. Grissom and Warrick take the alleys. Nick and Sara take the cars. Greg takes the 20 blocks of chase scene.</p>

<p>Brass gives a fairly clear recount of what happened, staying calm and as coherent as he can. Sofia, on the other hand, is scattered, distracted, and obviously discombobulated. Her story is choppy and she can not clearly remember the entire situation.</p>

<p>Nick, who speaks fluent Spanish, is surprised when the locals claim the criminals were shot in the back. Sara, who speaks no Spanish, processes a house shot in the crossfire, and is accosted by a woman who wants to know why this happened near her children. The entire community seems more in arms about the cops treatment of the criminals and the shot (and eventually dead) teenager, than the facts that a police officer is also dead and the criminals had long rap sheets. The mother of one of the dead criminals shouts at Warrick, and her other son punches him, though charges are not pressed.</p>

<p>While all this rankles the police, the evidence does not lie, and matters will only get worse as it appears the dead cop was shot by friendly fire.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:fe69705294ebda92f2271fe1f9fdeb8d">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Seen primarily in the scene with the Spanish speaking mother, Sara is obviously shaken and uneasy when asked to explain how something like this could happen. She has no answer when the daughter translates, asking why someone shot their house. No translation is needed when the mother cries and hugs her children, wanting answers that have no questions. While Sara continues to work on the case, she obviously takes the question hard.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:60147c54580d6a52109ce11790100af5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two cases, both surrounded by secrets and lies. Or at least flies.</p>

<p>Catherine runs with the main case, of a woman, Christina Adalian, found dead in front of her baby, Joey, by her sister. While the scene appears to be a suicide, there&rsquo;s no blood spatter on Christina&rsquo;s hand. Another catch is that she&rsquo;s still a virgin and had the baby via Cesarean. Doc Robbins initially suspects frottage, but Sara digs up news that Christina was affiliated with Project Sunflower. Project Sunflower rescued leftover, or &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo;, embryos from in-vitro fertilization and match them up with willing parents, working on the belief that life begins at conception. Catherine disagrees with this, and the &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo; of the Project complains about her.</p>

<p>The gun is a lost cause, as if belonged to a lawyer who gave it to his paralegal, who became an EMT and lost it in a poker game to a guy with a mole between his eyes. The suicide note is analyzed and determined to be written under duress, confirming the evidence. Christina&rsquo;s will mandates that Joey be given to Dan and Kenli Johnson, who just happened to be the bio-parents of Joey. Dan is dead, and Kenli lives with her mother, Mrs. Walkey. GSR is found in their laundry, but it&rsquo;s on a size 12 shirt that belongs to Mrs. Walkey. Under questioning, and after her purse produces a picture of her husband with a mole between his eyes, she confesses. She killed Christina so that Kenli could have &lsquo;her&rsquo; child back.</p>

<p>Grissom, who is late with evaluations again, is pulled off the main case by Conrad Ecklie and the sheriff to help with a case gone to trial. It was the recent murder of the sheriff&rsquo;s god-daughter, and the defense has brought in expert etymologist, Mark Thayer, to prove she died when the suspected killer was out of town. Perhaps more to spike Thayer than help Ecklie, Grissom agrees to work on the case. Thayer presents documentation and a surprise video of an experiment proving his point. Grissom is stymied for a long time, but manages to determine Thayer doctored his pig in the experiment, forcing the flies to grow at a slower rate. Thayer&rsquo;s work is worthless and he is arrested.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:60147c54580d6a52109ce11790100af5">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Perhaps unexpectedly, Sara doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of emotional investment in this cast, offering no opinion on in vitro fertilization or conception. She seems content to go with the status quo, even when Catherine flies off the handle a bit, sitting quietly while Catherine vents at the head of Project Sunflower. Sara also displays her research skills, digging up both information on Project Sunflower and the Johnsons. At the initial scene, Sara and Catherine quickly realize that it is not a suicide, but rather a murder. She compliments the tech in QD (Questionable Documents), an older, bearded man. Sara informs Catherine of the biological parents and the victim&rsquo;s will, and together they visit the biological mother and her mother. Sara later finds blood on the biological grandmother&rsquo;s blouse.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Told with the whispery voice-over of a little girl, Nick, Sara, Warrick and Greg delve into the tale of what appears to be a quadruple homicide with no bodies. The McBride family (mother, father, son and daughter) live a quiet life and are known in their community. When the local doctor calls in a 911 call, spotting blood on the floor, the local police are stunned at the amount of blood in the house. The CSIs determine (with Catherine&rsquo;s help in the lab) that the parents and the son were shot and thus caused the blood in the house, however of the youngest, daughter Cassie, there is only a shoe full of cough syrup.</p>

<p>The CSIs investigate the house, which has been ripped apart but nothing appeared to be stolen. In the basement, they find an indoor marijuana farm. Much of the dried pot was stolen. They also learn that the son was another entrepreneur, selling essays to the other kids in his grade. One of the prints matches a kid in ROTC, who turns out to have the pot in his car&rsquo;s trunk. The son told his classmates about the pot in order to be thought of as cool, but when they came over, his parents were still there. The three teenage boys shot the son and the father, and then the mother when she came down stairs.</p>

<p>One of the boys was sent to drug the daughter, but she poured the cough syrup into her shoe and faked it, dropping &lsquo;cubes&rsquo; of [<a href="http://www.bubblicious.com/">http://www.bubblicious.com/</a> Bubblicious] gum as a Gum Drop trail. The boys then took the family out on a boat and dumped them in the middle of the nearby lake. One of the boys didn&rsquo;t want to dump Cassie, as she wasn&rsquo;t dead, and another boy slit her throat.</p>

<p>Cassie, however, was alive and managed to swim to shore, where she was found by Nick and thus able to speak (in whispers) and give us the voice-over for the episode.</p>

<h2 id="notes:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">=Notes=</h2>

<p>As originally written, the team was supposed to spend the night at a hotel since they were so far out of town; during the night Gil Grissom (unable to sleep because of Greg&rsquo;s snoring) goes to Sara&rsquo;s room, and she lets him in. Three scenes were originally written for this, and the first had been filmed when Billy Petersen&rsquo;s nephew died and he had to leave the set for a week. The script was re-written, and the scenes were deleted. Several weeks after the episode aired, Your Tax Dollars at Work (YTDAW) posted what they purported to be the original scenes. In a TV Guide interview in February of 2006, Jorja confirmed the setup (if not these specific scenes), saying that in the fifth episode (&lsquo;Gum Drops&rsquo;), Sara was supposed to sleep with Grissom.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara is the voice of reason and reality in this episode. When Nick blows up at a suspect, Sara gently calms him down and tells him she&rsquo;s worried about him. When Nick is too obsessive that the little girl is still alive, she reminds him of the odds.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Sara is called by Grissom (who&rsquo;s giving a lecture) to provide backup for Nick and brings Nick some coffee. She determines the crime must have happened somewhere between Friday night and Saturday morning, based on the gold stars Cassie should have received for her Saturday chores. After processing the house, Sara follows bloody footprints from the kitchen and discovers the marijuana farm in the basement. Sara also questions the doctor who called 911, pegging him correctly as being there to pick up his Mary Jane fix. It&rsquo;s Sara who finally gets the last teenager to admit to the crime, calmly asking him if he felt like man, killing a little girl.</p>

<p>Through the whole episode, Sara is solid and a good criminalist, on her top form. She tells Nick that in their job, it may not be best to hope that they find people alive. She also says that when it&rsquo;s your time to die, it&rsquo;s just your time. She remains cool and controlled throughout the case.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara is very accepting of the fact that children die, which possibly reflects on her mother having killed her father.</li>
<li>Sara appears non-committal when talking with Greg about gold stars and childhood, but then finds the marijuana in the basement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Grissom said you needed backup. I figured you needed coffee. But it looks like you took care of that.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I was really into gold stars when I was a kid.<br />
<strong>Sanders:</strong> As opposed to now?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(frowns and walks away)</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I hope you&rsquo;re right. But everything in our experience tells us they&rsquo;re dead, all four of them.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Doesn&rsquo;t mean we just give up.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> No one&rsquo;s giving up. It&rsquo;s just that &hellip; you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re going to rescue a person, not recover a body. And on this job &hellip; that&rsquo;s just not usually the case.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> I was rescued.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(smiles)</em> It was not your day to die. When it&rsquo;s your day, it&rsquo;s your day, you know?</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:f1c23826a772c7ea58a02033ebd690e5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A fairly straightforward case, in so far as they go. After dumping they body of Ty Bently in someone&rsquo;s yard, a dozen of unwashed cult members retreat to their compound and eleven of the twelve die by ritual suicide (spiked vodka) to ascend via the mother ship during the [<a href="http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html">http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html</a> Orionid meteor shower].</p>

<p>The cult members broke into the house by slashing the screen door, and proceeded to raid the fridge for junk food. They dumped Ty in the hard, who had numerous broken bones, and killed the dog with the same Ketamine they took later during the peak of the meteor shower. The cult was run by Joseph Diamond, who made a habit of luring impressionable young college students to his side, using sex with the woman (and possibly the men). The FBI had been keeping mild tabs on him for years, but generally he&rsquo;d drug the kids and steal their money (which they&rsquo;d written home for) and they&rsquo;d wake up broke with a hangover.</p>

<p>This time, the base was at an abandoned military observation bunker in the desert. Ty&rsquo;s ex, Emma, was a cult member, and he had recently argued with Diamond about Emma. Diamond was planning a one person, one way trip to Australia, presumably to take the act someplace new. One of the cult members, Abigail Spencer, catches on to Diamonds cut and run plan. Even though he invites her along, she sees it as a test and kills him.</p>

<p>Abigail then uses her knowledge from her former job to steal enough Ketamine to spike everyone&rsquo;s vodka and kill them. When Ty shows up to get Emma back (and call the cops on the mess), it&rsquo;s Abigail who shoves him the 80 feet down the bunker to his death, and convinces the cult to dump the body where he&rsquo;ll be found. Then she spikes the drinks and watches everyone die. Even though she wanted to join the others in rapture, she seems to realize that there is no Mother Ship, and runs away home without drinking.</p>

<p>When the cops come, however, Abigail gets scared and runs off, taking the leftover Ketamine in a last ditch attempt to kill herself. She&rsquo;s saved by Brass and LVPD, and confesses all to Grissom. After Abigail asks if Grissom believes in life &lsquo;out there,&rsquo; he tells her that if there is, they&rsquo;re smart enough to stay away from humans.</p>

<p>Yet another low-key Sara episode; she plays assist and little more. At the scene she dusts the refrigerator for prints. She goes through the prints collected with Mandy, and later has a brief chat with Brass about Jim Diamond and cults.</p>
