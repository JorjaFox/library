<h2 id="synopsis:0a763d240719aa832c6a7f84bccfb62f">Synopsis</h2>

<p>17 year-old Stacy was found wrapped in a shower curtain, in her school&rsquo;s flower bed, having last been seen alone at tennis practice. Marlon West, her classmate, is accused of her murder, based on the evidence of Stacy&rsquo;s hair in his shower and sink drains. However, on the stand it is his 12 year-old sister, Hannah, who confesses to the crime.</p>

<p>What is known is that there were fake &lsquo;out of order&rsquo; signs in the girls&rsquo; locker room, and the only non-labeled showerhead was packed with sodium, so that it exploded when Stacy used it. The explosion was big enough to cut Stacy, and she grabbed the shower curtain and ran off. In her panic, she fell down a flight of stairs and cracked her head open. The body was dragged to the flower bed, and Stacy&rsquo;s car was left outside her boyfriend house, Scott Baird.</p>

<p>In an earlier confessional, Marlon explained that he hated Stacy, though everyone else at the school adored her. Hannah also disliked Stacy, mostly because Stacy harassed Hannah, who threw off the grading curve. Stacy pranked Hannah a couple times, before enlisting Scott to encourage Hannah to come to the Spring Formal and give her a dress from Stacy. At the dance, wearing the dress, the words &lsquo;FLAT&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rainbow Party!&rsquo; were written in ink that only showed up under the black light of the dance. Pictures were taken and Hannah was embarrassed on [<a href="http://www.myspace.com">http://www.myspace.com</a> MySpace].</p>

<p>The blood found on Hannah&rsquo;s shirt was her own, but the soil matched the flower garden. Nick and Sara explore the house while Sofia talks to the parents. The parents obviously prefer Hannah, to the point they ignore her brother. The siblings share the bathroom where Stacy&rsquo;s hair was found, and while Marlon&rsquo;s room has no evidence, Hannah&rsquo;s has her award winning science fair project on elemental sodium.</p>

<p>While Hannah&rsquo;s prints are on the shower curtain, Scott&rsquo;s bloody prints are found on the car. The bloody prints were left over from Scott and Stacy&rsquo;s first sexual experience; he&rsquo;d wiped his hands under the seat.</p>

<p>Using Warrick&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s niece, he Nick and Sara test the crime and determine it&rsquo;s most likely the siblings committed it together, as Stacy would be too heavy for Hannah to drag. But Hannah claims to have used a cart to move the body, while Marlon sticks to his story. A pizza order to the West house at 9 P.M. (Stacy&rsquo;s time of death), exonerates one of the two, but the delivery boy can&rsquo;t remember which one answered the door.</p>

<p>The DA goes ahead with prosecuting Marlon, as Nick and Ecklie think he did it, and only Sara thinks it was Hannah. Marlon is found not guilty, and when he&rsquo;s checked out of jail, Hannah and Sara talk. Sara&rsquo;s worried about what will happen to Hannah, and Hannah says that no one cares about Marlon and how she can write a book about all this. Then she marvels at how people can see things that were never there, and confides to Sara: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Stacy, Marlon did.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:d2a882b41024b67f882cdbd2ef55755b">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The forensics reality show <em>Hard Crime</em> follows the CSIs as they work on the rape case of Christina Hollis. Raped in the very condo building she worked and lived in, Christina had been tied to her bed by duct tape and assaulted by Richard McQueen, a man posing as a fireman. The rapist&rsquo;s MO was to light smoke bombs in the building, knock on the door of a woman, knock her out with the lorazepam and to rape her over hours, multiple times. Additionally, Richard had a foot fetish.</p>

<p>At some point during the rape, Christina&rsquo;s quasi-boyfriend came by with flowers, but when he found the door was locked and heard Barry White playing, he assumed she&rsquo;d moved on and threw the flowers down in a huff.<br />
Christina was unable to remember a great number of details, but said she didn&rsquo;t paint her nails, which were currently painted ruby red.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s via the trace evidence of a scrap of cloth from Richard&rsquo;s fireman uniform that the CSIs can pin the disguise down. But the outfit isn&rsquo;t a perfect match to the materials used by the Las Vegas Fire Department, and quickly it&rsquo;s determined the fake-fireman is also the same man who set smoke bombs in another apartment building. As it turns out, that was a smoke test, as Richard was seeing how well his disguise worked. His first &lsquo;attack&rsquo; had been on a woman whom he&rsquo;d spied from his balcony, doing yoga on her own balcony. A month previously, he&rsquo;d met her at a bar, drugged her, took her home and given her a pedicure.</p>

<p>In Richard&rsquo;s apartment, all the evidence needed to pin him to the crimes was there, except Ricard. He was busy setting the smoke bombs for his next victim. The fourth and final victim he killed, because she wouldn&rsquo;t let him touch her feet. The real firemen caught Richard trying to flee, and proceeded to beat the shit out of him.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:d2a882b41024b67f882cdbd2ef55755b">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Sara has a strong dislike to rape. When asked if her following a lead on a cold case is as helpful as another rape victim, in terms of finding evidence, Sara says she&rsquo;d rather it not come to that.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A cold case dovetails with a hot one, when a John Doe is found in the chimney of a canoodling couple. The home owner, Martin Sidley, was a suspect in the missing persons case of sixteen year-old Caroline Fiztgibbons one year previously, but is stunned to learn the body in his chimney is his son. Catherine and Warrick, who worked on Caroline&rsquo;s case, join Sara and Nick on the Sidley case, with the intent to found evidence in their old case. The blood found (which is Caroline&rsquo;s), leads them to investigate the chimney further, and Caroline&rsquo;s body is found. Martin&rsquo;s son, Tad, is also found alive, having skipped school for a few weeks to party. Before Martin learns of this, he tries to pin the body on Tad, who confronts his father. The John Doe body was, in turn, placed in the chimney by Caroline&rsquo;s father, Don, who took it from the hospital where he works, knowing that the CSIs would investigate.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara again shows her type-A personality (wanting to do everything herself) when she practically searches the entire home by herself and with her love of power tools. While she strongly dislikes cases where women (or girls) are killed or abused, she remains calm and collected as she has all season. Sara discovers the reason why a body was stuffed in the chimney, and who did it, based on the prints she recovered from the roof. Catherine, rather than Sara (despite the fact that it is Sara&rsquo;s case), confronts Caroline&rsquo;s father and discovers that he took a &lsquo;John Doe&rsquo; corpse from the hospital morgue.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara understands why Catherine and Nick want to be on the case, and quickly agrees to let them in.<br /></li>
<li>Sara again shows her taste for horror novels when she references The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allan Poe.<br /></li>
<li>Sara has no problem with heights, scampering around on the roof to gather evidence.<br /></li>
<li>Sara lets Catherine handle parts of the investigation, even though she is the primary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Willows:</strong> Warrick and I were looking for a missing person about a year ago, and we tried to get a warrant to search this residence. The owner denied us access.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Now that it&rsquo;s a crime scene, it&rsquo;s fair game, if you&rsquo;re part of the investigation.<br />
<strong>Brown:</strong> You&rsquo;re picking up what we&rsquo;re putting down.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> She was still bleeding when she was brought here.<br />
<strong>Willows:</strong> Which means that her heart was probably still beating.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Cask of Amontillado.&rsquo; She was sealed into a wall and left to die.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:5e585dd512d0bd2e9a96f1624409a27c">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Ina complicated and disturbing episode, Lady Heather returns when her daughter, Zoe Kessler, is found dead in the desert wearing only a bra and panties. Zoe is emaciated, branded with the number 19, her hair has been shaved off and her right hand chewed off.</p>

<p>At the autopsy, they determine one of her eyes was severed at the optic nerve, and Zoe had necrotizing faciitis, which had been injected into her blood stream causing her to rot from the inside out. Zoe had also been injected with a variety of drugs normally given to mental patients, and her severed eye belonged to a convited sex offender named Jack Londers. When found, Captain Jack appears to be less than sane, though he agrees to come to the ER, where the doctor says he was lobotomized via his empty eye socket.</p>

<p>Only after seeing her daughter&rsquo;s picture on the news does Lady Heather herself come and ID the body. She request anonymity from Brass, who keeps the information from the press, but tells Grissom. They go check out Zoe&rsquo;s apartment and find that she&rsquo;s still interested in psychology. Zoe had also been to the Betz Clinic, who said she was there for chronic insomnia. Both Zoe and Capt. Jack were in the same test group, and both left the study part way through the night.</p>

<p>Lady Heather confirms the body is Zoe&rsquo;s, and even though she is torn up, Gil questions her about Zoe. About a year ago, Zoe had dropped out of Harvard and stopped talking to her mother, though Lady Heather didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate.</p>

<p>Results show that Zoe had <em>eaten</em> her own hand off, and the CSIs sweep the desert for her hand. Instead they found the house of Jacob Wolfwitz (from the Clinic), who happens to have a variety of genetically modified plants, including ones that smell like decomposing bodies. When they go to the door, however, it&rsquo;s Lady Heather who enters, having broken in. She explains to Grissom that she was hoping Wolfwitz would invite the cops in and they would find something probative. Instead, he dismisses the charges (never knowing it&rsquo;s Lady Heather or Zoe&rsquo;s mother), and Lady Heather whips out a manuscript she stole from his house, saying it was too expensive and must have been stolen.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the manuscript was stolen from the UNLV library, which is enough to get a warrent. Before they can act on it, Wolfwitz is found dead in his car, having been frozen solid at least two days before.</p>

<p>This sets everyone on edge, as the day before Catherine had interviewed Wolfwitz, and the evening before, Lady heather had slept with him. As she explains to Grissom, she needed a sample of his DNA for the CSIs. She also explains that Zoe had left Harvard because she&rsquo;d gotten pregnant with her therapist&rsquo;s child. As he was married and a doctor, Lady Heather had his license revoked, which was when Lady Heather and Zoe stopped speaking.</p>

<p>The dirt/mulch at Wolfwitz&rsquo;s house had the DNA of almost 20 different people, including Zoe, and the DNA from the condom (from Lady Heather) matched DNA on the UNLV book. His car, however, had the fingerprints of a Leon Sneller: Wolfwitz&rsquo;s twin. The boys had been adopted by a Jewish couple and Jacob had inherited the house. Leon, on the other hand, had rejected this and become a Nazi. The CSI&rsquo;s find a WWII era laboratory under the house, where Sneller performed his Mengele-esque experiments (including a siamese twins experiment, currently going on in one room, though neither twin lived after the CSIs rescued them). Zoe had been selected for her eyes: one was blue, the other brown.</p>

<p>The CSIs are unable to find Sneller until Grissom notices Lady heather&rsquo;s necklace under a couch. He drives out to where Zoe&rsquo;s body was found, and comes across Lady Heather and Sneller. She tied him to the front of his car and whipped him over and over again. Grissom stops her and Lady Heather breaks down sobbing.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:dd8bc1f91417debc4ec3a7c33fff9766">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In a twist to the normal CSI format, this episode was told from two perspectives: that of the CSIs and that of the killers.</p>

<p>Karl &lsquo;Red&rsquo; Cooper is a former bank robber and thief who served time when his former friend, Clayton Nash, finked on him and a bunch of their fellow criminals. Karl shoots and kills Clayton in retribution, after Nash contacts him as a part of the 12-step process to cure one&rsquo;s self of dependency. As Karl makes his escape, meticulous enough to not even leave a stray cigarette butt, he is broadsided by a drunk young woman named Ally Sullivan. Hoping to avoid the police, Karl tries to talk Ally out of calling them, but she does so anyway. Or at least she starts to, when Karl breaks her neck, leaving her for dead.</p>

<p>Back at home, Karl shaves his beard and tries to keep it secret from his wife, Janice, who knows of his bank robber past and the reason he served time. Karl follows the case of Ally via the television and feels some measure of guilt for the death of an innocent. He goes so far as to leave cash for Ally&rsquo;s father, by way of apology. When he feels the CSIs are getting close, Karl asks his lawyer (who is a lawyer for many former and current criminals) for supplies from which Karl can forge a new identity. Janice finds these and confronts Karl, who admits to killing Nash. While Janice understands the killing of Nash, she is horrified that Karl killed Ally and kicks him out. The next day, the CSIs come to Janice&rsquo;s home and threaten to take away their daughter. Upon finding this out, Karl turns himself in.</p>

<p>As for the CSIs, they appear to play catch-up for much of the case. They have little evidence, and it&rsquo;s not until they find matching fibers on Ally and Nash that they&rsquo;re able to link the cases and determine the killer. The car leads them to a used car lot where a blurry photocopy of Karl is their only lead. Checking the bus routes, they find the bus driver who recognizes Karl, and gives the stop he boarded the bus from. That stop turns out to be on an ATV route, where the CSIs find a burnt pile of clothes, including the gloves which left fibers at Ally and Nash&rsquo;s crime scene. The ATV tracks are particular enough to lead the CSIs to Janice. Also, the palm print Karl left on Ally&rsquo;s car links them to him, and the same last name between Janice and Karl is enough for a warrant, especially since Karl&rsquo;s record lists Janice, under her maiden name, as a visitor in prison.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:dd8bc1f91417debc4ec3a7c33fff9766">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>There is very little character development in this episode, as the majority of the story is told from Karl&rsquo;s perspective. Sara&rsquo;s best work comes when she tracks the bus routes that may have taken Karl to where he bought the car, which turns up a very attentive bus driver.</p>
