<h2 id="synopsis:910403f26969fa5afc8d20483b192183">Synopsis</h2>

<p>When a young camper, Carl Abrams, is stalked and slain in a remote area populated by Doomsday Preppers, the team investigates an underground bunker that holds several shocking surprises. Carl was dumped by an underpass by a man wearing night vision goggles, and died from having one of his hands cut off (the other was cut off anti-mortem). His leg had also been ripped apart by a bear trap. Carl was fond of camping around the mines near where the Doomsday Preppers lived.</p>

<p>The CSIs find a hidden bunker out by the mines with the help of Nick&rsquo;s dog, Sam, where traces of Carl&rsquo;s blood laces the stairs. A Prepper, Tommy, is found when they investigate, and while his room in the bunker is utilitarian, he has a second bedroom for a girl, or a women. The CSIs find a girl, Miranda, hiding in the air vents. Trace evidence on the dresses lead them to an unsolved murder of Rebecca Barnes, 11 years ago, in Carson City. Rebecca was Tommy&rsquo;s wife, and Miranda is their daughter.</p>

<p>While Tommy was out working odd jobs, Miranda was &lsquo;entertaining&rsquo; boys, one of whom was the dead Carl Abrams. The other was Luke Holland, who worked at the local supply store. Luke claims he didn&rsquo;t kil Carl, but he found the body after hooking up with Miranda, so he dumped the body. Luke also explained that Miranda didn&rsquo;t cheat on him with Carl, Carl and <em>his</em> boyfriend were using the bed for their of hookups. Carl&rsquo;s boyfriend was his best friend, Dylan Trigg.</p>

<p>It was Dylan&rsquo;s father who hunted down and killed Carl out of homophobia.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:68e2364e4681c93ccac1dfd04b3c8922">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Peter Coe, a professional poker player, lost big in the Palermo Poker Classic (PPC) before dying from having his neck cut open in the elevator of his hotel. The only problem? He was in the elevator alone. His friend (and virtual neice) Eva Rendell, the only woman left in the PPC, was at the hotel with Coe, but left before he got on the elevator. David Hodges solves the locked room mystery by determining the killer threw a playing card (the Ace of Spades) to slice Coe&rsquo;s throat as the doors closed. The card was part of a special set of cards made by the Palemro for the 1997 Classic that Coe won.</p>

<p>Trent Aldridge is found dead in a hotel, tied up spread eagle, and died by asphyxiation, choking on some food. While Aldridge checked in alone, he had clearly been up to some sexual shenanigans, and one the hotel staff was tipped by his partner with a poker chip. Seven raw chicken hearts (seven of hearts) were forced fed to Aldridge while tied up. In addition, Aldridge held a high-stakes poker game every week and played against Coe in 1997.</p>

<p>Chicken blood was also found on the playing card used to kill Coe. The conicidences send the CSIs to look at old cases, where they find Ed Ficelli, a pit boss of the Palermo, who OD&rsquo;d two months prior. The herion in his system had been poisioned, and the pattern of injections form a perfect match for a Four of Clubs. The prints on the poker chip that Aldridge&rsquo;s dominatrix gave as a tip match Eva Rendell. When they go to find Rendell, she&rsquo;s been beheaded in her hotel room by a mideval war hammer aka a poleaxe (King of Diamonds).</p>

<p>Bo Madison was the third player in 1997, when they were dealt the &lsquo;death&rsquo; hand: Ace of Spades, seven of hearts, four of clubs, King of Diamonds, and King of Spades. Madison has been dead for years, of suicide, so Greg watches the tape of the final match over and over until he determines that Aldrige and Coe were colluding with the dealer to beat Madison. The dealer was Eva Rendell&rsquo;s father, and also died years prior. Ficelli was the ringleader of the scam.</p>

<p>All of this ties back to magician, Dr. Jimmy, who loaned Coe $4000 to get into the PPC, is an expert at throwing cards, had a poleaxe, and skipped town shortly after being held on obstruction of justice. Jimmy had funded the scammers, and was in turn nearly killed by Bo Madison&rsquo;s daughter: His lovely assistant, Kathy Hill. Morgan Brody ends up shooting Kathy when attacked.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:b368fb849b8b977fcb257794ee5a41fd">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Sara is accused of murder of her aquantaince Taylor Wynard, with whom she had celebrated her birthday. Taylor&rsquo;s murder was part of an elaborate plot created by Ronald Basderic to discredit Sara and pave the way for her own murder. Basderic planned the murder for months and in the end is tripped up by the CSIs working together.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:b368fb849b8b977fcb257794ee5a41fd">Sara Sidle Review##</h2>

<p>Celebrating her birthday alone at a hotel, Sara is approached by Taylor Wynard, who buys her a mini-cake. After dinner she went with Taylor to his room and the next morning, while checking out, learned Taylor was dead &ndash; stabbed seven times. Right away, Sara talks to D.B. Russell about how she knows Taylor, however she states nothing happened. Yes, she went to his room and they had a little more wine, but she went back to her room alone shortly after Grissom texted her birthday wishes. The phone records claim that she called Taylor at 2am, and the room key records say she came back into her room around 3am. Sara has no memory of this, as she&rsquo;d taken a sleeping pill.</p>

<p>Of the CSIs, Greg wants to talk about it, Nick doesn&rsquo;t, Hodges&rsquo;s feels like she cheated on God, Doc Robbins wants to protect both Grissom and Sara, Morgan understands why Sara might cheat, and Finn wonders whose team everyone is on. Only Finn brings up the point that more people are paying attention to Sara&rsquo;s possible infidelity than the fact that she&rsquo;s been accused of murder. On Finn&rsquo;s advice, Sara goes home to relax, only to find the murder weapon being cleaned in her dishwasher.</p>

<p>Faced with photographic evidence, Sara explains that she met Taylor once before, two weeks ago, and they kissed outside a bar. But she did not cheat on her husband. Russell and Nick are concerned about Sara&rsquo;s behavior, and she admits that she and Grissom have divorced, implying it was something Grissom did with her best interests at heart. So yes, she&rsquo;s been having trouble lately.</p>

<p>The necklace found in the hotel room is Sara&rsquo;s, but she she insists she was not wearing it that night. In a parking garage by his work, Sara confronts Ronald Basderic, because the necklace was one that Edie gave her for helping file a case against Basderic. Basderic provokes Sara, remarking on her troubles. Sara slaps the phone out of Basderic&rsquo;s hand when he offers to call Grissom, and shoves him to the ground.</p>

<p>Back at her house, Sara is trying to get Basderic&rsquo;s phone records when the police come to bring her in. Basderic has come to the police, viciously beaten, claiming Sara did it. The parking garage camera shows that she shoved him, but Basderic moves out of the camera&rsquo;s frame shortly there after. Sara&rsquo;s processed, since there&rsquo;s enough evidence to indicate she did beat him. Thankfully Sara&rsquo;s clothes are free of any trace, supporting her claims. The CSIs consider Basderic for the crime, and how easy it would have been for him to find the information. When Basderic serves Sara with a restraining order, Sara is put on leave, and the team doggedly tries to exonerate her and find evidence against Basderic.</p>

<p>While Sara was in lock up, her mother gets a bottle of alcohol and ends up in the ER with blood poisoning. When Sara goes to visit her mother, Laura says she prayed Sara would never turn out like her, but there Sara stabbed Taylor, just like Laura stabbed Sara&rsquo;s father. There&rsquo;s no way Laura should have known about that, and when Sara presses her, Laura says that Sara&rsquo;s friend &lsquo;Ronald&rsquo; told her. Sara rushes home to get her personal weapon out of her gun locker.</p>

<p>Checking the key logs, Nick verifies thats someone used a keycard override on Sara&rsquo;s room shortly before midnight. Hodges determines that Sara&rsquo;s sleeping pills had been tampered with, double strength. Morgan finds that the shower drain grates between Sara and Taylor&rsquo;s rooms have been swapped. Greg finds sight of Basderic on the hotel&rsquo;s surveillance. At this point they determine that Basderic is setting Sara up, like he did another man years ago, so he can shoot her and get away with it.</p>

<p>While Sara&rsquo;s stalking Basderic&rsquo;s house, the CSI&rsquo;s pull over Basderic and take his gun while talking to him. When Basderic isn&rsquo;t paying attention, the detective swaps the bullets for blanks. Sara breaks into Basderic&rsquo;s house and threatens him, saying she&rsquo;s going to stop him. Sara fires the gun at him, only to find that Basderic removed the firing pin from her gun.</p>

<p>Basderic tells Sara he was, indeed, behind everything. He&rsquo;d hacked her email, followed her, paid Taylor to come to see her at dinner, even paid for the cake, and planned for months, just to have her at his mercy. He fires his gun, not harming Sara in the least, and she pulls out a voice recorder, showing she had, in fact, set <em>him</em> up with the help of the CSIs.</p>

<p>With the case closed, Nick and Greg come to Sara if she wants to talk. She tells them she had hoped Grissom would come for her birthday anyway, and thanks them for not giving up on her.</p>

<strong>Stokes:</strong> <em>We</em> just thought that it might be a good idea to talk.<br />

<strong>Sidle:</strong> Have a seat. I didn&rsquo;t mean to shut you guys out. I didn&rsquo;t tell you about Grissom and me because I didn&rsquo;t believe it myself. You know we made that dinner reservation together, before we split up. As I sat there, alone, in the restaurant&hellip; I honestly expected him to show up.<br />

<h2 id="synopsis:23f54055caddbef523320bb767e6ae3f">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Cuban singing sensation Silvana is about to make her U.S. debut at Estefan&rsquo;s Vegas nightclub, much to the ire of the Cuban exile community, led by Willie, who considers her a tool of the Cuban government. But when Silvana&rsquo;s sister Marta is tortured, poisoned and killed, it seems that Silvana has also become the target of a vengeful killer. Marta was killed elsewhere and her body brought to Silvana&rsquo;s dressing room, staged in one of her dresses at her vanity.</p>

<p>While Silvana is hugely popular, a large number of protesters are outside her venue: Cuban exiles who wanted her to return to Cuba. Her manager, Antonio Ficha was also her handler, meant to ensure Marta and Silvana don&rsquo;t expatriate and stay in the USA. The leader of the Cuban Exiles, Eddie Santos, was the owner of the shop where Marta was tortured and killed. While his DNA is not a match for that found on the scene, it does match a relative. Eddie&rsquo;s nephew is Estefan Meha, owner of the club where Silvana is performing, and Eddie was tortured by Silvana&rsquo;s father back in Cuba before he escaped to America.</p>

<p>While being beaten, Marta was also poisoned by being force fed casava leaves, a plant that causes cyanotic effects when eaten. When Silvana comes down with the same symptoms (though she was poisoned via pills), and it&rsquo;s determined that Marta had been in contant with a restricted number in Washington DC, it&rsquo;s apparent Marta was considering leaving Cuba for the United States forever and had called seeking asylum. This is, in part, due to Estefan, who was in love with Marta. They met up at Eddie&rsquo;s shop to make love, and Silvana found out and killed her sister.</p>

<p>Marta wanted to come to the US, and to marry Stefan. But Silvana was also in love with Estefan, and killed her sister over that, framed Antonio, and coerced him into killing Estefan by tricking him into thinking Antonio killed Marta.</p>
