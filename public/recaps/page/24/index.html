<h2 id="synopsis:7ca30925ef7798b43e7ea685bac5d448">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Sean Becker, a racist, is found dead by a high school, practicing Cabaret as their musical (with Catherine&rsquo;s daughter, Lindsey as the star Sally Bowles, dead in the storm drain. Sean was not, however drowned, having been stabbed by a Phillip&rsquo;s head screwdriver beforehand. In searching Sean&rsquo;s home, turns out to be a rather well read intellectual.</p>

<p>Nick and Greg find the murder weapon, while Sara and Ray go over the history of injuries found on Sean. Meanwhile, the team talks to everyone Sean had fought with recently, including Laurent Senyabou. Laurent is also the only person sad Sean is dead. Laurent claimed that Sean protected him from some skinheads, Sean&rsquo;s old friends. Over the last few months, Sean had talked to Laurent about the genocide in Rwanda, which Laurent had survived, and became compassionate and understanding. Sean had begun to learn that hatred only begets more hatred. Unfortunately, his girlfriend, also a racist, found out and told his friends. They got into a fight with Sean, and she thinks that they killed Sean, though she didn&rsquo;t see the murder.</p>

<p>The killer was actually Laurent, or rather Matthew Babajide, who was not a victim of the genocide but a perpetrator and a chief architect of some of the more horrific actions. Matthew was attempting to reconcile himself with his past, create a new life, however the War Crimes Tribunal still has a warrant out for his arrest. The CSIs are able to pin Sean&rsquo;s murder on Matthew, who killed him after Sean discovered his true identity.</p>

<p>Sara and Brass go to deliver notification of Sean&rsquo;s death to his Alzheimer afflicted grandmother (his mother suffered a mental breakdown when her husband left her for another man).</p>

<p>Sara catches Lindsey reviewing the case files and talks to her. Lindsey is sympathetic to Sean&rsquo;s life, and feels bad for not being nicer to him. A few days prior to his death, he&rsquo;d asked her about AFIS. While Lindsey thinks Sean was hitting on her, Sara wonders why he was interested in fingerprints, and goes back to Sean&rsquo;s house to look more closely. She finds a raised fingerprint on an index card, shoved in a book, which leads the CSIs to Matthew Babjide.</p>

<p><strong>Brass:</strong> You&rsquo;d rather deliver notification to next of kin [&hellip;]? That doesn&rsquo;t sound like the down and dirty Sara I used to know.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I like to see where haters come from.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:38f6307c6608abe110d068bdc7a19135">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Fourteen year-old Will Sutter is found dead in the field, his body dumped, with snacks, a pocket knife, and a compass. The case takes an off turn when the blood under Will&rsquo;s nails was that of Simon Rose, a man Sara put in jail two and a half years ago.</p>

<p>Simon was accused and convicted him of murdering his wife. He choked her to death on the kitchen floor, while he claimed to be asleep upstairs. Simon&rsquo;s nose was broken, and there were scratches on his face, belying his claims. His lawyer uses the blood as reason to argue for an appeal, claiming that the blood proves someone else was guilty of the crime.</p>

<p>Sara goes to the evidence locker to see if the blood was taken from there, while Ray goes to visit Simon in jail to see if he has any cuts where blood was drawn. George, the head custodian of central evidence, knows non-public details about the case, and his car has proof that Will was transported inside it.</p>

<p>George claims that Will was snooping around in evidence, including the Simon/Samantha Rose case&rsquo;s box, when he fell and accidentally died. Afraid that Will compromised evidence, he transported the body. The CSIs find blood at the crime scene, backing up George&rsquo;s story, but also finding that Will was looking for the Rose case file.</p>

<p>When his self-professed &lsquo;former&rsquo; best friend, Mason, is determined to be an accomplice in Will&rsquo;s break-in of central evidence, Brass investigates only to find Mason with his head bashed in on the floor of his own bedroom. In addition, the card of Simon Rose&rsquo;s lawyer is found in Mason&rsquo;s room. The lawyer claims Mason tried to extort her for information, as he knew that Will broke in on a dare.</p>

<p>Mason had asked Will to break in because he and Steve, Will&rsquo;s other former best friend, had been partying and drinking underage in an abandoned house. They&rsquo;d accidentally started a fire, and when the CSIs had collected the evidence, they asked Will, smart Will, to help them. But Mason wrote down the wrong evidence box and Will died. When Mason didn&rsquo;t seem to care about Will&rsquo;s death, Steve bashed him in the head with a bat.</p>

<p>And Simon Rose remained in jail.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:38f6307c6608abe110d068bdc7a19135">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Perceptively noticing that he looks ill, Sara admits to Steve, Will&rsquo;s former best friend, that she drank when she was younger, to try and be cool. When Steve vomits, Sara correctly deduces he&rsquo;d been drinking tequila.</p>

<p>Sara commiserates with the man working at central evidence that this sort of case, where the rich man goes free, is one of the cases that caused her to quit CSI and go to Costa Rica. They review the evidence together to ensure it wasn&rsquo;t tampered with. While leaving, Sara notices George&rsquo;s car matches the description of the one that dumped Will and investigates it, only to find evidence that Will was in the trunk.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:db01ebf240704f115cda7d93046fe867">Synopsis</h2>

<p>When a band member of Rascal Flatts is electrocuted by his own guitar during a concert, the CSI team investigates if it was a case of foul play. The bassist, Jay DeMarcus, suffers from a mild case of amnesia after the electrocution. The guitar is swapped out before the CSIs can get to it and has to be rescued from a fan before they can determine the guitar tech set Jay up in order to play one more time on stage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sara and Ray look into the death of a former CIA officer found in a Lake Mead, his head cut, no ID, and 24-hours dead. The vic was dressed after being struck in the head. The body turns out to be former deputy directory of operations, Vance Colton, who was dying of cancer and writing a tell-all book. Not wanting to die a sick man, he arranged for a friend still in the CIA to spin up his death, dying a hero.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:db01ebf240704f115cda7d93046fe867">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara and Ray end up working directly with the CIA, and clashing with them to protocol. They&rsquo;re one step behind the CIA for most of the case, due to the CIA not giving them information. Still, they&rsquo;re able to determine the primary and secondary scenes, and run into the German Consulate, who are following them because they&rsquo;re implicated in Colton&rsquo;s book.</p>

<li>Grissom and Sara take canoe trips, and went on one looking for bugs on their honeymoon.</li>

<h2 id="synopsis:00ceb5799f6b7e37f84cc48866dff4ce">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The case of two high school students, one dead and one missing, lead the CSIs into the underbelly of streetcar racing and a tangled web of deadly competition.</p>

<p>Trevor Beck, a high school senior, dropped dead in the school hallway for no obvious cause. In the autopsy, they determine it was caused by cerebral menigina, however there was no injury sufficient to cause the damage. His girlfriend, Cindy Warner, has also gone missing. Cindy used to date Miyamoto Takahachi, whom Trevor punched in a fight over her.</p>

<p>Trevor died of an undiagnosed malformation of his brain stem which, when he was injured, caused his brain to swell. In addition, he was taking anti-depressants and an MAO inhibitor (given to him by his best friend), which worsened the condition. Cindy is found dead outside of town, thanks to the GPS on Trevor&rsquo;s car. While her body appears to be dumped, there&rsquo;s no evidence to how she ended up in the desert. In fact, she was hit by a car driving so fast, she was thrown the length of a football field.</p>

<p>Unknown to his friends, Trevor had started to race his car at the police sanctioned &lsquo;Street Rumble&rsquo; and had been scraped by a yellow car. The car is tracked down to a street racing group called the Demons, one of whom is Mitch. However, Trevor had a classic car and only raced against other classics, and happened to beat Cindy&rsquo;s best friend and locker mate, Renata Clarke, in a race. In that race, Trevor suffered whiplash, which caused his brain stem to crack and his brain to swell.</p>

<p>Renata got Cindy, her BFF, to &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; Trevor&rsquo;s car so Renata could race it against her own car, driven by Gus, her uncle and guardian, in an illegal street race to prove that Trevor&rsquo;s car was better than Renata&rsquo;s. During the race, Gus accidentally hit, and killed, Cindy. Afterword, Renata and Gus take the car to the Demons, who part out the damaged parts and replace and repair.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:00ceb5799f6b7e37f84cc48866dff4ce">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara goes to the high school to find Trevor&rsquo;s girlfriend, Cindy, and works with Nick in processing Trevor&rsquo;s car. Later, working with Hodges, Sara determines how Cindy died, recognizing the injuries on her legs from previous experiences .</p>

<p>When investigating the race, Sara flirts with the boys, talking about cars, in order to get a better look at the car. While she appeared ignorant of the &lsquo;sacrilegious&rsquo; nature of putting an electric engine in a 1968 classic, she is knowledgeable or at least able to recall the information determined from the evidence.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:00ceb5799f6b7e37f84cc48866dff4ce">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara is an environmentalist.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:00ceb5799f6b7e37f84cc48866dff4ce">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Putting an electric motor in this [car] is sacrilegious.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Not a polar bears.</p>
