<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You get &ndash; you come into the theater and you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Ah, I know that one song, it&rsquo;ll be great&rsquo; Never mind what an amazing colorful story she had, in what an amazing colorful times. Then you get in there and you actually know the songs, and you&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Oh wow!&rsquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s amazing to me that this story hasn&rsquo;t been told before, 500 times already.</p>

<p><strong>Leslie Brockett:</strong> I know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s one of those things that you just go &ldquo;Huh, why hasn&rsquo;t this happened?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s way overdue.</p>

<p><strong>Katherine Kendall:</strong> It&rsquo;s going to be a night of some rocking music.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And some laughs! Definitely some laughs.</p>

		<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> All right, we&rsquo;re gonna talk all about this play and everything Jorja related, but you, you made sort of a conscious decision - you know, you&rsquo;ve been on this very successful show, and then, you left. What, what, what &ndash; was that a real soul search, or was it &ldquo;gee, it&rsquo;s time&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh, yeah. Yes, yeah, very very much. It was harder to leave than it was to stay, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Oh I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And I will be, there will be a moment, I will return. &ldquo;(gasp from somebody off camera)&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t tell you when or why or how&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Oh like in a box, or what&rsquo;s the first thing&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Uh, I can&rsquo;t tell you, very secretive&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> But in terms of that, and I think there are many people who weigh in on the discussion, working as a successful actress such as yourself, there&rsquo;s a, a manager or an agent somewhere, maybe an accountant, did they say &ldquo;Are you outta your mind&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. A lot. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I have been so incredibly blessed, I did eleven and a half straight years on prime time TV at night.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Okay, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s amazing, it&rsquo;s an amazing run, I feel so lucky and, and grateful for that, and I felt like, &ldquo;okay, here I am, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m coming into, you know, very soon sort of the second half of my life&rdquo;, and I just wanted to take a breath for a minute and, and think for a minute, &ldquo;what would that look like?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> What does that look like?&ldquo;. It might really look like nighttime TV drama-</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> -but I needed to just get off the ride for a second to evaluate it and regroup, and the violence, I needed a break-</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I was gonna, I was gonna do a little projection, you almost answered the question for me. The show&rsquo;s very good, but it&rsquo;s very grim,</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> incredibly dark.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, very dark.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you think if you were kinda working on a happy sit-com, you might&rsquo;ve had a different thought?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s possible&hellip; I really never had the, I&rsquo;ve never been able to work on a, I&rsquo;d love to check out a sit-com, see what that&rsquo;s like. I did one comedy many many years ago, and it was single-handedly probably the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had doing a movie. And it&rsquo;s just because the goal of the day really is to laugh, and hopefully everyone will laugh, and yes, I&rsquo;d love to exper-, I&rsquo;d love to, I&rsquo;d love to let you know. &ldquo;(comment of &ldquo;Uh-huh&rdquo; from off camera, Jorja laughs)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Well something that&rsquo;s obviously very gratifying to you, it&rsquo;s a theater company called HoneyPot Productions, and, uh, tell us about this whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a life and music of Dusty Springfield, going up at the Renberg Theater in Los Angeles for &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; three weeks, and uh, we do about thirteen Dusty songs in the musical. She had an amazing, interesting, colorful life and a very amazing, interesting times. Uh, her career kinda started in the early Sixties, ran almost to the late Nineties, she felt, you know she was up, she was down, she dealt with substance abuse, she was one of the first women in the business that was producing her own music, she had a, a, just a really dynamic life. So if you &ldquo;like&rdquo; her music you will love the show, and you&rsquo;ll get to learn the-</p>

<p><strong>off camera voice:</strong> But you&rsquo;re not Dusty Springfield.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, I so wish I was- &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>other anchor:</strong> What do you play?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> -I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve no talent for singing or dancing, in any capacity. So I am simply producing-</p>

<p><strong>other anchor:</strong> Oh, so you&rsquo;re not even-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> -I&rsquo;m one of three producers. So, uh, Johnny Prado is our head producer with Leslie Brockett, and uh-</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> We&rsquo;re gonna look at a clip in a second of the woman who does play Dusty-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yes. Kirsten Holly Smith, she&rsquo;s breathtaking. And really,</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So you and the other producers are involved in that casting, did you think not with envy, but &ldquo;gosh I wish I could do this&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh I so wish. One of my dreams in my life actually is to be a rock star. And Kirsten also wrote this script, uh, with a little additional material by Patricia Cotters. So,</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Here is a little bit of the play that Jorja is, uh, behind the scenes on and wants to encourage you to see, so watch this.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(clip from &ldquo;Stay Forever&rdquo;)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Gosh, she really, she obviously, does that take you back to your bedroom playing your brother&rsquo;s 45s?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yes. My brother&rsquo;s twelve years older than me, and uh, when he went off to college he left me his 45 collection. So I was &ldquo;very&rdquo; acquainted with the music of the Sixties at a young age. Uh, it wasn&rsquo;t-</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Did you have a Close And, did you have a Close And Play?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>off camera voice:</strong> Close And Play, I remember those.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I had many dance parties-</p>

<p><strong>off camera voice:</strong> Nice.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> -for a few years.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer 2:</strong> Was it more important for you in casting, uh, for Dusty&rsquo;s role that the person &ldquo;sound&rdquo; or &ldquo;look&rdquo; like her? I mean&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I think the sound is, is, is really quite an quintessential. This show is &ldquo;really&rdquo; about the music of Dusty, so that, that would&rsquo;ve, that was the single-handed, most important thing, putting it together. Kirsten Holly Smith not only plays Dusty in this piece, also wrote this piece, and it came out of a grant from USC. They did one night at USC, and, ah, we&rsquo;ve taken it from there. There was interest, there were a couple of theaters interested, we sort of worked the script a little bit, and here it is, it&rsquo;s a first run, so&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> You can see &ldquo;Stay Forever&rdquo; at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center&rsquo;s Renberg Theater, it&rsquo;s February 7th through the 24th. Ticket information is on your screen at 323-860-3200. KTLA has got more information as well. It&rsquo;s really nice to see you Jorja, come back.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you so much, guys.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It was a pleasure&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &hellip; weekend in Los Angeles&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer 2:</strong> Enjoy marinating too. I&rsquo;m excited what you&rsquo;re not substituting.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you. Oh, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t even talk about that.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer 2:</strong> Oooo&hellip; you gotta come back then.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, a couple later, yeah&hellip;</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Ten and a half years of deaths -</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yes</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> - violence -</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What is it with you -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I just had it of dead bodies -</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah, seriously!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I mean I&rsquo;ve just had it.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Seriously, what is it with you and these roles, like these really hard, like, and the dialog is like really hard too! And like &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And like &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and like, seriously, like, all these-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughing</em> It was the dialog! It was so hard! I couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> No, I know, I-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, I&rsquo;ve been very lucky. I&rsquo;ve gotten to play some very, very smart women. Which is a stretch for me.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Which is fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And, yeah, and I mean - Sara Sidle studied nuclear physics and fusion at Harvard and Berkley. And that was really excited, I was really proud of that.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> I was really intimidated having you on the show because of all that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Really? It&rsquo;s not me, though!</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Do you remember any of your lines from that? Cause it&rsquo;s always really hot. The stuff that you say is totally-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>Embarrassed</em> Thanks, aw, thank you. Phenoethylene terephtalete.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah, what the hell is that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughing</em> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> I&rsquo;m going to make myself wait till later -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Mass Spectrometer.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> - wait till later, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughing</em></p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Do you have any idea what that means?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Phenoethylene terephtalete? Not anymore. No. That&rsquo;s the problem. Like the short term memory. You learn it for the day and then you have no idea what you said the day before.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Do they tell you what it is you&rsquo;re saying, or&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> At the time, yes.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> So &ldquo;This is what it means.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, and that one was so hard I had to practice it for about four days. Cause you want it to, try and sort of roll off the tongue, so I&rsquo;ll never forget the word, and I have &ldquo;no&rdquo; idea what it means.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Okay. What was the storyline? Why did you leave? You were IL, you were in love with somebody, or you-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I did. I had a smokin&rsquo; hot boyfriend on the show, and we got engaged. And then I dumped him, I gave him a Dear John letter and I just took off in the middle of the night. And essentially, for the character, it was she had this stressful experience, the serial killer took her out to the desert and almost killed her and &hellip; She&rsquo;d had it, really, with the death.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Does that stuff ever feel real to you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s, you know, we try to make it as fun as we can. The unfortunate thing is that many of our stories are based on real &hellip; stories. So, when you get the script and it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s life, yeah, I think it affects you a little more. You know it&rsquo;s make believe that you&rsquo;re shooting it, but it really happened to someone.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> But - And you were on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the same kind of lingo. As far as-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Depressing. Totally depressing.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughing</em> At least sometimes they lived! Every once in a while on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; you&rsquo;d cure them. Which is good for them. But it was really high stakes, high stress.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> I can&rsquo;t remember how long you were on that for.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Three years. Yeah, I had a little run and then it was &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; in there, and then &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; for the last seven and a half years.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> That&rsquo;s right, &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo;. Another easy one, another easy show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. Another violent. <em>laughing</em> My role anyway. The show wasn&rsquo;t violent, my role was. I was a part of this plot, this racist plot to assassinate the president. And so my role was really violent. <em>laughing</em> My part of the show.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> So, and &ldquo;Memento&rdquo;, you were in &ldquo;Memento&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Violent, pretty gross.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Pretty gross shit.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Who&rsquo;s your fucking agent!? I mean, it&rsquo;s like &ldquo;I think this would be really good for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughing</em> Yeah. Well it&rsquo;s been amazing. I feel so blessed. I think I&rsquo;m one of the luckiest people in the world, really. And it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;ll never do violent stuff again, I&rsquo;m sure I will. Violence is great drama. Just for a minute, I just kind of needed to get off. You know? Just take a little break.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Right. Now-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m taking sailing lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Are you really?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, I&rsquo;m learning how to play the drums. Finally.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Years later. That whole rumor that I play drums is not true.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> The rumor that you play guitar is true, though.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> That one is true. Yeah, badly. <em>laughing</em> Yeah, a couple people [in the audience] have seen me.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Why do you say badly?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Bad guitar? I just really, I never really, I don&rsquo;t really have any musical talent. I&rsquo;m persistent and <em>laughing</em> I practice a lot, but I have no ear. At all.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Where are you playing the drums? Where can we see you rock it out?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Nowhere yet, thank god.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Any bands? Any garage bands?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No. I&rsquo;m just taking classes. So right now it&rsquo;s percussion classes. I bring my African drum and we go and we kind of do stuff. And then, hopefully, that class is about eight weeks, and then I&rsquo;ll move to the kit class. Hopefully.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> The what- Oh the kit!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> The drum kit.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> The kit. That&rsquo;s what it is, right.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Kind of musician talk.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> The lingo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna move to the drum kit.&rdquo; Yeah, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Wish me luck!</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What was it - you said? Sailing! Where at? Where are you sailing at?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s sailing classes you can take down at Marina Del Rey.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Are they teaching you in like those little Sunfish boats? With the one little sail and the scoop out -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah and you have to wear those plastic floatie things. On your arms. It&rsquo;s in the bathtub, actually, at the YWCA.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What are those things called? Wings. They&rsquo;re called wings. No, seriously, are they in that kind of little boat, or-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s a decent sized boat, you know what I mean. Like they&rsquo;ll take - I don&rsquo;t know how many people they have - the class. Our class has like 12 people in it.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Okay, so you&rsquo;re all on the boat.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, most of the time. I mean there&rsquo;s parts there where you have to learn - you learn the lingo. You know and like nautical. Words like that.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Right. Tacking. Tack. Tacking. Which means fucking duck. It means f-ing duck. That&rsquo;s really all you need to know on that one, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <em>laughter</em></p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I was born in New York City and then they moved to Florida. My mom had the dream, she wanted to live in the small beach town. She had that dream her whole life. And three years after I was born, they made it happen. So they moved down -</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Oh cool.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. They moved down there. And I moved back when I was 16.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> You when to high school there.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I finished high school in New York.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I actually did finish.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What was your first acting &#8212; You did finish?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It was a close one.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> You did?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. I have even a real diploma. It&rsquo;s not even a GED. I almost had a GED and then I-</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And you didn&rsquo;t get it off the Internet cause they didn&rsquo;t have the Internet back then.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, no. Nothing. There was nothing, no gadgets at all.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> The interwebs. What was your first acting thing? What is high school or something after?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> High school was first. Actually, I wanted to be an actor since I was very little, and my mom found &ldquo;one&rdquo; acting class, you know, in like an hour of where we grew up. I was five years old, and I was really excited. And the deal with the acting class is that in order to take it, you also have to take the modeling classes. And I didn&rsquo;t really - I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in modeling at all, but I really wanted to act. So I took the classes for a while, and, um, I got a job. The first job I got, we were going to do a play at the mall, &ldquo;Chicken Little.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Uh huh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> In Florida. And I practiced really hard and I got the role of the Rooster.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Oh, awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And, uh, <em>laughing</em> I was awesome until I did my first thing as the Rooster, and everybody laughed really, really, really, really, really hard.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Do you remember the line? Do you remember any lines?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It was like a <em>crows like a rooster</em>. Something like that.</p>

<p><em>Audience cracks up &hellip; Ian cracks up .. Jorja cracks up</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And I quit! I was so mortified, really. Everyone was laughing at me. <em>looks at the audience, mock accusing them of the same.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> That&rsquo;s awful.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t act again until high school. There was finally a drama department in high school. And oddly enough, I moved to new York for my modeling career. But it was only because that was my ticket out of Florida. Like that was the way I could go to New York. So once again I had to model to try to be an actor.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Did you do some of that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> A little bit. Yeah. It was great, actually, at that age. Cause you know, 17, 18. I got to travel a lot, I lived in Europe. I was a &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; model. I mean, I never really enjoyed it, I wasn&rsquo;t good at it. But I made some money, and I was able to take acting classes for a couple years.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And do what you wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Drink cappuccino.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Yeah. Be very romantic.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> We were all 19. Yeah, smoking, the cappuccino, talking about Mamet and stuff. It was really cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Where were you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Uh, mostly Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Cool.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Brooding, it was a brooding time of my life.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What are your -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Not much has changed.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> You had your journal open.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh yeah. I still have my journal. I&rsquo;ve got it with me.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What&rsquo;s your passion right now? What do you-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You know what I <strong>fuckin</strong> really hate?</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> What? Bring it, sister! Wha&rsquo;d&rsquo;ya got?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I fuckin&rsquo; hate the people in the &ldquo;left&rdquo; lane of the freeway so fucking much that won&rsquo;t move over! Like when you&rsquo;re trying to pass them. I really think there should be a law and people should get tickets for that shit. It&rsquo;s just - It&rsquo;s rude, it&rsquo;s selfish. I mean- okay, maybe you mean something a little different.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> No, no that was perfect. Are you thinking about a 501&copy;(3)? Sort of a non-profit route?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, you know I would love to - yeah for that? Yeah. I&rsquo;m accepting donations!</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Now, actually, are you a vegetarian?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I am a vegetarian.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> You are?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. The environment&rsquo;s a really big-big thing for me.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> So, if you were going to, like, swing me over the fence to be a vegetarian, what would you tell me? Like what - three things -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I, uh, try not to proselytize.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> But&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Like three things that I would need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Okay. Well, cows &hellip; produce more methane from farting than any substance on the planet. So a big part of global warming is actually cows in fields &ndash; it&rsquo;s true! &ndash; sending up a lot of really noxious fumes.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And because of our demand for meat.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, they&rsquo;re everywhere. And it&rsquo;s also a huge reason for deforestation and a big reason for - you know like the spinach thing last year. Where a lot of people ate organic spinach and they got really sick, was because cow was getting into crops. You know that stuff goes down rivers and streams and it pollutes waterways. I&rsquo;ve always been kinda of like &#8212; we all do what we can do.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> I think one of the things that&rsquo;s hardest is the cooking part of it. Like I&rsquo;m so ingrained: I have meat, I have starch. How do you change that thinking? It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s not easy. I&rsquo;m French-Irish and all we ate was meat and potatoes. So it&rsquo;s really all we ate. When I became a vegetarian - I&rsquo;ve been a vegetarian for like 20 years, and the first two years all I did was eat cheese and eggs cause I really didn&rsquo;t know what else to eat. I was extremely confused. For like every meal.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> So, like, eggs are cool with you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You know, I don&rsquo;t eat that much, but I eat them. It&rsquo;s a very personal choice. But, yeah, the cooking thing is hard. I think that in, like, LA or New York &#8212; If I was in the Arctic Tundra and it was like me an a seal? And I was really hungry? Maybe, you know, I would make the choice to survive. But if I&rsquo;m living in LA? I mean, there&rsquo;s right next door there&rsquo;s Damiano&rsquo;s. You can get, like, a slice of soy cheese pizza with veggie &ldquo;pepperoni&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s easy. It&rsquo;s pretty easy.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> That&rsquo;s good pizza over there. You have something going on that you&rsquo;re -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I do.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> That you&rsquo;re excited about. Tell me about it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m really excited about it. Kirsten Holly Smith, who&rsquo;s a really old friend of mine, is here tonight and we&rsquo;re doing a play. I&rsquo;m producing, she is staring in it. Uh. A show about Dusty Springfield. It&rsquo;s a music. <em>crowd cheers</em> Yeah! And the story is way overdue to be told. She had an amazing, incredible life. Pretty much a 30 year career span, over in Europe and the United States. And we&rsquo;re doing this show, it opens February 7th, in Los Angeles, at the Gay and Lesbian Center, the Tomlin and Wagner Theater. Kirsten&rsquo;s myspace page or my website will have it posted in a week or two.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Your website is?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> <a href="http://www.jorjafox.org">Jorjafox.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Okay, .org.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Mmm hmm. And that&rsquo;s filled with political ramblings of all kinds. It&rsquo;s my myspace page.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And give us a couple sentences background about her life. About Dusty&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, Dusty&rsquo;s pretty &ndash; She really came on the music scene in the early &lsquo;60s. She was one of the very first women that produced her own music and her own sound. She was one of the very first performers to stand up against Apartheid. In honor of Martin Luther King Day, today, thank you very much for that. She was also one of the first artists to come out as bisexual and lesbian. Like way before David Bowie and all those guys. So she&rsquo;s a very brave lady. She dealt with substance abuse and breast cancer. We&rsquo;re going to tell some of that in the story, it&rsquo;s almost &ndash; it&rsquo;s kind of too rich a life to tell it all in 90 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> We&rsquo;ll also perform, I think, 10? Dusty Springfield songs. Or 11. And the band&rsquo;s amazing, the story&rsquo;s amazing, Kirsten&rsquo;s amazing. You&rsquo;ll get to see her in a second.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Alright. Fantastic. There is one question that I&rsquo;m sure is on everybody&rsquo;s mind here. That everybody&rsquo;s probably wanted to ask you, and I don&rsquo;t know if anybody&rsquo;s ever asked you this before.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> And I know it&rsquo;s kinda one of those things that maybe, you know, that in this sort of atmosphere I could probably ask it, and it would be okay. I guess I just want to ask, what was it like to film that After School Special back in 93?</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Was it 93? I&rsquo;m sorry, what year was that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Gaaaaahd. You know- I can&rsquo;t believe you asked me that. No comment. I don&rsquo;t talk about that.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Fair enough, fair enough.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Cool. Alright, cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Harvie:</strong> Fair enough. Jorja Fox, everybody! Thank you so much.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you, so honored to be here with all of you. &ldquo;(to Whoopi)&rdquo; And happy birthday to you, a day late.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> You&rsquo;ve been here a few times&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> This is my fourth round. Second time in the hot seat &ldquo;(pats the table)&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m just very excited. And awake.</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> Yeah. Well awake isn&rsquo;t always important. Me, halfway. But let me ask you - you, you&rsquo;re about to make a big change in your life, are you not?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, change has come, a little bit. Ah, there&rsquo;s a show on tomorrow night, &ldquo;CSI:&rdquo; &ldquo;(clips playing in the background from &ldquo;[[Goodbye and Good Luck]]&ldquo;)&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a very very very big show for my character, Sara Sidle, and um, it&rsquo;s one of those things, you know, everybody has times in their lives, and I&rsquo;m speaking about the character right now, where you wake up in the morning, and you think your day&rsquo;s going to be like any other, and by the time the sun has set your life has been changed forever. So, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say about it.</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> Excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Things change &ldquo;(snapping her fingers)&rdquo; just like that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Life&hellip; does that to people.</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> And, how about you, Jorja, you looking for other things also to occupy time or you going to take a break?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;so&rdquo; fortunate, I&rsquo;ve been eleven and a half years consistently on primetime TV, I was pretty young when I started, and, um, I&rsquo;m just sort of at a place in my life where I want to breathe for a second, take a look around, uh, there&rsquo;s a lot of thing I&rsquo;d &ldquo;love&rdquo; to do, like-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Like what?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Um, well I&rsquo;d love to take a surfing trip through the southern hemisphere-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Oh, me too, I&rsquo;ve been dying to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo; It&rsquo;s summer. One of the upsides, I can date the cast now, &ldquo;finally&rdquo;, after seven and a half years. I can date the cast.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Is there anyone in particular you want to date?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s a couple I might start with, yeah, that are still hanging on to being single, I can think of one or two.</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> Does the audience know that you are, uh, leaving?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Um, maybe, maybe yes, maybe no, I mean yes, certainly&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Oh, you don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, something&rsquo;s gonna happen to Sara, what I can say is stay tuned, I believe she&rsquo;ll be back. But as of tomorrow night-</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> We don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, and I can&rsquo;t say anything really more than that.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> There&rsquo;s always so secretive on these shows.</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> You&rsquo;ve gotta do some stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> It&rsquo;s gotta be tough.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be fun. And interesting. It&rsquo;s harder, it&rsquo;s probably the hardest decision I&rsquo;ve ever made in my life because I never got bored, I love it there so much, I love everyone so much. You guys know when you work with a group every day, and you love those people-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And you could do that forever.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(commenting on Whoopi&rsquo;s outfit to Sherri)&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(laughs when Sherri does her Tina Turner imitation)&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(gets up and models her outfit for the audience - slinky black slacks, scoop neck black top, gray bolero jacket, black high heel sandals)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fashion Specialist:</strong> And here her jacket is only $29.99&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;ll do a turn. &ldquo;(turns around for the camera)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fashion Specialist:</strong> The pants are $59.99, for a total - she&rsquo;s wearing her own tank top - for a total, a total of $89.98.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(sitting back down; to Sherri)&rdquo; I wanted to look smart, cause I&rsquo;m not, but I wanted to look smart.</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> It looks cute.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(reading from her notes)&rdquo; Well the producers said there were three Protestant ministers there, and so maybe next time they do it, it would be great perhaps if there was a wider community, interdenominational, I think people would feel&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> Well I think that sometimes when you say, when you say I&rsquo;m praying, or when you talk about God, people get really upset.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Sensitive.</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> They get very sensitive about that. And I go, I go what&rsquo;ve you got to lose</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(smiling)&rdquo; And absolutely invite Native American elders, uh, next time, cause if anyone can successfully bring rain&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(commenting to Sherri)&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> We are back. We are back with our special co-host, today, she&rsquo;s the star of the hit show &ldquo;CSI:&ldquo;, Miss Jorja Fox. Welcome back.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Hey the prompter-</p>

<p><strong>Whoopi:</strong> They spelled it that way so I would pronounce it correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> yeah, it&rsquo;s spelled like the state of Georgia, &ldquo;(turning to Jorja)&rdquo; but you spell your name J-o-r-j-a.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> My mother did that. &ldquo;(laughing)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Wait, it&rsquo;s not a foreign spelling, it&rsquo;s just-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s, uh, it&rsquo;s-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> -a hippy, dippy spelling maybe?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, &ldquo;(grimacing, talking out of the side of her mouth)&rdquo; Yeah, I&rsquo;m a child of the 70&rsquo;s, or somethin&rsquo; close to there, uh. &ldquo;(smiling)&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Jorja-An, my mom was French, it&rsquo;s Jorja-An, and she thought &lsquo;J&rsquo;s would be interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> The J&rsquo;s are French.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, not necessarily.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Sherri:</strong> &ldquo;(talking about her appearance on &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune&rdquo;)&rdquo; Big check?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Did you write her a check? Did you write her a check?</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You&rsquo;re so brave. I did &ldquo;Hollywood Squares&rdquo; when you were hosting once, and it was also a charity event, it was for women in Afghanistan, and I was the &ldquo;(sitting up straight for a moment)&rdquo; &ldquo;square&rdquo; square, just praying that nobody would call on me, and I was like &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t call on me, please don&rsquo;t call on me&rdquo;, like there&rsquo;s so much pressure, especially when you&rsquo;re playing for charity, and you&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Interestingly enough, I think more, more Republicans will come out to vote against Hillary Clinton than they would Barack Obama or John Edwards.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Say that again?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> More Republicans will come out to vote against Hillary Clinton-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Oh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> -than they would against Obama or, or Edwards.</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> You think so?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> That&rsquo;s a news poll that I read, so, whereas if, if it&rsquo;s, if it&rsquo;s Obama or it&rsquo;s Edwards, they might be less&hellip; likely to jump out to the polls and say &ldquo;we have to vote &ldquo;against&rdquo; someone&rdquo;. Instead of voting, going out to vote for someone you&rsquo;re going out to vote against someone that you&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m glad that there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that I like, you know, I&rsquo;m sort, for me, I tend towards the left, and it&rsquo;s nice to see a group of several people that I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;oh, wow, who&rsquo;s it going to be it&rsquo;s such a hard choice&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m thinking in years past-</p>

<p><strong>Joy:</strong> Well they could still lose it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well one of them, right, one, or someone, will represent the Democrats.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Molly Shannon:</strong> &ldquo;(to Jorja)&rdquo; I love your new house.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> What did it take you, actually, to get into comedy?</p>

<p><strong>Molly Shannon:</strong> Oh, who..</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, how did, how did you find this life for yourself?</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(about Molly Shannon&rsquo;s new film)&rdquo; It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Molly Shannon:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s three different parts and they&rsquo;re all you. I mean, usually if you&rsquo;re playing three different parts in the film they&rsquo;re sort of three different people. And you&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, &ldquo;All My Children&rdquo; is here, &ldquo;Dancing with the Stars&rdquo; is in L.A., you&rsquo;ve been traveling back and forth from coast to coast, how, what was that like for you?</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(end of episode)&rdquo; Thank you.</p>
