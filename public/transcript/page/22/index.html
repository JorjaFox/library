		<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong>: Although it now may seem hard to believe, it was just two years ago the hit drama &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; barely made it on to the primetime schedule. The show has since become a hit with an unusual look at forensic investigators who solve crimes with science.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> The stars of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; are William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, Jorja Fox and Paul Guilfoyle. Good morning, everybody.</p>

<p>(EVERYONE): Good morning, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Show of hands. Who thought this show was gonna be a hit? &ldquo;(Everyone but Jorja raises their hands.)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> It was the script. See, it was the material&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> A hit. We knew it was gonna be good, but I think that no one expected it.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna be, you know, 25, 28 million people watching.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We didn&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> &ldquo;(jokingly)&rdquo; And I think everything I do is gonna be a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s the one next to you &ldquo;(pointing to Jorja)&rdquo; that seems to be the good luck charm. I mean, regular on &ldquo;[[ER]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;[[The West Wing|West Wing]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; Sign you up in the making!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Thank you. I didn&rsquo;t think the show was gonna be a hit. I think I was the only one that didn&rsquo;t. I had so much hope and faith and so much belief in &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; but I really wasn&rsquo;t quite sure we were gonna stay on the air, but I was really happy&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Why not?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Well, I think it was a hard pitch at first for a lot of people. We were last to go at everything. Last to get picked up, like you said. And talking about death and science.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Hair fibers are a major element of the thing, and fingerprints. It was a question of how well we were gonna be able to translate that to the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, usually audiences are turned off by things that are about death, that are bloody, that are macabre. What are they responding to in this case?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Well, I think that the professionalism of the people. I think all drama is about people and interaction and I think they&rsquo;re really responding to all of us as a group. However we all cemented together is, I think, what people are responding to.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re all just working people, I mean, on the show and we operate in our jobs the way people go to work and operate in their jobs. We&rsquo;re very technical, very proficient, and I think it&rsquo;s interesting to watch the process. I think people enjoy watching the process of us put the science to the crime and solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But most of the time, people view people who are engaged with science as nerds. How are nerds turned into heroes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds. We just have better clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> I think also that the plot, that crime is the antagonist of our show. So, you watch this group of dedicated professionals try to come up against or conflict with the crime itself. So I think that&rsquo;s what takes it away from the nerd thing is because of what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> How much do you really know, any of you, about forensics?</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We&rsquo;re getting to know more and more everyday. I mean, I knew very little when we began.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I don&rsquo;t leave my fingerprints on anything.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> No, I do. I think about that all the time, whether or not I need to put on a pair of gloves or not.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Come on!</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> I do!</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Every couple of months, we get better and better, at least, at being able to use the tools and being able to know what the tools are used for. I&rsquo;m certain now if we came across a crime scene, we would at least know how to secure it.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Well, for instance, sometimes they&rsquo;ll do shots that don&rsquo;t include us, like tape-lifting prints from something and it would have been an added shot. And I saw this on an episode recently and my character was supposed to be doing it and I actually did it on the master. And then I saw the close-up and it was not my print. And it was so sloppy. And I felt like I wanna be doing my own inserts now because it was done&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna ask you, look, the show is fiction, but is the science [exact]? I mean, is that the one thing you never tamper with?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> The science is all real. The stuff we use is real, and the way we use it is all real.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I think some of the crimes are all real. They&rsquo;re based on real crimes. There&rsquo;s a lot of crime out there, unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> The process is sped up.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> You&rsquo;re never hurting for story lines.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Yeah, it is unfortunate. Talk to me about the collaborative effort of this. I mean, as I look at all of you, you&rsquo;ve all had individual achievements and have been primary players in something else. Is it something where you have to check your ego at the door of a show like this?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> I think that&rsquo;s the wise thing to do with all work. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a long day. It&rsquo;s a long day if you don&rsquo;t. And the great thing about this show, and I think in this case we&rsquo;re different than a lot of &ldquo;hit&rdquo; television shows in that our writers, our producers, our actors, our crew, even all the way to the network, we are very collaborative. It&rsquo;s not just one person&rsquo;s decision, as many hit television shows are. They come from one voice. We have a whole lot of people that work very hard all day long with each other to try and make this stuff work.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Do you get involved in the plot lines, the story lines? You&rsquo;re making a face there, Jorja. Yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. We do.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &#8216;Cause we&rsquo;re dedicated. So, I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes even for better for worse, I don&rsquo;t know if everybody always wants to hear from us, but they always act like they do. And they let us talk and they listen to us a lot, which is very kind of them.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And acting is kind of the detailed work, almost like the way forensics is and in the course of the process of creating a television show, the acting is kind of the final touchstone of reality, and so I think that&rsquo;s where we all have our own unique experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> In the final moments we&rsquo;ve got left the show is now going to have a spin-off. How uncomfortable are all of you with that?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> As actors, I think anytime something else comes along to try and compare to your stuff, you get a little queasy about it.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But you have the same people and they now have their attention split.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Here&rsquo;s the deal. It&rsquo;s a very successful show and the network is &hellip; and what &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; has done to television is a remarkable thing and I think that CBS is interested in some of that.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> That&rsquo;s a very provocative question, by the way, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> We&rsquo;ll have to pursue it during the commercial. Guys, thanks very much and congratulations.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Congratulations to you. Great job all these years.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Thanks, Bill. The season finale of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; airs tomorrow night at 9, of course, here on CBS. We&rsquo;re back in a moment, right after this.</p>

		<p>The character Sara is ten gazillion times more courageous than I am. You know, we do things sometimes and me, Jorja, in between takes is like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this, I can&rsquo;t do this. Let&rsquo;s make sure, we need to be careful, where&rsquo;s the medic?&rdquo; And then the camera&rsquo;s start rolling and Sara Sidle kinda just goes in and does it. We did a helicopter scene. This year George Eads and I had a scene where we were rappelling out of a helicopter.</p>

<p>The intent is not to be gratuitous. At the same time, because the show is so visual and we can go places with that, there&rsquo;s moments where we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology! So you want to have that opportunity if you can. Yeah, it shows up very heavily in the scripts. Sometimes the scripts are- I can&rsquo;t read the scripts late at night. I have to read them earlier in the day or I don&rsquo;t sleep very well.</p>

<p>I have so much respect and admiration for the folks who do this. You can show up every day and try and figure out what has happened. There&rsquo;s sort of that quote we have on the show, that we meet people on the worst day of their lives, and take things from there and try to provide, at the very least, some closure.</p>

<p>Sara Sidle is not squeamish. She&rsquo;s very cerebral, and she lives for what she does. And I think she can become emotional affected by what she&rsquo;s experiencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of her ability to be there, to be present.</p>

<h2 id="intro:9cec4b965fd749470bb087dedbfd13c2">Intro</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I never knew that I wasn&rsquo;t equal to everyone else out there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was your favorite female crime fighter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There were the pioneers out there, you know, like Angie Dickinson [&hellip;] I grew up on Charlie&rsquo;s Angels. Those women seemed, they were just incredible. They were so fierce. You know? &lsquo;Cause they were doing karate chops and solving crimes and had the guns and yet they were still young and smart.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** CSI&rsquo;s crime scene investigator is Jorja Fox.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think we feel like we get to play such smart, kinda cool women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want to be when you grew up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I wanted to be an actor or a rock star. A marine biologist or president. [&hellip;] You know, my specialty, here at CSI &hellip; <em>laughter</em> Is right here <em>taps her head</em> I always solve the cases. <em>camera nods</em> Most of the time. Don&rsquo;t tell any of the other actors that, though, they&rsquo;d get upset. <em>camera shakes it&rsquo;s head</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were your role models growing up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Reverend Dr. King, John Lennon. Later Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The world of crime is dark and disturbing, but the women of Primetime Crime roll with the punches.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s an opportunity in a way to sort of go somewhere &hellip; and see a really primal, vital, important part to life, you know? There&rsquo;s three sides to life: there&rsquo;s birth, there&rsquo;s life and there&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you a tomboy or a girly-girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> My mom wanted a little girl so bad and she got a tomboy! <em>laughter</em> And she loves me!</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The women of Prime Time Crime recreate situations that police officers, detectives, forensic scientists and coroners face every day. For these leading ladies, taking on this challenge is an honor.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I have so much respect for the people who do this job, you know and admiration. It&rsquo;s not a job I could do. [&hellip;] Hi, E! I&rsquo;m Jorja Fox! I play Sara Sidle on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. I&rsquo;m a forensic scientist, I&rsquo;m also a criminalist. This is Ali, my dog, like Muhammad Ali, the boxer. She&rsquo;s visiting with me here today, she comes with me a lot because I&rsquo;m here a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Narrator</strong> CSI is set in Las Vegas, but the show is actually shot in Santa Clarita, CA.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> This is the set of CSI, these are our offices. I&rsquo;m going to take you on a little tour. This is one of my favorite microscopes, it&rsquo;s a comparative microscope. So you can take, lets say, two different bullets, and put one here and one there and got back and forth and see if they look anything alike. You can put almost anything, anything that we might be wanting to compare goes through this microscope and it&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> If you look over to your right you&rsquo;ll see sort of a collection of all different sorts of weapons and guns. I&rsquo;ve always been a pacifist, I mean it in my very heart, I&rsquo;m a pacifist. But you know, I&rsquo;ve got to admit that when I shot them a couple times, for different things I&rsquo;ve done, that part&rsquo;s kinda fun.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The CSI set is a long way from the small town in Florida where Jorja grew up.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I was really goofy, I was wild. I was very fun most of the time. I had a really great, idyllic, childhood. Like always in water, always swimming. I was pretty fearless.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Fearless enough to want to be an actor.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I always wanted to be an actress. Like always, always, always wanted to be a- I either wanted to be an actress or a rock star. And I couldn&rsquo;t tell you why! And you think sometimes, you&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m living my whole life on a decision that I made when I was five.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Even five year olds can make the right call.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s a great job, because you can be so many different people. I mean yeah, you always want to do the best job you can. I think we all are pretty much &hellip; If you&rsquo;re trying to tell a story that&rsquo;s close to real life, then you want to pay it as much respect as you can. I&rsquo;ve never met anybody in this business who&rsquo;s really not trying to tell a story with soul.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Jorja Fox has been a woman of Primetime before, with recurring roles on ER and The West Wing. But it&rsquo;s CSI that really put her on the map.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Honestly, what struck me was these six lines of this character description which this person had created. Here&rsquo;s this person, Sara Sidle, forensic scientist, criminalist, can drink people under the table kinda thing. Very smart, poor people skills, action oriented, adventure oriented. And I was like, &lsquo;Wow, I really have to go explore this!&rsquo; Sara in a way, it&rsquo;s weird, she&rsquo;s kind of hero of mine. She&rsquo;s much gutsier than I am. She&rsquo;s very spontaneous. And she&rsquo;s a daredevil in that sense. If it&rsquo;s dark and dangerous, and luminous she&rsquo;s in it. Much more so than I am. I&rsquo;m a little bit neurotic.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** But the actress is also motivated by the gadgets she gets to play with and the mysteries she gets to solve.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think that this show&rsquo;s kind of unique, just by the nature of what it&rsquo;s about. There&rsquo;s so much more technology, technologies that are breaking every day. Like we have tools on the show this year that people weren&rsquo;t using last year. So that&rsquo;s an edge that&rsquo;s very exciting. That you&rsquo;re moving with something that&rsquo;s breaking through while you&rsquo;re trying to tell a story. [&hellip;] This is the Layout Room. Whenever we get a case together and we&rsquo;ve got a lot of different things from different places we&rsquo;ll put it all on this table and sit down and we&rsquo;ll hash it out. Like maybe we&rsquo;ve got a shoestring from one thing, and we&rsquo;ve got a hair from something else, and we&rsquo;ve got a parking ticket from someplace. And in this room we&rsquo;ll sit down and fight out and really, often, find out exactly what happened [&hellip;] The story lines are challenging and insane every week and that&rsquo;s really exciting. Like you never know what&rsquo;s going to happen next. I certainly think that TV is smarter right now than it&rsquo;s been in a really long time, and I think that audiences are currently really enjoying it. Like people appreciate it if something&rsquo;s realistic, I think they appreciate something if it&rsquo;s truthful. [&hellip;] This may be my very favorite room. Because &hellip; it&rsquo;s got a couch in it.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** But Jorja doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to lounge around very often.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I love everybody more than I ever thought I could love people that I work with. But I&rsquo;m never home, so I try to bring home with me. Keep my guitar in my trailer. My dog is my guru. My dog is obviously my best friend, that&rsquo;s the oldest statement in the world, but everyone knows it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the one woman you admire most?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Maya Angelo</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** The women of Primetime Crime play it smart. They act fearless with their emotions in check. But just because these leading ladies act tough, doesn&rsquo;t mean they always are.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I&rsquo;m the wimp of the cast. I have the weakest stomach, I gross out the quickest. I don&rsquo;t want to see it the most. I&rsquo;m a stickler for safety, I&rsquo;m always worried about if everything&rsquo;s safe. I&rsquo;m the nebbishy one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t doing this job, what would you be doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I&rsquo;d probably be playing a guitar in the background somewhere.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Being a woman of Primetime Crime takes dedication and commitment. The hours are long, the locations are sometimes far from home, and personal time can suffer.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I think it&rsquo;s hard on television. Everyone says that and it&rsquo;s a big stereotype, but I think it is. It&rsquo;s hard to juggle your work, your family, your friends and your self.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Crime can be a grind, so each of these actors has found her own recipe for rest and rejuvenation.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I have a little theater company with some friends. We put plays on. I like to go hiking, I surf a little bit.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Success and hard work go together for these women, but sometimes the costs seem outweigh the rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I don&rsquo;t think there really is too many sacrifices or challenges. I go at this mostly with a very deep sense of gratitude. Here I am, lucky enough to get to do what I love to do. You can think to yourself &lsquo;Well this is very cool in storytelling.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s one of the oldest forms of communication. If anything, I have just a tiny bit of guilt, that wow, this is what I do for a living.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** It&rsquo;s the era of strong women.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I feel like I&rsquo;m an empowered woman, and I feel a little naive in that sense, because I feel I&rsquo;ve always been given the chance to be an empowered woman.</p>

<h2 id="credits:9cec4b965fd749470bb087dedbfd13c2">Credits</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <em>playing guitar</em></p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Narrator** Is that an original [song]?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s an original. Just made it up, not quite sure what I&rsquo;m playing. <em>Jorja plays guitar as we fade to black</em></p>

		<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Thank you. I am here with the cast of CSI. Your show has taken off, like, y&rsquo;know. A train, just steaming right out of the station.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We&rsquo;re dazed. We&rsquo;re dazed and confused and so happy and yeah! It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> I see Marg has gotten a lot of attention for the show for the last, what? For last season.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> But now the whole show is being acknowledged tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Robert David Hall</strong> It&rsquo;s the great chemistry. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to go to work.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now did anyone, did any of you get offers, or did everyone have to sort of go through the whole process?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> They actually made us all audition, I think. Anyone-</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Hall</strong> Except for Billy Petersen.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(everyone laughs)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How many times- How many times did you have to come back?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Twice.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Two times, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Szmanda</strong> Two.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Oh they already hired me like months before, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Now, and you shoot on location in Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> How much fun is Vegas?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s hard to concentrate sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Vegas is it&rsquo;s own character, you know. Vegas, Vegas- We don&rsquo;t have to do anything, it does itself, so&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Do you still, like, walk to the casinos and go &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m gonna go out tonight,&rsquo; or is it more is it just like &lsquo;eh it&rsquo;s Vegas&rsquo;? Cause I spent a lot of time there, growing up, when my mom was working there, and you kind of get numb to the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There are certain ones of us here who have to have their money held for them.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> Ahhh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I won&rsquo;t mention any names &ldquo;(points to Gary, George and herself)&rdquo; but they&rsquo;re here.</p>

<p><strong>Melissa Rivers</strong> We&rsquo;ll save that for the ending interview, how about that? Cause I have a feeling you guys are all going to be nominated for that. Thank you so much for stopping and best of luck tonight.</p>
