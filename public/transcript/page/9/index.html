		<p><strong>Host:</strong> &hellip; It&rsquo;s 9:15.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And what a treat for us. <em>CSI</em> returns tonight at 9 on CBS. Ladies and gentlemen, Jorja Fox right now on the Kevin and Bean show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Aw, thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> More importantly, Sara Sidle returns tonight. That&rsquo;s what I care about.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Yes! Yes yes yes.!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> What your character has been put through in the course of this series, Jorja-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> My goodness gracious! Right?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &ndash; is been ridiculous!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, I would have to agree. But happily so. It&rsquo;s been so much fun to do all that stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Great stuff to play, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There was one episode alone where I felt like the writers were trying to kill me. Just about every way that you could try to kill somebody on this show.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> They crushed you with a car, I remember that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah! There was under the car, there was getting thrown out of the car, there was a fistfight, there was walking through the desert. You know, pretty much, yeah! The whole episode.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And then they sent you off to Costa Rica. And now you&rsquo;re back.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve last seen Sara. That was a big moment, cause there Billy and I were, under the sort of like, the Costa Rican canopy, and it was-</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> By Billy you mean William Petersen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> William Petersen, of course, yes. He plays Grissom.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna start calling him Billy! I like that!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Only it may be a little overly familiar! But I thought &ldquo;Well, this might be it!&rdquo; You know, &ldquo;This might be the end of Sara&rsquo;s chapter, it might be the last time I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; So I was very surprised to get a call this summer.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And that time, you came back cause Warrick got shot. Right? That was the circumstance?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, well that was, you know, that&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s sort of a touchy subject. I wish that Warrick was alive out there, somewhere. But. Warrick was murdered, before the last scene where Billy goes to Costa Rica. So the last time we see &ndash;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Oh! that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s right!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ndash; William Petersen and Sara Sidle, is in a Costa Rican rainforest.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> My timeline was off.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, you know, Jorja, time travel is very big on TV these days. Isn&rsquo;t it possible that you guys could go back to just before he was shot and stop it? Save him? Put him back on the show?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I- You know, I&rsquo;ve been pitching a prequel for years! It gets harder and harder. We&rsquo;re starting our tenth season, so to try and do a prequel means people have to de-age us by a decade. And that&rsquo;s pretty challenging at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Piece of cake! Piece of cake.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Maybe the animated prequel.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Before we get caught up and talk about what happens tonight, and the return of season 10, thereâs no way anyone, in the beginning, thought that <em>CSI</em> would turn into one of the biggest hits in the history of television. When you guys started, I mean, this was something new on network television. Your show came out, doing stuff different. But nobody expected the juggernaut that it became, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I thought a show about death, on a Friday night, was gonna be a gigantic clunker. Really, terrible, horrible, clunker. But the story was so intriguing to me, I sort of fell under a trance from the moment I read the script. I was like &ldquo;Alright, well I have to do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> I think, people take it for granted now, but at the time we had never seen anything like it before on television.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you. Well, there was Quincy! That goes back a ways&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] This is far stretch from Quincy. Forensics have come a long way since Quincy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] Yes. And they&rsquo;re still coming a long way which, I think, is an advantage that we have. New technology is coming out every month, and we can use it.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I remember in the early episodes, where they would follow the path of a bullet into the body, and show you all the damage it does. And your head would explode! You&rsquo;d never seen anything like it, even in a movie, let alone on television! And then, you thought initially, week to week, solving cases, we&rsquo;ve seen this done on tons of procedural cop shows, and that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the standard. The old standards.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But the character development in <em>CSI</em> is what I feel really set it apart. How we got so attached to your characters and followed them through all these different permutations over the years.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Like an old suit, from the 70s, slowly but surely-</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But you find twenty bucks pockets! Now you must have, in the course of research or just interaction with experts that come by to advice on the show, you must have dealt with a lot of real life C.S.I. people over the years. Who are the people that go into this field, that love this kind of work? What drives them?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It&rsquo;s a very diverse group. I think that there&rsquo;s a couple things they have to have. They have to have almost like an OCD type of focus, and a patience and a persistence. And I think they&rsquo;ve got to be very, very, committed to crime fighting. And we still, every day, we have a tech advisor on our set, every day, still trying to help us look as realistic as possible. There&rsquo;s real crime scene investigators in the writers room almost every day. We have personal relationships with a lot of those guys, both from &ndash; The cool thing about our show because we shoot in LA but we take place in Vegas is that we can &ndash; if it&rsquo;s real in either one of those cities, we can put it on air. So we have people from both cities giving us stories and advice.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Oh I see! Are there are lot of women that go into the field? And are there <em>more</em> women going into the field now because of you? And because of Catherine&rsquo;s character?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well that&rsquo;s very kind of you. They tell us that that&rsquo;s true. That yes, there are a lot of women going into the field. One of our first advisors, Liz Devine, was in Los Angeles, a very early sort of woman in the field, and she was blonde and well endowed in all the right places. Sort of faced that textbook stuff you hear about when women enter fields that they&rsquo;re not traditionally in. More and more so, I think women, if I&rsquo;m going to get stereotypical, I think women are really, really geared towards the field because of that patience and that persistence.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But they&rsquo;re not really smart enough though, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> They&rsquo;re very good at detail oriented work, where you&rsquo;re on hour eleven and you&rsquo;re still holding your focus.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Really it&rsquo;s just puzzle solving more than anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, great big puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Let me ask you one more question before the break. Jorja Fox is here and will tell you all about the premiere of season ten of <em>CSI</em>. But here&rsquo;s the question I have to ask, is it true that because of the success of <em>CSI</em>, it is harder now to impress a jury? Or harder to &ndash; in many cases a jury will think that they real life is like the television show, and it makes it harder for prosecutors sometimes, when they don&rsquo;t have the slam dunk, scientific evidence that you often come up with on your show. Have you heard that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> What we hear, actually, is the opposite. We hear it&rsquo;s a lot harder for cops. For instance, I get my car broken into, and a police officer arrives, and I want the crime solved in, like, 48-hours, and I want him to pull out his DNA kit, fingerprinting and stuff. I think, originally, in courtrooms, it made it a little easier, because these guys were pitching this kind of science, for a while, but juries weren&rsquo;t quite grasping it. Now they have a really good understanding of what all of it means.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Ballistics, GSR, latent GSR! GSR all over his hands!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Laypeople &ndash; We amateurs know so much more about police work and science of the C.S.I. than we ever would have thought possible, because you found a way to make it entertaining.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> <em>CSI</em> returns tonight at 9. A quick break! More with Jorja Fox, if she doesn&rsquo;t give us all the Swine Flu, when we return, right after this on the Kevin and Bean Show!</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Jorja Fox is in our studio. The return of <em>CSI</em>, season 10, tonight at 9 on CBS. Now because you&rsquo;re the big dog on the television schedule, every year the other networks try to figure out &ldquo;How are we going to take <em>CSI</em> down.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are we going to do this year to take <em>CSI</em> down?&rdquo; You have been up against every show in the history of television.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> True! Yeah, and we&rsquo;re up against a pretty good one right now, who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t mention on the air. But you guys have been promoting it several times this morning.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa (co-host):</strong> Oops!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> We&rsquo;re not responsible for commercials.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, little medical drama.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Don&rsquo;t hold it against us! &ndash; OH! That one! Oh that show SUCKS! It&rsquo;s all <em>CSI</em>! It&rsquo;s way <em>CSI</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Aww! Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> You&rsquo;re either gay or Lisa if you&rsquo;re gonna watch that show.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> It&rsquo;s just a chick show, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> So Sara returns tonight. Do we find out the state of her relationship with Grissom, while they&rsquo;ve been away? Do we look into that at all this evening?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> In about 12 short hours, in Los Angeles, you will. I think you&rsquo;ll get at least a sort of an establishing amount of information that I was very pleased with.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> We&rsquo;ve all been curious what&rsquo;s been going on after that kiss in Costa Rica.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I think we were in Costa Rica for a nice long time. That&rsquo;s all I can say at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Got a lot accomplished, did you?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How used to seeing Sara can we get, as fans of the show? You gonna be around for a while, or is this another hit and run? You gonna tease us and run off again? Another foreign country you gonna run off to?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I know, right? I keep having these really big, dramatic, goodbyes, and then &ndash; It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, gosh! It&rsquo;s her again!&rdquo; I think you can&rsquo;t pull that off that much before &ndash; I mean people are already rolling their eyes at me. They&rsquo;ve done that for years. That will continue, I think, if I keep saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &ldquo;But this time I mean it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;Send me flowers!&rdquo; No, I&rsquo;m visiting, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to do so. As I said, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it at all, especially after the Costa Rican episode. SO we&rsquo;ll see! We&rsquo;re taking it one day at a time. It&rsquo;s so much fun, it&rsquo;s like going home in some respects. In some respects it&rsquo;s like having a brand new job and being somewhere for the first time. I have so much love and devotion in my heart for everybody there.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How&rsquo;s Laurence Flishburn- Fishburne to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Laurence Flishburn?</p>

<p>[<em>Everyone laughs</em>]</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Laurence Flishburn.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Notable actor?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Yeah. I&rsquo;ve started drinking already. Laurence Fishburne, one of my favorite actors, and he&rsquo;s so good on the show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> He is! He&rsquo;s spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How exciting is it to work with that stature when you come back to a project like <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Very humbly. You know, Liev Schrieber guest stared a couple seasons ago too, and he and Fishburne would be two of my all time favorite actors. It&rsquo;s just kind of weird that all of the sudden they&rsquo;re sort of like at your house. You know? Like they knock on the door and you&rsquo;re like &lsquo;Hey, come on in! Would you like a cup of coffee?&rsquo; or something. He&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s as kind and benevolent and generous and sweet and funny as you could ever imagine that he might be.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> There&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve got smart guys and gals running the show. Because when you lose your star, when you lose Mr. Grissom&rsquo;s character, when you lose that you need a guy with &ndash; not only a great actor, but with gravitas. Who can come in and pick up the slack. And he has that. He&rsquo;s one of those guys, you can&rsquo;t take your eyes off the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Mesmerizing. And he&rsquo;s sicker than I am and he&rsquo;s in New York doing the press, so you&rsquo;ve gotta give him credit for that.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> He&rsquo;s spreading the virus on that coast.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We all have the <em>CSI</em> bug, it&rsquo;s very contagious.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> What did you do, when you left the show, about the show? Did you continue to watch it as a fan, or did you not want to see your boyfriend move on with another woman?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah! That was scary! And that happened a little bit. Sort of. They left that very ambiguous, thank God. I watched for a while and then I realized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on sabbatical. I&rsquo;m taking a year off.&rdquo; And then I kind of turned off my TV. So for the most part there was very little that I watched, including <em>CSI</em>, in that year. I did a bunch of traveling.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Wow! That&rsquo;s a surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I thought, if I&rsquo;m really gonna take a year off, as long as my heads in the game, if I&rsquo;m watching TV every night. But, when they called this summer, I had them TIVO&rsquo;d, most of them, and I did sit down at watch a lot of them. I still have a couple left to watch. I&rsquo;ve worked my way up to the season finale of last year, it&rsquo;s the one episode I haven&rsquo;t see yet. Which is weird, because we&rsquo;re premiering tonight, so I&rsquo;ve probably have to go home and watch it today! I have to watch it this afternoon! And I thought last season was amazing, I thought they did a really great job. It&rsquo;s really difficult to lose three characters in the space of a year or so. The writers are brilliant. I thought they handled very well, and I thought that &ndash; there hasn&rsquo;t been a ton of subtext on <em>CSI</em> the last year. Everybody&rsquo;s been grieving the loss of old people, and also hopeful of new folks coming in. I think that played on screen a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And plus, you just want to see McDreamy happy. Right?</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Not the same show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry, who are you? What radio show is this? Where am I?</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Big boy!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Here&rsquo;s a tweet question for you, Jorja. Eric wants to know if it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to act with all the special effects that they use on the show?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Eric. To be honest with you, I rarely see the special effects. We&rsquo;re generally in a stage, we&rsquo;re in a room. We see more &ndash; we see the stunts and the car wrecks and things like that. But a lot of the <em>CSI</em> stuff that they do comes in post-production, which is one of the reasons I actually really watch the show! Because so much of it happens in post. The music gets laid in post. We&rsquo;re really proud of our music, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of really amazing bands come through. And I like to watch everybody else&rsquo;s work and see what they did.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Tonight at nine on CBS. For folks who are gonna try <em>CSI</em> for the first time, or haven&rsquo;t been paying as close attention as they should, what is the 30-second setup that you give people that are prepared to sit down and watch <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Uh &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Ten years of work!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> That&rsquo;s not saying recap every plot point!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I gotta pitch it? I can say this. When I read the script this summer, I think, whenever you&rsquo;ve been on as long as we have &ndash; and we&rsquo;re ooooolllld now, I feel like we&rsquo;ve got canes and walkers and all kinds of stuff &hellip; Geritol. I read the script, I was excited I was coming back, and I was like, &ldquo;You know, this show&rsquo;s probably peaked. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s gonna be a great script.&rdquo; I thought it&rsquo;s probably &hellip; The best is in the past. And when I read the first page of the first scene, I was strapped into a seatbelt and I thought to myself &ldquo;Game. On.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Wow! That sounds great.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I&rsquo;m excited!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And I hope that Sara and Catherine will finally act on their long standing attraction to one another.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> That&rsquo;s been coming up a lot, actually!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s about time for that wrinkle to be &hellip; on <em>CSI</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Someone should get something on <em>CSI</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Exactly!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, sweeps have got to be right around the corner. Let&rsquo;s not be crazy here.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, Jorja, so nice to finally meet you. We&rsquo;ll happily take the Swine Flu from you-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Oh, great!</p>

<p><strong>Michael Barnes:</strong> Hi, I&rsquo;m Michael Barnes and I&rsquo;m here with actress, Jorja Fox. Jorja has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; and, most recently, &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;. Today we&rsquo;ll be playing excerpts of songs she selected that have inspired her over the years, as part of KCRW&rsquo;s Guest DJ Project.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Hi Michael. First of all, thank you so much for having me. I&rsquo;m a big fan, I&rsquo;m a little nervous. So what I finally did [for my song selections] is stick a little bit to a piano/keyboard theme. I kind of had to try and find something to sort of narrow it down. The first song I picked is &ldquo;Jet&rdquo;, which was written by Paul McCartney and done by Paul McCartney and Wings. I was at the Coachella Music Festival &ndash; Coachella &lsquo;09 &ndash; Paul McCartney headlined on Friday night, and I knew by the second verse of this first song that it was going to be one of the best concerts I had ever been to in my entire life. And he opened with &ldquo;Jet&rdquo;, so I figured I would open with &ldquo;Jet&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> You know, obviously, I could talk about The Beatles probably for about two weeks straight and not even come up for air. It was very hard to pick one song. I grew up with The Beatles. My brother was 12 years older than me, and when he went to college my mom got him an eight track, so he left me all of his albums and his 45âs, and I scored this giant Beatles collection.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> You just heard a sample from Paul McCartney and Wings. The song is &ldquo;Jet&rdquo;, picked by Jorja Fox, who is our guest here for KCRW&rsquo;s Guest DJ Project. What do you have next for us?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> This is a song called &ldquo;The Story&rdquo;, by the Matthew Herbert Big Band. Matthew Herbert has done a whole bunch of different genres of albums. I think this is his second compilation of big band music. I&rsquo;m a subscriber to KCRW, a proud subscriber, and I got the winter CD you guys give out to all of us that give to the station, and on it was this song. The first time I heard it, I was in rapture, like from the first couple of notes of this song.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> My father &ndash; I&rsquo;m gonna take you through a tour of my family I think at this point &ndash; my father is 85 years old, he lives in sunny Florida, he served in World War II, he&rsquo;s a huge, huge, huge music lover. My mother never cared for music at all, as a matter of fact, she would often argue with him to turn it off. So my love of music comes from my dad and my brother. My dad grew up with big bands and jazz, so from a very, very early age, I was exposed to that [genre] &ndash; it&rsquo;s kind of the only records he had. He still puts Brylcreem in his hair. And I feel really honored cuz growing up sort of in the seventies in a beach town in Florida, I would have never been exposed to big band and jazz if it hadn&rsquo;t been for my dad.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> You just heard an excerpt from Matthew Herbert Big Band. The name of the song is &ldquo;The Story&rdquo; from the most recent record, <em>There&rsquo;s Me and There&rsquo;s You</em>. And that was something that was picked by actress, Jorja Fox, who you may know from <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em> and, most recently, from <em>CSI</em> as Dr. Sara Sidle.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Oh, Doctor, I love that &ndash; scientist, technically.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> Scientist, okay.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> But yeah, kind of doctor, and a lot of people think cop. But I guess technically we were always scientists. We worked for the cops, but we weren&rsquo;t technically cops.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> There you go.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Obscure fact, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> So what do you have next for us, Jorja?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, this is where I start to get a little crafty. Again, because it was so hard to pick five songs, I started to find songs that I loved that were covered by artists that I love, in an effort to talk about more songs and more artists. My favorite band right now is a band called Hot Chip. I love them &ndash; they&rsquo;re so danceable, they&rsquo;re listenable, they&rsquo;re fun. I love their lyrics. [This is] one of the newer songs they have out that I&rsquo;m familiar with, I think was released in February of &lsquo;09. [It] is a cover of Joy Division&rsquo;s &ldquo;Transmission&rdquo;, which is on a great compilation album called <em>War Child: Heroes, Volume 1</em>. And what I had heard about it, which I think is so interesting, is the bands that were covered, actually picked the artist to cover their songs. So it&rsquo;s my understanding that the New Order guys picked Hot Chip to do a Joy Division cover. I love Joy Division, I love New Order, I love Hot Chip &ndash; here&rsquo;s &ldquo;Transmission&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I was lucky enough to grow up with this college radio station in Florida called WFIT. It&rsquo;s a small, small, small, small town where I came from &ndash; like one street with an ice cream parlor and that&rsquo;s about it. And we had this radio station &ndash; we sort of had a window to the entire world.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> Music from Hot Chip. &ldquo;Transmission&rdquo; is the name of the song, originally done by Joy Division and featured on <em>War Child: Heroes, Volume 1</em> collection, picked by our guest here at KCRW, actress Jorja Fox. What do you have next for us?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Ugh, next. Again growing up in Florida it was really sort of heavy rock alternative music time. And when I finally got to New York, I finally made some friends who were kind of my own age and they were listening to Joni Mitchell who, I think, is one of the better song writers that ever was and guitarist and pianist. This particular track is &ldquo;Black Crow&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s preformed and arranged by Diana Krall, who&rsquo;s one of my favorite contemporary jazz pianist artists right now. It&rsquo;s a song about traveling. It&rsquo;s a song about being on the road. But when I listen to it, I really feel like I&rsquo;m flying.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> &ldquo;Black Crow&rdquo;, by Joni Mitchell covered by Diana Krall.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I love music. I actually took up the drums about a year and a half ago. I&rsquo;m a very late beginner. In <em>CSI</em>, as a mater of fact, we had a lunch time band for the longest time. There are so many people that play music on <em>CSI</em>. And lunch is only a half hour and people would run to the food truck, like just run, and get the food and throw it in the trailers and then go into the stage and we&rsquo;d just leave our instruments there and we&rsquo;d have jams for as long, you know, until they&rsquo;d call us back to work and then you just eat your lunch cold throughout the day when you had time, you know?</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> You just heard a sample of Diana Krall doing Joni Mitchell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black Crow&rdquo;, you can find that on her album <em>The Girl in the Other Room</em> and that was selected by our guest here in the studios, actress Jorja Fox. So what do you have next for us?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> &ldquo;So Danco Samba&rdquo;, written of course by Getz and Gilberto. This particular version of it is my favorite. It&rsquo;s performed by Ella Fitzgerald and I was in Costa Rica last spring, I surf and I&rsquo;d been surfing all day in Costa Rica, and I get out of the water with my surfboard and I go down this tiny little hotel that had 20 tables set up in the sand on the beach, huge palm trees hanging over head, like 40-foot palm trees. And there is this gentleman, who is from Brazil. He&rsquo;s a one man band: he&rsquo;s got his drums, his percussion, his keyboard, his guitars. And what he does is he lays down a riff and it records itself so he can lay down the drums of what he wants to do, and then his keyboard sound. Then, he&rsquo;ll put in a little guitar &ndash; it&rsquo;s recorded as he&rsquo;s doing it right there. And I got to just sit there and watch the sun go down listening to this amazing musician. And he did a lot of Bossa Nova that night and my favorite moment was &ldquo;So Danco Samba.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> &ldquo;So Danco Samba&rdquo; by Ella Fitzgerald.</p>

<p><strong>MB:</strong> You just heard a selection of some master works from Ella Fitzgerald doing a song by Joao Gilberto. &ldquo;So Danco Samba&rdquo; is the name of the song. And that was something that was picked by our guest here in our studio, actress Jorja Fox. Thank you so much for joining us here at KCRW.com for the Guest DJ Project.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It was great, good luck with this project, it was so fun!</p>

<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> &hellip; tell us about puppy mills?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, probably a lot of things. I think that puppy mills - it&rsquo;s a very easy issue. You know, if people were more aware, if they knew more, it would be a given issue. Just because we used to put asbestos in our walls, and we used to put lead in our paint, and it was a great idea at the time, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s still a great idea. Puppy mills are places where, all they do, month after month, year after year, is breed dogs to sell to pet stores. And most of these dogs are kept in very, very cramped cages their entire lives, they never see the sun, they usually have diseases, they have one job that they do. And, of course, because they&rsquo;re dogs, they do it really well. I mean dogs, I think we all know, love humans and love to make humans happy and will do whatever it takes to please the person that they&rsquo;re living with. The conditions are awful. As soon as dogs aren&rsquo;t valuable anymore, they&rsquo;re put down, often they end up at the bottom of lakes. I mean it&rsquo;s really a sad, tragic story.</p>

<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> How- &ldquo;why&rdquo; are you such an animal advocate?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I wish I could put that into logical terms. I&rsquo;ve always been an animal lover. I grew up in a very small town. I grew up on the ocean. The people that live in the small town were very - the environment was necessary for everybody&rsquo;s survival, it was a fishing town and it was a tourist town. So it was very important, even in the early 70s when I was growing up, that if we didn&rsquo;t care for the place that we lived in, everybody&rsquo;s job would go away. So that&rsquo;s connection number 1, that we were all connected. Similarly, I think more than ever, now the wild places on earth are getting smaller and smaller and I think that it&rsquo;s all time for us to have a little bit more compassion and to protect those places. Not only because animals are really cool and funny and beautiful and gorgeous and magical, but because if we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> protect those spaces, we&rsquo;re not going to have a space either. We don&rsquo;t survive if they&rsquo;re not surviving.</p>

<p><strong>Voiceover:</strong> Jorja Fox was even there. She is making her return to the show this season.</p>

<p><strong>Dayna Roselli:</strong> Did you ever think, in the beginning, that it would be going on this long?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No! Never in a million years. Nor did I ever think, in a million years, that there&rsquo;d be a museum that has our mugs in it, in Vegas. It&rsquo;s really - we&rsquo;re all very overwhelmed and touched and thrilled to be here.</p>
