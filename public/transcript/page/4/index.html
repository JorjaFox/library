<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> Our first guest made a name for herself playing strong female characters on shows like ER and The West Wing, and has been solving crimes for more than a decade as analyst Sara Sidle on the most watched TV show in the world: CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Take a look.</p>

<p>[Clip from &ldquo;Sheltered&rdquo;]</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Please welcome Jorja Fox!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &hellip; two hour The Talk special today?</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Oh yes, we&rsquo;re taking over the network. Two hour special, Affiliates take notice.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s so much to talk about</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> I know!</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Well we were just talking about disastrous vacations, in light of Heidi Klum&rsquo;s son almost drowning in the ocean. Have you ever had a disastrous vacation?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> You know, I had to really &#8212; I&rsquo;ve had so many disastrous, I had sort of sit and think about which one I wanted to talk about. Nothing nearly as excited as yours [Sharon Osborne]. I am also prone to food poisoning on the road. My family went to Europe when I was 13, I went with my mom and my dad and my grandmother, who was in her y&rsquo;know late seventies, eighties, at the time. And we take the train to Paris and, you guys have probably done this, there are several stops and we hit like &#8216;Paris North.&rsquo; And the worst part is my family speaks French. So we put my grandmother on the platform and we&rsquo;re passing bags out, like twelve bags, and the train leaves. So not only do we leave my grandmother on the platform in Paris, but it&rsquo;s the wrong platform. It isn&rsquo;t even Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> [laughing] Oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It took about two and a half hours to circle back, go back an get her. My mom was in tears, she thought she was going to have a heart attack, she&rsquo;s all alone. But she was just kind of sitting on the bags with a cappuccino. Enjoying the day. [group laughter] Yeah, that&rsquo;s my favorite disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Now, you actually had another experience in Europe, before you became an actress, when you were seventeen you moved to Italy, right? To try and be a model.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yes, &#8216;try&rsquo; is the operative word.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> But how did that go? I heard you almost ended up homeless?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know where you heard that rumor, but it&rsquo;s one of the true ones. You know, this is- My manager sent me with five-hundred dollars and said &ldquo;Take $500, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of money, you&rsquo;re going to start working right away with Seventeen.&rdquo; And I was partnered up with another model, who was all of 21, and she was going to be the smart one, you know, and sort of the savvy one. And we get there and she tells me she had <em>two</em>-hundred dollars, she didn&rsquo;t tell anyone she only had $200. We had $700, even in the 80s, in Europe, you&rsquo;re out of money pretty fast. We got kicked out of our pension and, quite honestly, a young American architectural student in Milan saved my life and let me live with him for five or six weeks, until- It was sort of the closet I ever experienced college dorm life, with a student in Milan.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> And then you moved into one of those model &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yeah, we got on our feet- We did start working. It took a little longer than we thought. And yeah, we moved into a model&rsquo;s pension, which was also like my &#8216;college&rsquo; experience.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It happened to be a girls pension, a woman&rsquo;s pension and I was one of the youngest there. Women would sneak their boyfriends in several times a week, which was kind of fun. But one of the things I loved the most, and there was so much traveling at that age, you know everybody kind of looked after each other, but there were women there from all over the world, and young girls, and &#8212; All of them, we&rsquo;d go out to dinner and you could be from Thailand, and maybe you&rsquo;re from Iceland, and you&rsquo;re from France, and everyone would speak in English together. Broken English. So the conversations were pretty simple &#8212; not because we were models &#8212; there was a launguage-</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> You joined the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation very- in the year it debuted and- [applause] Yes, and I was on it!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Alma Mater!</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> &#8212; And I loved working there. It was an incredible show. And it&rsquo;s so hard to believe that you&rsquo;re wrapping up the thirteenth season of the show. It&rsquo;s incredible for any actor to have a job for this long and to be so successful.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t happen! It just- You know when you go to acting school they prepare you. You know, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go from job to job to job to job. It&rsquo;s just kind of the nature of the business.&rdquo; And so this is a complete anomoly. None of us are prepared for it.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Does your kind of crime scene investigating skills from the show start to creep into your real life [laughter] after this long?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [faux dramatic] I know all the secrets of everyone here.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Osborne:</strong> Last season, Ted Danson joined the cast. And we love him in the show. He&rsquo;s such an amazing guy. I mean, it must be such a joy to work with him every day.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [deadpan] He&rsquo;s a terror. He&rsquo;s horrible.</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Osborne:</strong> He&rsquo;s naughty!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> He&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s amazing! He&rsquo;s one of these gentlemen, you know he&rsquo;s been in the business for years, he&rsquo;s one of my heroes as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we&rsquo;d know each other ten years. He&rsquo;s a master at intimacy. It&rsquo;s not forced, it&rsquo;s authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I swear he&rsquo;s got wings on. Like under his jacket, there&rsquo;s wings. He is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>[group &#8216;awwww&rsquo; and applause]</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s coming out later this year, and you&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&rdquo; Tell us about that.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you for asking about that. It&rsquo;s a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you&rsquo;re from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person <em>can</em> make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it&rsquo;s a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

		<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Oh dear! Jorja Fox, who plays Sara Sidle, seems to be in some hot water tonight on CSI</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> Jorja, welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Hi.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> And your character seems to be in a little bit of trouble. What&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You know, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. It&rsquo;s just a little misunderstanding!</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> What&rsquo;d you get up to?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It gets completely blown out of proportion. You know, Sara&rsquo;s universe kind of implodes tonight. I&rsquo;m nervous about it. I hope the fans enjoy it. It&rsquo;s a very scary, dark, terrible wormhole.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Kind of on the other side. They&rsquo;re looking for your DNA.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah! It impacted me a lot deeper than I thought it would. I&rsquo;ve done this for a long time with a lot of guest actors, with lots of different stories, and it was the first time in all- I&rsquo;m looking at it differently now. If I have to process somebody, or if I&rsquo;m interrogating someone, it&rsquo;s a hat that I wore for one night that I can&rsquo;t ever go back from. I think I have more empathy than I did. Which is kind of &#8212; My character&rsquo;s always had a lot of empathy in the show, and now I feel even more for people.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> It is incredible when you think about it. That this is the most watched television show in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> In the world.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Not in America. In the world. In it&rsquo;s thirteenth season. You&rsquo;ve been there since the very beginning. Give us some stats. How many murders have you solved?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Personally?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> People have died a lot on your show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> That&rsquo;s an even scarier question. I think one of the &#8212; I have no idea how many murders we&rsquo;ve solved. I think &hellip; How many murders <em>haven&rsquo;t</em> we solved? That one I can probably answer. It&rsquo;s like six.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> People are looking for new crazy kinds.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Six times we haven&rsquo;t-</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Oh that you haven&rsquo;t gotten the-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> That we haven&rsquo;t gotten our person, or that we&rsquo;ve had a couple serial killers over the years and it&rsquo;s taken us a while to get. But we&rsquo;ve been really lucky, we get most of them.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> There&rsquo;s a bunch of versions of you around the world, by the way. Is is weird watching yourself, in like, Mandarin?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s amazing. I&rsquo;ll see it and I&rsquo;ll like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so smart!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> You just get to a hotel, you turn on a TV, and there you are.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s weird to be fluent in almost every language on earth. Not me, but the version of me. Sara is fluent in pretty much every language on earth. That&rsquo;s a huge compliment. It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> You&rsquo;re also fluent in many genres of this business. Because you&rsquo;re also producing an off-Broadway play right now. What&rsquo;s it like to put that hat on?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s been a huge learning experience. The show is [[Forever Dusty]] and it&rsquo;s an off-Broadway musical in New York. Obviously musicals are a complete left turn for me, I come from, I like to think, comedy and drama, but more drama. That scene you just played is actually the funniest scene in the whole episode. It&rsquo;s been fascinating. New York City is my home town, and I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do a project there. We&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s funny and beautiful and deep. It&rsquo;s about the singer, Dusty Springfield, so if you like her music, it&rsquo;s all you need, you&rsquo;re gonna have a great time there.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> Why are people still obsessed with William Petersen, and the fact that there could&rsquo;ve, would&rsquo;ve, should&rsquo;ve been something&hellip; what is the fascination-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You mean my husband? My television husband? Yeah, cause Sara and Grissom are&hellip; Well. He&rsquo;s been a little disracted lately, and it has been really interesting. I think I&rsquo;ve done the show three seasons now without him, and never imagined I&rsquo;d possible-</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> That&rsquo;s the thing. People are still like &ldquo;Well? Well? What&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> All roads lead to Grissom. From the beginning, middle and end of this show, I think that always our protagonist, the person that the audience- We followed through his eyes. And I think it&rsquo;s a tremendous compliment, and it&rsquo;s still true today, that we kind of are still following the whole story through his eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> Will he ever come back?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I would love to answer that question, but I&rsquo;m not gonna.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> I like that you know something! I love that! People come here, and they know stuff, and they&rsquo;re all &ldquo;Ha ha! Can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yep, just a little Cheshire Cat. But there will be some Sara and Grissom information in the episode tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Oh, I thought &ldquo;Sara information&rdquo; &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Fraizer:</strong> William Peterson&rsquo;s gonna pop on! He&rsquo;s going to be there!</p>

<p><strong>Thea Andrews:</strong> Well thank you. Thirteen seasons, going strong, congratulations.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Hello! Hi, I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s going to have to read everything, as Marg knows.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger:</strong> It&rsquo;s what you do.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah. I&rsquo;m so happy for you. I had the very good fortune of meeting Marg Helgenberger in July of 2000, just as we were embarking on what would prove to be one of the signature adventures of our lives. Over the course of these last twelve years, we&rsquo;ve shared some of the best and most exciting times a person can have. It&rsquo;s been kind of like riding one of those magic carpet rides that you read about when you were a kid. We were blessed. We won the number one show in the world title again last year. There&rsquo;s been mountains of accolades, parties, trips, award nominations, awards, critical acclaim, magazine covers, games, museum exhibits, dolls, and there&rsquo;s been lots of very, very, hard work. Sometimes in the dark, or the cold, or the rain [laughter].</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been loss, too. Loss of partnerships, both professional and personal. Loss of beloved pets, loss of our younger selves. And the toughest, of course, loss of loved ones along the way. Through it all, Marg&rsquo;s been an unshakable rock, a fearless leader, a devoted cheerleader, and very often the brains of our operations. Marg sets the bar sky scraper high for the rest of us, without making us feel small. She can wade through a landfill in the morning, and slip into an evening gown by dinner time without missing a single beat. She&rsquo;s tough as nails, smooth as silk, easy like Sunday morning, and steady as she goes.</p>

<p>I think she&rsquo;s touched every single person she&rsquo;s met along the way. She&rsquo;s generous, she&rsquo;s giving, and she&rsquo;s an amazing listener, wether she&rsquo;s hanging with old coast executives at a swanky event or hanging out in a ditch somewhere with our unseen, heroic, crew, or hanging out in a hospital with women who&rsquo;ve been struck with breast cancer.</p>

<p>Now, I know I don&rsquo;t have to tell you how talented Marg Helgenberger is. Her craftsmanship is legendary and <em>very</em> well documented. But I will gloat for a minute about getting to watch her perform on a daily basis. She lights up any corner of the world that she&rsquo;s in, and brings an authenticity and intimacy to every scene that she does that is simply dazzling to watch. Speaking for your <em>CSI</em> tribe today, and there are many of us that are here. Give yourselves a shout out! We love you. We&rsquo;re <strong>SO</strong> going to miss working with you in the near future. And we wish you the absolute best going forward at everything you do. I, for one, am willing to wager a large, Vegas, bet that this is just Marg&rsquo;s Professional Halftime Show. After all, you do have to stop and smell the roses.</p>

<p>We have a pretty epic football pool at work. When the guys need help with their picks, <em>Marg</em> is the first person that they ask. Marg&rsquo;s also the first person the guys ask to dance at our seasonal parties. Marg is an&hellip; anomaly. She&rsquo;s a broad, she&rsquo;s a dame, and she&rsquo;s a lady. And I am very proud to call her my friend.</p>

<p>Congrats, Marg, Hollywood Boulevard&rsquo;s going to shine even brighter tonight, now that you are a fixture on the scene.</p>
