      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lithe and attractive brunette American actress Jorja Fox entered the public eye in the late &amp;lsquo;90s and early 2000s, given her involvement as a recurrent cast member in three consecutive, top-ranked U.S. television series: ER (1994), The West Wing (1999), and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000). Fox is perhaps most familiar to fans of CSI, appearing in well over 150 episodes and numerous seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born Jorja-An Fox on July 7, 1968, in New York, NY, but raised in Melbourne Beach, FL, Fox moved back to Manhattan in her teens and began a modeling career after winning a local modeling contest, then subsequently enrolled as a drama student at the Lee Strasberg Institute, where she studied acting under the aegis of legendary actor William Hickey (Prizzi&amp;rsquo;s Honor, Forget Paris). Fox&amp;rsquo;s early roles were minor and somewhat forgettable, though she debuted onscreen under the tutelage one of the finest American indie filmmakers &amp;#8212; Maggie Greenwald &amp;#8212; in that director&amp;rsquo;s well-received film noir debut The Kill-Off (1991). She followed it up with an equally dark turn, as Fate 3 (alongside future West Wing co-star Allison Janney), in John Feldman&amp;rsquo;s little-seen black comedy thriller Dead Funny (1995), and joined mentor Hickey and Alan Arkin for the best-forgotten Jerky Boys (1995) &amp;#8212; a loud, rude and obnoxious farce about a couple of prank phone callers. The film bombed with critics and the public, and disappeared instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox joined the cast of the blockbuster series ER in 1996, during its third season on the air. She played Maggie Doyle, a lesbian intern at County General Hospital who launches a sexual harassment suit against a seemingly invincible administrator. The role lasted for three seasons, wrapping in 1999; that same year, Fox signed for a supporting role on The West Wing, mega-producer Aaron Sorkin&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster series drama about life in the Oval Office. In that series, Fox played Gina Toscano, the Secret Service agent hired to protect first daughter Zoey Bartlet (Elisabeth Moss) during the first and second seasons (1999-2001).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox&amp;rsquo;s prominence rose with her comparatively higher billing in the hit CBS-Alliance-Atlantis series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She joined the cast of that series from its inception, as Sara Sidle, a maverick investigator who specializes in materials and elements analysis. As the series opened, team leader Gil Grissom (William Petersen) called Sidle in from her post at the San Francisco coroner&amp;rsquo;s office to investigate the death of former CSI team member Holly Gribbs. After the unit solved that case, Grissom, impressed with her work, invited her to stay on board and solve additional cases. Series writers imparted an added dimension to Sidle&amp;rsquo;s character by revealing a backstory that involved the spousal abuse of her father, her mother&amp;rsquo;s decision to commit mariticide, and her own entry into foster care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few small appearances here and there in films like The Jerky Boys led her to a full time position as Dr. Maggie Doyle, the highly competitive new doctor in the ER, and lesbian foil to Noah Wyle&amp;rsquo;s John Carter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that security under her belt, she has worked on a few films here and there, and is now working double duty, working on both CSI, as Sara Sidle, and The West Wing, who&amp;rsquo;s smart talking Special Agent Gina Tuscano is no large step from Maggie Doyle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adept at playing smart, strong women, this former teen model segued to acting with guest spots in after-school specials and evening dramas. A comely, gap-toothed brunette whose good looks can&amp;rsquo;t obscure her intelligence or hard-nosed attitude, Fox became a small-screen star with a trio of plum prime-time parts. In the mid-&amp;lsquo;90s she had a recurring role as a blunt doctor on ER who turned out to be a lesbian and — like Fox — a vegetarian. In a sly nod to her character&amp;rsquo;s sexual orientation, the actress had a cameo on the famous 1997 &amp;ldquo;coming out&amp;rdquo; episode of Ellen. In 2000 Fox appeared on a different NBC drama as a Secret Service agent on The West Wing, but later that year she jumped networks when she signed on to CBS&amp;rsquo; CSI as a dedicated investigator. Although the show turned her into a bold-faced name, behind-the-scenes bickering threatened to cut her run short: In 2004, she and costar George Eads were briefly fired during a contract dispute. Three years later during another salary standoff, Fox refused to show up to shoot the series&amp;rsquo; seventh season finale when she learned that her alter ego would be killed off. The episode was reshot with a more ambiguous ending.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This biography was released before The Hungry Bachelors Club was renamed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Her television credits also include guest leads on Law and Order and most recently, a pilot for Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, Flesh and Blood. While THE HUNGRY BACHELORS CLUB marks Fox&amp;rsquo;s theatrical debut in a leading role, she is no stranger to film, having appeared in VELOCITY TRAP, ALCHEMY, HOW TO MAKE THE CRUELEST MONTH and TIARA TANGO, among others. Fox studied theatre and appeared onstage in New York and Los Angeles. She formed Honeypot Productions, a theatrical troupe in Los Angeles that presents one-act plays.
