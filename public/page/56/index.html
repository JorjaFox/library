		<p>*CSI *fans got a real treat this season when former series-regular <strong>William Petersen</strong> returned for a brief cameo. The mastermind behind that story, 2008 Genesis Award Winner <strong>Christopher Barbour</strong>, graciously took a break from his busy schedule this afternoon to speak to me exclusively on how they got Grissom back, Catherine&rsquo;s future, and a big showdown between Nate Haskell and Ray Langston. <strong>Spoilers a plenty after the jump!</strong></p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Some pretty major events happened in your last episode &ldquo;The Two Mrs. Grissoms.&rdquo; With the show eleven seasons into its run, what made the writers decide to do an episode with a heavy focus on Grissom (<strong>William Petersen</strong>), even though he is no longer a series-regular?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: (laughs) Yes, indeed. We love <strong>Jorja Fox</strong> and Sara. And obviously, Sara being married to Grissom, there was a need to address how that relationship works in some way, shape, or form. We are a procedural show so it&rsquo;s more difficult to sort of delve deeply into the lives of the characters. You usually get suggestions and snippets of that. In the beginning, the episode was more focused on Sara and her relationships. I was actually surprised that we were able to get Billy to come back and do the cameo; I was thrilled.</p>

<p>I feel very fortunate. I&rsquo;m not just a writer on the show, but I was always a fan of the show. So it was sort of a dream job. Billy&rsquo;s a fine actor and I can understand wanting to move on to other projects, I think Jorja really reached out to him. She had done that for him in &ldquo;Leave Out All The Rest,&rdquo; and he asked her &#8216;do you mind doing this one video segment?&rsquo; and she said &#8216;sure!&lsquo;. So she reached out to him and it was really a surprise. I guess in the back of my mind and probably <strong>Treena Hancock</strong> and <strong>Melissa Byer</strong>&#8216;s mind that we <em>might</em> have an opening if Billy didn&rsquo;t mind making a phone call or being on Skype. In my mind I didn&rsquo;t think it was going to happen.</p>

<p>We wanted it to be a surprise to the audience. People go &#8216;oh, why didn&rsquo;t you promote it?&lsquo;. I guess from my point of view I like the idea that it might&rsquo;ve been something that was a surprise. It sends a signal that you should watch the show because you never know what you&rsquo;re going to see. I also didn&rsquo;t want people to think that we were jerking them around because he&rsquo;s not in a lot of it. I didn&rsquo;t want people to be disappointed. Hopefully you get a sense of how they stay in contact while in a long-distance relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Was it scripted from the beginning to have him return?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: No, not at all. Not at all. We thought about meeting the mother-in-law because of the concept of returning to the deaf school. The possibility of having <strong>Marlee Matlin</strong> as a guest-star. That all sort of gestated together, and then the possibility of having Billy coming was late in that process. There was a possibility of doing the episode without him; I think it&rsquo;s so much better with him. It&rsquo;s very hard to talk <em>around</em> him, and we were very fortunate that he agreed to do the show. It might have felt a little empty if we had done that episode, met his mother, seen the relationship between mother-in-law and Sara, yet not see Grissom. (laughs<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>)</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: How hard was it to get him back?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: (laughs) Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think it was that hard. I know that Jorja had reached out to him. I don&rsquo;t know how hard in the sense in that he has moved on to other things- it was really more of a scheduling question. I think in regards to him making guest appearances the door has always been open.</p>

<p>I think he was more than happy to accommodate it, which I thought was very nice.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: From a technical standpoint how difficult was it to incorporate the sign language into the script?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: It&rsquo;s interesting in that regard. We wanted people to really feel that world as much as we can get them into that world. From my point of view I like the twists and turns of an episode, but I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of hiding the bad guy as the translator because he was someone that would be present for us and necessary for us in order to communicate.</p>

<p>We were interested in the notion that there were different types of sign language; I don&rsquo;t think people really think about that. We had some people around to help us make it authentic, and then certainly having Marlee Matlin along was very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: A few weeks back we got a sense that Langston (<strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong>) might be going to the &#8216;dark side.&rsquo; (<em>Barbour laughs</em>) He&rsquo;s clearly having a rough time with serial killer Nate Haskell (<strong>Bill Irwin</strong>), and from what I can tell he&rsquo;s reached his breaking point. At what point is he finally going to snap?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: Well, we will be bringing Nate back. He is not done tormenting Langston yet. That is what we&rsquo;re working on as I speak, without giving anything away. Bill Irwin is an actor we&rsquo;re really excited to have as a part of the show and he will be returning. Hopefully, it will be a satisfying run as we approach the end of the season.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Fun times for Langston-</p>

<p>**Barbour: **(laughs)</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: There&rsquo;s been some interesting discussion on the Internet that Ray&rsquo;s ex-wife Gloria (<strong>Tracee Ellis Ross</strong>) could somehow end up in the Langston/Haskell showdown. Care to comment on that?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: I would say that that is a possibility. (laughs) We&rsquo;re exploring the possibility of what would Haskell do to antagonize Langston.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Is Tracee contracted for future episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know that for a fact. But we are exploring–I think we&rsquo;d like her to come back.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: One of the things I read was that Haskell might pull a <strong>Kevin Spacey</strong> moment from *SE7EN *and delivers Gloria&rsquo;s head in a box to Langston-</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: (laughs) The CBS-approved not-too-grotesque version. (laughs) We have had decapitated heads on the show before. (laughs) Perhaps. Without trying to give anything away, I think it&rsquo;s just about Haskell upsetting him and with the potential for Langston to become very dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: <strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> (who plays current CSI supervisor Catherine Willows) had made it clear that she plans on leaving after this season. Has an exit-storyline been put into place?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: We are segueing her off and I think we&rsquo;re still developing how that might happen. And also the possibility that we leave the door open should she decide to stay.</p>

<p>Not only do we love Marg, but the character Catherine Willows is very important. And to leave the door open for the possibility of her to be back is and when she leaves. Not all of the things have certainly been settled yet. When those things are settled we would want to develop a storyline to usher her off the show in a style that she deserves.</p>

<p>I have to say just speaking as a fan she is always going to be an important part of the show. And like Grissom, she&rsquo;ll still be referenced as it seems like she&rsquo;s going off to bigger and better things.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: What are the chances Catherine will stay in a successful relationship with Vartann (<strong>Alex Carter</strong>)?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know. Well, tune in tonight! There will be an interesting development in tonight&rsquo;s episode (&ldquo;The List,&rdquo; written by <strong>Richard Catalani</strong>). I think that&rsquo;s one of things we&rsquo;re dealing with as the weeks and months proceed; what kind of relationship she wants to have and what the future is for her. What other possibilities are there for her and with someone like Vartann.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: <strong>Melinda Clarke</strong> and <strong>Louise Lombard</strong> are returning as Lady Heather and Sofia Curtis, respectively. What are the chances they&rsquo;ll stick around long-term to help add a little more female blood to the cast?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: As far as Lady Heather I think the door, again, is left open for her. We found a storyline that was appropriate to bring her back; she is a favorite of ours. With Sofia, I think there&rsquo;s a possibility to return again- even before the end of the season. But that hasn&rsquo;t been settled.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Will Sofia be coming back as the deputy-chief of Las Vegas or another town?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: In Las Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Do you happen to have a favorite character to write for? Your two episodes so far this season, &ldquo;House of Hoarders&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Two Mrs Grissoms,&rdquo; happen to have lots of Sara involvement. And I have to say, you do a fantastic job writing her character.</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: Thank you. I don&rsquo;t know if I necessarily have a favorite character to write for. I&rsquo;m a fan of all the characters and like the family component of the show. In &ldquo;House of Hoarders,&rdquo; I liked how I could focus how each one contributes to the whole and each one&rsquo;s response to a certain thing.</p>

<p>There is something that I&rsquo;m drawn to Sara about her past and her working through those issues. And in &ldquo;Hoarders&rdquo; Nick (<strong>George Eads</strong>) and Sara&rsquo;s response to that environment was something that I was interested in exploring. I like how they&rsquo;re CSIs and this group of people who interact given certain circumstances, and work together to solve these problems.</p>

<p>(<em>Barbour notes here that when he reads the blogs, he discovers fans who aren&rsquo;t necessarily in favor of team conflict. He says it&rsquo;s nice to see a team work together through their problems.</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: That kind of segue ways into my next question: If Sara sticks around full-time next season, is there a chance we&rsquo;ll get a little more backstory involving Sara&rsquo;s mother?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: There&rsquo;s always that possibility. I hope so. For our show we like doing a mystery every week and to find the right cases that will illuminate our characters is always a challenge. I think you will see more of that [backstory]. I am not at purview as to who is coming and going, I just know that we are all close from actors to writers to crew. We all love working with each other which is really great. If Jorja should stay, we&rsquo;ll definitely try to explore that backstory.</p>

<p>**Saunders: **Finally, as the show reaches the home stretch of season 11, what can viewers expect to see during the remainder of this season&rsquo;s 22 episode order?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: There definitely will be a big showdown between Nate Haskell and Ray Langston and the team. That will hopefully be exciting and surprising for everyone and everyone will be surprised at the outcome of that.</p>

<p><strong>Saunders</strong>: Is Anthony Zuiker (the creator of <em>CSI</em>) planning on bringing Sqweegel back?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: That is true. We may be revisiting Sqweegel.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:e082cd986e1ce98e3bf23846c5680f18">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The CSIs are on zombie alert when two men initially pronounced dead mysteriously come back to life. The first dead body walks out of the morgue, while the second is found in an alley and vanishes by the time CSI gets there. The CSIs trace the evidence to Dr. Elliot Davis Aden, a discredited psychoanalyst who worked for the government during the Red Scare, until he fell into the lure of drugs.</p>

<p>Dr. Aden also conducted re-animation experiments. When they go back to Dr. Aden&rsquo;s closed lab on UNLV campus, they find that people have been performing &lsquo;independent study&rsquo; into Dr. Aden&rsquo;s work on death. When the CSIs find the ID and wearable camcorder of Max Ferris (the morgue zombie), one of the &lsquo;dead&rsquo; men, they learn he and his friends, Kurt Dawson (the alley zombie) and Alice Katsu, took drugs to simulate death. Kurt&rsquo;s body is found in Dr. Aden&rsquo;s old sensory deprivation tank on campus.</p>

<p>They finally find Max at the grave of Alice&rsquo;s mother, hoping to find Alice. When they try to arrest him, he runs and is killed by a car. Alice, as it happens, was in contact with Dr. Aden, and was picked up by him whilst on her trip. The CSIs determine that Dr. Aden was providing Alice with the drugs and documents, and now, following the death of her two compatriots, took a large dose of the drugs, rendering himself comatose.</p>

<p>At long last, they find Alice. Having returned to the campus, Alice went to Dr. Aden&rsquo;s old lab and is alive and well. She hallucinated seeing her mother, and felt better, totally unaware of the death of Kurt and Max.</p>

<p>Sara processes the alley where the second body walks away. She and Ray go to talk to Dr. Aden, bringing him back to the lab. Later, Sara and Catherine investigate Alice&rsquo;s house. Sara&rsquo;s very friendly with and amused by Dr. Aden.</p>

		<p><strong>(CNN) &#8212;</strong> Two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia have a new home in Colorado, where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Animal Defenders International (ADI) brought them last week to Denver, where they were transported to the Wild Animal Sanctuary, to conclude its &ldquo;Operation Lion Ark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in Bolivia that bans the use of any animals in circuses.</p>

<p>The 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000-square-foot temporary biosphere, complete with grass, trees and other natural features, at the sanctuary in Keenesburg, about 30 miles northeast of Denver.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re sleeping better, are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison, &ldquo;which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected,&rdquo; said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>The ADI campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from TV game show host Bob Barker.</p>

<p>Barker and actress Jorja Fox of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; described the campaign Wednesday night on HLN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jane Velez-Mitchell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish quickly,&rdquo; Fox said of the law and the rescue of the lions, which were part of eight circuses.</p>

<p>Of the 25 lions, 24 were seized from circuses, many the traveling variety. Eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck, Fox said, and at least two had never seen other lions.</p>

<p>The sanctuary is building a permanent 80-acre fenced site for the lions, which will live in four prides, Craig told CNN.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll get along just fine with the climate in Colorado, he said, because they are exposed to the cold in North Africa.</p>

<p>Living in Bolivia put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late March or April.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter,&rdquo; said Fox.</p>

<p>The 320-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses more than 275 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats.</p>

<p>The Wild Animal Sanctuary emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary, not for entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a home for animals, not a zoo for people,&rdquo; Craig said.<br />
Animal rights activists and groups are optimistic that Bolivia&rsquo;s 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals,&rdquo; Barker told HLN.</p>

<p>The sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit, Craig said. &ldquo;We hope they become long-term contributors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility, which costs about $2.5 million a year to operate, were in the United States when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations, he added.</p>

<p>Most of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That&rsquo;s largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population.</p>

<p>Lionesses receive estrogen implants so that they won&rsquo;t go into heat. That reduces the competition and fighting among males.</p>

<p>Craig praised Bolivia for taking action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first country that stepped up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>He expects Peru, Ecuador and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues. Cities and states in the United States are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores, according to Craig.</p>

<p>The 25 lions are adjusting well, appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations, they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening,&rdquo; Craig told CNN. &ldquo;There is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom, so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present. This will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats, when they can complete their journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>TIM PHILLIPS, ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL: These lions have lived their life in a tiny, rusting, disgusting cage on the back of a lorry. Tomorrow they&rsquo;re going to feel the wind blow in their face. They&rsquo;re going to feel grass beneath their feet. They&rsquo;re going to roam into the bushes. They&rsquo;re going to do whatever they want. They&rsquo;re going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Tonight, an unprecedented flight to freedom for 25 magnificent animals. Bravo. Abused lions rescued from hideous conditions in Bolivia are now living out their lives in an amazing Colorado sanctuary. Last week&rsquo;s operation was the largest ever rescue of its kind. It could not have been done without the help of two amazing animal-loving celebrity who join me right here on ISSUES tonight. I&rsquo;m talking about my dear friends and my heroes, Bob Barker and Jorja Fox.</p>

<p>Now, when Jorja is not busy solving murders on CSI &#8212; come on, how many episodes have you seen her on, right? This time she is investigating real life crimes against animals.</p>

<p>And of course, Bob Barker is a legend from &ldquo;The Price is Right&rdquo; fame. You know, he is my hero because he helped pay for this massive rescue mission. I think he gave something like $200,000. He is an amazing, amazing hero for the animals and he&rsquo;s long time vegetarian and just an activist all the way around for these animals.</p>

<p>Listen to this.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>BOB BARKER, ANIMAL ACTIVITIES: Help control the pet population, have your pet spayed or neutered.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. Have your pet spayed and neutered. That&rsquo;s his famous line.</p>

<p>Straight out to my dear friends: Jorja Fox and Bob Barker; Jorja, going to start with you. First of all, bravo to all of you, to both of you and the organizations involved for getting these animals out.</p>

<p>Tell us about the conditions that these poor, poor lions have endured for their entire lives. What did you get them out of, Jorja?</p>

<p>JORJA FOX, ANIMAL ACTIVIST: Jane, thank you so much for having us. Again it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be with you.</p>

<p>To give you a few examples we had eight lions, a pride of lions, a whole family living together. This is adult lions, living on the back of a truck, the size of two double beds. That&rsquo;s one example of the conditions of these animals.</p>

<p>Another lion had been in a very small zoo cage for 11 years; hadn&rsquo;t seen another lion in all of that time. Two other lions had never seen another lion before; they were kept in small cages in circuses all by themselves.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Some of these lions, literally as you just heard, never set foot outside a small, filthy cage. Now, take a look at these conditions. No surprise that many were malnourished, stressed and traumatized. But within days of being rescued they were healthier, they were less aggressive, they had shiny coats even. Listen to this.</p>

<p>Bob Barker, again, you gave $200,000 to help make this happen. You are my hero. What runs through you emotionally when you see these animals taken from this hellish situation and put in this fabulous sanctuary where they literally have a 15,000 square foot biosphere to live out their lives as if in nature? Bob.</p>

<p>All right. Jorja, went to take that one?</p>

<p>FOX: Yes, I just wanted you to know that the biosphere is actually temporary. It is 15,000 square it, it has heat, it&rsquo;s got grass inside, it has toys. This is merely a space for the lions to acclimate to the Denver climate.</p>

<p>In a couple months they will have 80 full acres to share there. The animal sanctuary, a wild animal sanctuary north of Denver has two other lion prides. And it was a surprise to me to find out that lions actually are genetically wired for winter as they traversed Africa they spent a lot of time in the mountains in northern Africa, it gets very cold. So this will be a great place for them. But because they&rsquo;re just out of Bolivia they&rsquo;re going to stay a little warmer until the weather warms up a bit.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: well, I want to go to my big issue. I got to say, zoos are basically prisons. Ok. That is my opinion. It is easy to criticize other nations where zoos are terrible.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about the United States. We have countless animals, like Billy the elephant, he is the subject of a huge battle. He is stuck in concrete enclosure at the L.A. Zoo with no companion. See the way they&rsquo;re rocking like that. That is a sign of distress.</p>

<p>These animals are not meant to live this way, Bob Barker. What would you say to anybody who goes to a zoo?</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, let me say first, that I have heard nothing that has been said thus far. So, I don&rsquo;t know what you have asked me. I understand you&rsquo;ve been talking.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL:L Tell me about the zoos, Bob, come on. Tell us about the zoos and why you are against them?</p>

<p>BARKER: I am against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals. And the Los Angeles Zoo has kept that poor Billy out there for years, alone with &#8212;</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: More after the break. More Bob.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We certainly couldn&rsquo;t have done it without your help, Mr. Barker.</p>

<p>BARKER: Line number one, come on down.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. This is an amazing story, the largest airlift of lions ever, thanks to Bob Barker, of &ldquo;Price is Right&rdquo; fame; a second chance at life for 25 beautiful lions. They spent their entire lives in filthy cages as part of really deplorable Bolivian circuses and we&rsquo;re going to show you that video as we talk.</p>

<p>Bob Barker, the Bolivians aren&rsquo;t really the bad guys here because they&rsquo;re actually way ahead of us. They&rsquo;ve actually passed a law that the United States needs to pass. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, the ADI people went undercover and they collected such horrendous tape on the treatment of animals in Bolivia that the government actually passed this legislation that banned circuses that used any animals, even domestic animals. They are banned in Bolivia.</p>

<p>And after that legislation was passed, with other wildlife organizations, ADI went out and gathered up lions and other animals of all kinds and the lions, they brought to the United States, 25 beautiful lions.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Jorja why don&rsquo;t we do this in the United States? We just showed you video of Billy, the elephant at the L.A. Zoo. We could put him up again. You could tell he is in distress, he&rsquo;s rocking back and forth. There&rsquo;s been, I don&rsquo;t know how many legal battles over this elephant. They want to keep that elephant.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a sanctuary that&rsquo;s dying to take him. There he is. Look, when they rock back and forth like that, that shows that they are not happy, they are in distress, this poor guy on concrete.</p>

<p>Now, Bolivia is ahead of the United States. Why the heck, when we have the video here, this animal is not happy, we cannot get this animal freed to go to a sanctuary?</p>

<p>JORJA: Well, Jane, I want to say, you know Billy is an amazing example of just how horrible zoos can be for animals. He is not the exception, you know. Billy&rsquo;s story is a very, very common story. He happens to be one of the more famous elephants out there.</p>

<p>I think it is coming to the United States. I think that the more people find out what&rsquo;s going on and also examples, it is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish very quickly. And when you hear a success story like that and you see that it can actually be done, and you see these lions moving to a sanctuary, it brings it all into the realm of the possible.</p>

<p>I think in the United States, we are going to see a movement like this becoming more and more powerful over the next couple of years. It&rsquo;s a long time coming. And I believe in the goodness of people. This lion expedition was really for the lions and about the lions.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, it was a true testament to the human spirit and what people can accomplish when they work together to make something great happen; so many people stepped forward.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Absolutely. Yes. And I want to thank some of the organizations. You can help the lions as well by supporting the amazing groups that were involved and made this happen, check out Animal Defenders International, you can go to AD-International.org. You can also visit wildanimalsanctuary.org and make a donation and get involved.</p>

<p>Listen, Bob Barker, I am going to give you the last word. You are just a hero. What would you say to Americans about zoos?</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, I think that the progressive, well-informed zoos are already closing their elephant exhibits. I would like to see them close all of the big animal exhibits. I think that the sooner that there are &#8212;</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: We are out of time. I love both of you. Thank you.</p>
