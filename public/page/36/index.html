<h2 id="synopsis:e47d5a12905c5991090974b707c20598">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two girls run away from human traffickers, only to have one die at a rave in the middle of the desert when one of their abductors shoots at them. The CSIs notice the previous injury patterns, and begin looking for the other girl, however most of the witnesses were drugged out of their minds. Doc Robbins quickly verifies their fears, the deceased was involved in human trafficking and was likely a sex slave.</p>

<p>The second girl was rescued by Kitty, a med student at the rave, who tried to calm her down enough to turn in, but not before Morgan determined Kitty had more to hide. The trauma inflicted on the girl, who understands English, brings Morgan to tears: her tongue had been removed around six months prior. The girls escaped from their kidnappers after their transport (a cattle hauler) was in an accident with a car. Drivers of haulers were matched with registered owners of the gun used, to match up with Oliver Ruiz.</p>

<p>While the younger girl had no sexual trauma, she still refused to write down any information until after Morgan wrote her own down. Then she drew flowers and refused to explain. The DNA results came back to show they were sisters, which they track down to Jacinta and Rosa Flores, kidnapped a decade ago by their own mother. The father is found and brought to Las Vegas.</p>

<p>When Ruiz is found and brought in, they find another girl, hiding in his hauler. This girl does not have her tongue removed, and explains Ruiz is her cousin and brought her to America. She hadn&rsquo;t even known the other girls were in the truck, and explains that the car that hit the hauler had run them off the road as he was chasing the girls. The Flores sisters had snuck on Ruiz&rsquo;s trailer to escape their circumstances. The driver had stolen Ruiz&rsquo;s gun and run off after the Floreses.</p>

<p>Trace evidence left on Ruiz&rsquo;s shirt points to the father being the shooter. By the time they determine that, he had already removed Jacinta from the hospital. Still, they&rsquo;re able to track them down and arrest the father as he lights his trailer on fire with Jacinta still inside. Morgan rushes in to save her. Jacinta confirms that her mother was dead, and their father faked the kidnapping to abuse them, but Rosa tried to save her sister.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:e47d5a12905c5991090974b707c20598">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Working a sex crime case while celebrating her anniversary long distance does not a happy Sara make. She disagrees with Doc Robbins as if the dead girl is better off dead. He feels she is, because the girl would never be whole. Sara feels she should have had the chance to try.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox, best know for her roles on <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> along with <em>The West Wing</em> and <em>ER</em>, is also an avid environmentalist and conservationist. She is being honored this weekend with the Animal Champion Award for her work with Animal Defenders International. ADI has worked tirelessly to rescue and protect the abused and neglected animals across the globe.</p>

<p>The event this weekend, called the Lion Ark Night will focus on the rescue mission performed last year where ADI uncovered and put an end to cruelty to circus animals in Bolivia. They went undercover to rescue 29 lions and airlifted them from South America to Denver. *Price is Right *former host Bob Barker funded the entire thing and he, too, will be honored this weekend with ADI&rdquo;s Lifetime Achievement Award. The entire rescue is being made into a documentary called <em>Lion Ark</em> and clips will be shown at this weekend&rdquo;s Hollywood Hills gala.</p>

<p>In a recent exclusive interview, we spoke with Jorja about her work with ADI. We asked her about the event and she replied, &lsquo;It&rdquo;s going to be a heck of a partyâ¦ Bob Barker&rdquo;s going to be there. You can&rdquo;t beat that. I try never to miss a good party.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jorja talked about working with Bob, &lsquo;He&rdquo;s a legend. He&rdquo;s the nicest man. He&rdquo;s funny. He&rdquo;s got great style. Every time I see him I&rdquo;m wondering what he&rdquo;s going to be wearing. Maybe single handedly, more than anybody else that I know of, has been quietly contributing to causes that are very close to my heart and been contributing in extraordinary ways. Bob travels less than he used. He gets out in front of the public less than he used. And he&rdquo;s been making up for that behind the scenes. He has given incredibly generous gifts to several organizations over the last couple of years that have really allowed the organizations to stay afloat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>While she fully supports the award being bestowed on Barker this weekend, she is less than enthusiastic about her own honor. She stated, &lsquo;It feels really undeserved. I feel I have a lot more to do, a lot more to accomplish.</p>

<p>But it seems to us that like Jorja has done plenty. She remarked, &lsquo;Every time they call me, they call me for something extremely exciting.&rsquo; Aside form her involvement in the Lion Ark project, she has produced a documentary called <em>How I Became an Elephant</em>. It is the tale of a girl who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant working in the entertainment industry. Jorja cautioned that this is not an isolated problem, but a global one. She pointed out that many animals in captivity are forced to live on concrete, which can kill them. She said countless elephants die in zoos due to of infection in their feet because they weren&rdquo;t designed to stand on concrete. She noted, &lsquo;That&rdquo;s a crime. I think these animals deserve a lot better than that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jorja also went to Capital Hill with ADI last year to launch the &lsquo;Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act.&rsquo; And she encourages all animal lovers to call or write their congressperson to support the bill which will protect animals in entertainment who travel and from state to state. She stated that they need a federal law to protect them because they fall through the cracks since each state&rdquo;s laws vary.</p>

<p>She also emphasized the importance that the work of the ADI has not just for the animals but for humans as well. &lsquo;We can&rdquo;t exist without wildlife. We&rdquo;re just completely kidding ourselves if we think we can go it alone without all these animals. And so looking after these animals is important to me for the sake of these animals but also for the sake of &nbsp;people and the future of this planet. I don&rdquo;t want to live on Mars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of her goals is to eradicate certain animal institutions. &lsquo;If I had my way, circuses and zoos would be a thing of the past in the way that we know them now. I think there&rdquo;s a place for those institutions in the future. But I don&rdquo;t think they&rdquo;d look anything like what they look like right now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So we asked what they would look like in her version of the future. And while she acknowledged some habitats that already look like her dream there are many more that don&rdquo;t. &lsquo;I&rdquo;d like to see us moving under this umbrella term of &ldquo;sanctuary,&rdquo; so a tremendous amount of more space, no breeding programs. The public being able to see them would still happen but it would be more removed. People would be in a more respectful, quieter space.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And to Jorja the perfect circus is one without animals like Cirque du Soleil. She stated, &lsquo;We have so much to learn from these animals. We haven&rdquo;t even begun to figure out what we can learn from them. But I know it&rdquo;s not about watching an elephant put a basketball in a hoop. I think we can do better than that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tickets for Lion Ark Night 2012 on Saturday, October 13 are $150 and VIP tickets are $500 (which includes a VIP champagne reception). [&hellip;] Jorja&rdquo;s movie <em>How I Became an Elephant</em> is being screened in the Los Angeles area this weekend. [&hellip;] And if you&rdquo;re in the New York area this fall, Jorja is producing a one woman show about Dusty Springfield. [&hellip;]</p>

    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><div id="padbox">
		<p>Anyone who knows Jorja Fox&nbsp;understands just how special of a woman she is. The Sara Sidle actress is not only amazingly humble, talented, and yes, beautiful, but she&rdquo;s also incredibly&nbsp;brilliant, kind, and well spoken, which makes anyone in her presence feel special. After playing this one character for over twelve seasons, she knows the ins and outs of her character to a T, and is always eager to add new layers and nuances to her performance. Fortunately, for fans, this season will be a year of personal development for many of the characters on <em>CSI</em>, which will allow Fox to crank out some of those dramatic performances she&rdquo;s known for. Which is the case tonight with the new episode &lsquo;Code Blue Plate Special,&rsquo; an installment that really hits close to home for Sara. Shane Saunders&nbsp;caught up with the actress earlier this week to discuss character growth, upcoming episodes, and yes, the state of GSR. Spoilers after the jump.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: As I watched &lsquo;Karma to Burn&rsquo; I really thought back to the beginning of the series, and really up until a few seasons ago, how Sara was at times moody, insubordinate, and slightly immature, but now she&rdquo;s this completely new woman who, to me, seems to have taken over, in a professional sense, the &ldquo;Mother Hen&rdquo; role from Catherine. There&rdquo;s been this huge journey and evolution of the character, that, at least in my mind, seems to have taken this huge shift after she returned in Season Ten, announcing that she married Grissom. Would you say that&rdquo;s one of the reasons as well?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong>: [Laughs.] <em>Oooooh</em>. Marriage? Well, yeah, I think she&rdquo;s aged, obviously, like everyone has and hopefully people get a little more mature as they age. I think that she needed to leave not just Vegas, but she had to leave that whole profession behind to just kind of really find her center and her balance. I think as a kid, having the experience she had with her mom and growing up in foster care, I think she had a drive that brought her to the field that she was in in kind of a blind, personal and passionate way. When she quit it and just left, started traveling around the world&ndash;and eventually Grissom [<strong>William Petersen</strong>] joined her&ndash;I think she found the love for what she was doing from a whole different place. She buried some ghosts and buried some demons, and was able to come back at it. And, yes, absolutely I think being in a secure and loving relationship with Grissom&ndash;I hope very much it&rdquo;s helped her stability in that way. Although, I think, reading&nbsp;in between&nbsp;the lines, it&rdquo;s really been awhile since we&rdquo;ve seen Grissom so I&rdquo;ve gotta imagine there&rdquo;s got to be a little bit of tension there. But I wouldn&rdquo;t know what it is yet because I&rdquo;m not one of the writers.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: I would imagine after playing this character for over a decade, portraying her in this new light gives you as an actress some fun things to do.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: Oh, yeah, and I think we&rdquo;ve talked about this before, but to come into Season Thirteen&ndash;really forget about of the same show, but of the same character&ndash;is something I thought I&rdquo;d never experience in my life. If someone had asked me about it when I was younger, I could never have even conceived playing a character that long; it probably would have scared me and might have been something I wouldn&rdquo;t think would be fun. But I can&rdquo;t believe after thirteen seasons, like, I&rdquo;m not bored at all; I&rdquo;m still like, &ldquo;Wow, what&rdquo;s going to happen this year? Who are the people that Sara&rdquo;s going to meet this year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rdquo;s really exciting to have three new cast members kind of in one season. I could have thought that would be sort of disruptive and might shake the cast up in a way that&ndash;because we&rdquo;ve always been <em>so</em> close and a really tight that cast that has always gotten along so well&ndash;to sort of three wild cards in there you&rdquo;d think, &ldquo;Wowâ¦ this can&rdquo;t go well. It&rdquo;s just a question of how badly this is going to go.&rdquo; And it&rdquo;s been fantastic; I can&rdquo;t even believe that we&rdquo;ve been able to ride that wave and it&rdquo;s just been so fun to have these people to work with, people that are amazingly cool and just incredibly kind and generous as actors and human beings. Of course I still miss <strong>Marg</strong> [<strong>Helgenberger</strong>, Catherine Willows], Billy and <strong>Gary</strong> [<strong>Dourdan</strong>, Warrick Brown] all the time.</p>

<p>We just finished Episode Seven and we meet Warrick&rdquo;s son, who we haven&rdquo;t seen since the funeral [in &ldquo;For Warrick&rdquo;], and his ex-wife. It was a really difficult and devastating episode to shoot. I know I miss him and I really wish we would have never killed him off&ndash;I feel like I really disagreed with The Powers That Be with that call. It was really hard to go back and shoot, but I really think it&rdquo;s going to be a beautiful show.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: One of the big takeaways for me from last season was the dynamic of DB and Sara. Those two really hit it off, and I think they can relate in a way that, for example, they both have so much going on in their lives and have to work this grueling and taxing job, and put it all on the back-burner. And from what I read most fans feel that way, as well. What have you enjoyed most about working with <strong>Ted Danson</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: He&rdquo;s really amazing; I&rdquo;m not sure he&rdquo;s human. People know him for ten minutes, but he&rdquo;s the kind of guy that can show up and create chemistry with someone. You could look into his eyes in a scene and feel like you&rdquo;ve known each other ten years. Most people that work with him probably feel that way. [Laughs.] He has that amazing talent to make everyone feel special and on top of that he&rdquo;s just an incredible leader. No matter how long a day yet, he&rdquo;s still got his energy and his optimism. He&rdquo;s incredibly funny and it&rdquo;s really nice to stay around at work&ndash;some of the days can be pretty gruesome and horrible&ndash;and just kind of laugh. I&rdquo;m glad they&rdquo;ve been able to put a little bit of that into the show; I think the show will never be a comedy, but we&rdquo;ve been able to do more funny stuff in this last season than probably in all the years of the show combined.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: From what I can gather, you&rdquo;ll be doing a reduced number of episodes this season. Are we looking at doing more or less episodes than last season?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: That is not always totally in form; it doesn&rdquo;t really take shape until we get through the season. I know that I&rdquo;ll do a minimum of fifteen, so probably somewhere between fifteen and seventeen. We sort of take a couple months at a time.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: You took a break seasons eight and nine. Is your plan as of now to see the show to the end?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: [Laughs.] I can&rdquo;t answer that, Shane! Only because we always think, &ldquo;<em>Aaah</em>, it&rdquo;s probably only one more season. Maybe two more seasons.&rdquo; I sort of think we got to be coming close to the end, but who knows, right? Hopefully we can go another ten years. Yes, right now, theoretically, I think I&rdquo;d like to see it to the end; that would be a really cool thing to accomplish. My goal as of now is to do twenty seasons in a row on primetime network television and this, for me, I&rdquo;m starting season seventeen.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Oh wow.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: Yeah. Some of those seasons I may have done only four or five shows, but I was in there; I snuck my face in there. [Laughs.]</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: &lsquo;Code Blue Plate Special,&rsquo; is a rather significant installment for Sara. How personal of a case is this to her?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: Pretty personal. I think it&rdquo;s going to be a really great episode; I haven&rdquo;t seen it. [Laughs.] I totally expected it to be on last Wednesday&ndash;I was like, &lsquo;Where are all the shows?&rsquo; I enjoyed watching the debates but didn&rdquo;t realize how much they would preempt everything. Not only does Sara know the victim, but she believes she knows the suspect. It&rdquo;s pretty personal, I think. It&rdquo;s certainly something that Sara is incredibly passionate about. You&rdquo;re going to see Sara get very angry.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: We&rdquo;ve seen her look into cases of those she&rdquo;s known in the past; how emotionally invested is she in this case, as to say from &lsquo;One Hit Wonder,&rsquo; when her friend Melissa Winters goes from victim to suspect?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: [Laughs.] Oh, wow. That&rdquo;sâ¦ thank you for mentioning that episode. [Laughs.] This is a person that Sara sees several times a week in her life. She knows the intricacies of this woman&rdquo;s life and the suspect? She hates this guy. She hates him. He&rdquo;s a really talented guy and he&rdquo;s that guy I think where everyone wants to see him go down. I don&rdquo;t know that Wednesday night&rdquo;s episode is going to get 100% resolved.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Episode Eight is in production right now. What else is going on for Sara in the first run of episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: I have a really intense arc on Episode Seven which is the episode we bring Warrick&rdquo;s son in. I think that episode, particularly for Nick [<strong>George Eads</strong>] and Sara, is pretty devastating and heart-wrenching. Almost every character so far this season&ndash;at least the six forensic investigators&ndash;have had a chance to really delve very deeply into a case or situation. <strong>Eric</strong>&ldquo;s [<strong>Szmanda</strong>, Greg Sanders] character has an episode that deals a lot with old Vegas and Vegas in the forties. <strong>Elisabeth Harnois</strong> [Morgan Brody] has a case that deals with human trafficking that we really follow her for most of the episode. <strong>Elisabeth Shue</strong> [Julie Finlay] in &lsquo;CSI On Fire&rsquo; is about to do that; that&rdquo;s a cold case of hers that will also bring in her ex-husband. I think we&rdquo;ve all been there supporting each other for a lot of these episodes, but there&rdquo;s definitely one that is driving each episode. Russell&rdquo;s son [<strong>Brandon W. Jones</strong>] is accused of murder. There&rdquo;s been a real theme of personal intimacy this season. I don&rdquo;t know&ndash;you tell me if you like them and if the fans like them.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Ted&rdquo;s son on the show, Brandon, is a really good friend of mine and he was pretty excited about having a pretty big episode to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: He was amazing; he did a great job. He&rdquo;s been a great addition to the cast. Of course he&rdquo;s not there every week, but he&rdquo;s got such a great sense of energy and great spirit. It&rdquo;s great to get to know him a little bit.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: There&rdquo;s always the rumor mill circulating at the beginning of a season when producers mention in interviews that they&rdquo;d like to see Billy return, and that they enjoy the two of you having a creative input in the story-telling of GSR. Have you had any meetings thus far? I know Billy stepped away from <em>Hurt People</em>, so is it looking more likely for him to make a cameo this year?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: I didn&rdquo;t know he stepped away from <em>Hurt People</em>. He did?</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: About a month or so ago.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: I miss some of these important moments. Well, certainly if he steps away from <strong>Hurt People</strong> then yes, I&rdquo;d say there is a good chance than there might have been a month ago. I think a month or two ago it appeared like he might have been a bit too busy for us, so that&rdquo;s exciting. I wish I had more to say about that, but it&rdquo;s definitely promising now.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Over the summer you launched an official Facebook page, but haven&rdquo;t really used it all too much so far. Are you sticking with Facebook for the most part, or are you thinking about attempting Twitter as well?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: Oh my gosh, well thank you for even seeing my Facebook. You see how neglected it is then you know that my obvious answer is I definitely can&rdquo;t add another social media forum to my list. If I can&rdquo;t even update&ndash;I thought to myself, &lsquo;All you have to do is post twice a week! It&rdquo;s fun and creative and whatever it&rdquo;s going to beâ¦&rsquo; and weeks go by where I can&rdquo;t even post anything. I&rdquo;m an embarrassment to the online social media community, so yeah, no Twitter. [Laughs.] I still haven&rdquo;t given up on Facebook. I apologize, and thank you for even caring.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: This weekend you&rdquo;re receiving two awards: one from ADI and another for your film, <em>How I Became An Elephant</em>. How does it feel to be recognized for your ongoing support of animal rights?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: It feels amazing, but I don&rdquo;t really feel like I earned it yet. I don&rdquo;t know that I&rdquo;ve really put the time and the energy into getting awards of any kind, but obviously to be recognized is an amazing feeling. I&rdquo;m going to have a very busy weekend and I&rdquo;m really excited to celebrate those parts of my life.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: One last question just for fun. Your schedule is incredibly busy, but what shows are you watching during your downtime?</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong>: I love <em>Modern Family</em>. I usually wait a couple weeks to watch them on my Tivo or try to watch a couple in a row. I&rdquo;ve been watching <em>Homeland</em>; I love <em>Homeland</em>. [<strong>David</strong>] <strong>Rambo</strong>&ldquo;s new show, <em>Revolution</em>, I&rdquo;m watching. I love some of the NatGeo sort of reality programming&ndash;<em>Locked Up Abroad</em>. And I&rdquo;m excited about the premiere of <em>American Horror Story</em>.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The staff and patrons of Frank&rsquo;s Diner are found dead, not long after the stalker of the waitress, Edie, is scared off by the cops. The only survivor is the owner&rsquo;s brother (Vincent), who locked himself in the walk in freezer. <strong>Sara</strong>, Nick and Greg happen upon the scene, coming by for a meal.</p>

<p>The cops who had seen the stalker, Ronald Basderic, admit they did nothing, since he was gone by the time he went outside. Of the dead, only two weren&rsquo;t regulars or employees. Finn finds something odd in the blood trails, in that three bodies were clearly moved and staged after being shot.</p>

<p>Basderic shows up in the morgue, asking for Edie, and Doc Robbins has David call Sara for the paperwork. Sara bursts in with a gun and an armed officer, matching a footprint on the scene of the crime to Basderic&rsquo;s shoe. Basderic claims he had left when the cops looked at him, walked around the block, and when he came back, everyone was dead. He went in to check on Edie, but as she was dead, left.</p>

<p>One of the victims, Alex Brenner, was in WitSec, and had agreed to testify against some &lsquo;very bad people.&rsquo; The US Marshals feel that the men might have killed seven innocents to get to Brenner. Brenner was sitting with a man named Robert Rios, who was not a victim per se, as his stomach contents were nothing that Frank&rsquo;s Diner serves, and he had evidence of having worn both a gun and a ski mask.</p>

<p>The guns are found, stashed in the newspaper machine, with Basderic&rsquo;s prints on the paper. The prints are coincidence, however. The real killer is Vincent, who shot his brother because Owen wouldn&rsquo;t agree to franchise the diner. He had hired Rios to do a fake robbery, killing only Owen, but when Owen pulled the mask off and shot everyone, Vincent had to move the bodies and finish off Edie.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Ronald Basderic was terrorizing Edie Graham, the waitress, for six months. Sara tried to help her get a restraining order.</p>

<p>Sara chases the rabbit trail of Basderic, assuming he had to have stalked someone before. Greg helps her out and finds that Basderic, who claims to hate guns, had shot a man in &lsquo;self defense&rsquo; and was awarded $200k by the judge for it. Sara hates him for it, and for stalking Edie.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still reacts strongly to women in abusive situations.<br /></li>
<li>Sara chases rabbits, spending time hunting down Basderic, even though he&rsquo;s not the killer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:73bdd55927441f8674339729eefb0199">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> You&rsquo;re done, you son of a bitch.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Basderic</strong> You see. You were wrong. I didn&rsquo;t hurt her. I couldn&rsquo;t. I loved her.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You loved her? Are you kidding me? You terrorized her. You kept her awake at night. You made her afraid to walk down the street. And you want to know what else your twisted love did? It killed her, Ronald. Edie was supposed to be off work at 4:00. She should have been gone when the shooting happened, it she was afraid to walk home because she was afraid that you were out there. It&rsquo;s because of you that she stayed, and now she&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files:</strong> It brought back memories from Season Four, when Sara started popping cough drops to mask her issues with alcohol and ultimately facing a DUI. If anyone is going to stop [Nick] from loosing focus, it&rdquo;s her; and she did. Will they talk about this issue in subsequent episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: Yes. There was purpose to the fact that they&rdquo;re in different places in their lives and yet it was very poignant for Sara and Nick to get into it. She does want to help him&ndash;there&rdquo;s the emotionalÂ push-backÂ of him quitting at the worst possible time; there&rdquo;s never a good timeÂ *to*Â do these things, there&rdquo;s always emotions so it&rdquo;s messy. They can help each other, but like Nick said he&rdquo;s not in a position to be lectured to, but that isn&rdquo;t what she was trying to do. There was a little bit of miscommunication and they will try to help each other out. Sara has gained perspective so she understands where Nick is coming from and Nick is not at a point where he can easily hear that at this moment, at least in the premiere.</p>

<p><strong>CSI Files</strong>: Moving forward in the season, how will the dynamic of Nick, Sara and Greg Â shift? Is this a season of conflict for the three of them?</p>

<p><strong>Barbour</strong>: I think it&rdquo;s probably more a season of maturity for Greg. An episode coming up will focus in on him and his further maturing at CSI and his personal life. I don&rdquo;t think there&rdquo;ll be conflict with them, but certainly things are changing in their lives. Things can never stay the same; you get comfortable with a certain situation, and you expect certain things and sometimes things change for good and sometimes they change for bad. I don&rdquo;t know that they&rdquo;re going to fight more, but certainly they are going to have to readjust their own expectations of what the job presents to them and how they can help each other.</p>
