		<p>The 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival started off with a buzz of energy on Thursday, Oct. 10.</p>

<p>A cheery crowd of filmmakers, actors, producers and staunch film fans mixed over stylish small bites, wine and cocktails at an opening night party at the Halekulani in Waikiki, as organizers flitted about and dignitaries, including Mayor Kirk Caldwell, greeted the fest.</p>

<p>The evening was especially fantastic for me, as I was able to sit down for an animated and uplifting talk with Jorja Fox, who plays Sara on &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; one of contemporary televisions most popular and long-running series. The actor, who also appeared on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and in a story arc on &ldquo;The West Wing,&rdquo; seems to have a knack for connecting with popular television dramas.</p>

<p>Fox was in Hawaii to promote the documentary &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; along with producers/filmmakers/activists Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, founders of Animal Defenders International.</p>

<p>The film depicts the rescue of 25 African lions from Bolivian circuses, in the wake of a 2010 law prohibiting the use of animals in traveling shows. Phillips and Creamer, whove made their first full-length film with &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; were right there every step of the way.</p>

<p>The subject matter is dramatic and gripping  the quest brought the filmmakers into remote parts of Bolivia, and often circuses were not cooperative. In the films opening scenes, a circus operator, waving a knife, slashes their tires to try to prevent a rescue.</p>

<p>It also has a happy ending, as Fox and the filmmakers take pains to point out: All of the lions at risk were airlifted out of Bolivia, finding a home at a sprawling sanctuary in Colorado, where a giant (80-acre) protective enclosure was custom-built for the lions to help them adjust to the colder climate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to think of it as an action-adventure-dramedy,&rdquo; Fox said, partially joking. &ldquo;There are some funny moments in it, but there is epic drama. To get to be a part of it was fantastic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox was there as the lions were being taken to shelter in Colorado, as is seen in the film.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be surrounded by 25 roaring lions  that real, raw power was an experience Ill never forget,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Creamer can speak passionately about the mistreatment imposed on animals in traveling circuses, while Phillips emphasizes their work is based on strictly factual findings  often uncovered by working surreptitiously to gather evidence on the scene, as the filmmakers did for years in Bolivia.</p>

<p>FOX HAS worked with Phillips and Creamer for more than seven years, beginning with a collaboration on the short documentary film, &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant.&rdquo; Fox served as producer for that film, which exposes the treatment of elephants as &ldquo;performers&rdquo; in traveling shows and in movies.</p>

<p>Fox was involved with &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; from the beginning, consulting with the filmmakers on the eye-witness approach and stepping in front of the camera during scenes films when the lions arrive in Colorado.</p>

<p>Shes also supporting the film by appearing at HIFF. Shell be at Dole Cannery on Saturday, Oct. 12, for the screening of &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ive been passionate about the environment, marine protection and wildlife, all my life,&rdquo; Fox said, explaining why she got involved. Born in New York City, she lived in Melbourne, Florida with her family as a child. Now based in L.A., shes a surfer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very familiar with Hawaii, but I wasnt that familiar with the festival until Jan and Tim got invited to come,&rdquo; Fox confided.</p>

<p>As she spoke, a stylish woman with close-cropped hair leaned over our table to say, &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt, but we love your show. I just had to come over and tell you that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>THE SHOW, of course, is &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; which is about to reach a huge milestone: the airing of its 300th episode.</p>

<p>The episode has already been filmed, Fox said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its going to be amazing, thats all I can say,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We didnt really think it was that big a deal until we started shooting it, and then we started realizing that its pretty rare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the new shows especially, so many of them are doing 13 episodes a season instead of 24  its going to take them 26 years to get to 300 episodes! I dont know that that many new shows are going to get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We tried to enjoy every minute&rdquo; of filming, she said. Special care was taken in writing the scenes, and some pieces of the episode pay tribute to the series long history, including &ldquo;faux-back&rdquo; segments that recreate characters storylines reaching back to the shows first year. Original cast member Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows) is also back for the 300th show.</p>

<p>I asked Fox how long the wild ride that has been &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; can last, and she responded that its up to viewers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope my favorite episode is yet to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Its lasted far longer than I ever anticipated.  Now, I think Ill do it as long as the fans want us to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cant even imagine leaving at this point. It would seem foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IN THE MEANTIME, Fox is hoping for big audiences and international impact with &ldquo;Lion Ark.&rdquo; The film was just awarded the Audience Award at the San Diego Film Festival, where it sold out its screening. Screenings also sold out at Londons Raindance Film Festival, an offshoot of Robert Redfords Sundance Film Festival in Colorado.</p>

<p>Asked what she learned from working on &ldquo;Lion Ark,&rdquo; Fox said, &ldquo;Anything is possible. If you put your heart and soul to it, you can move mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hawaiian Humane Society has teamed up with Animal Defenders International to promote &ldquo;Lion Ark&rdquo; at HIFF. For more on efforts to improve conditions for captive or domesticated animals here in Hawaii, go to hawaiianhumane.org.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:dd5696e6c5ee380578fb098ddc6fb290">Synopsis##</h2>

<p>When a fire breaks out at a Las Vegas nightclub, it&rsquo;s every man for himself, resulting in multiple deaths not from the fire itself but from the escaping mob and smoke inhalation. Among the dead include two band members (front man and bass player), a white 18-year old Kevin, and a young Latino man named Timo Pedia. The kicker? The band is a white supremacist hate core band: White Rising.</p>

<p>Timo was killed in the storeroom at the club before being dumped in the dance floor.</p>

<p>The fire was set intentionally, initially thought to be via a cardboard box doused in gasoline with a candle as a timer. Hodges traces the cardboard back to Lee Wong Automotive, which surprises Nick, as Brass recently worked a case where Lee Wong Jr. was beaten into a coma when &lsquo;White Rising&rsquo; played at the club before. Nora Wong explains that she and her friends had made Sky Lanterns for Lee, and the evidence is from months ago.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the fire was so bad was that a car was blocking the door. This car was used by Caleb Voight (borrowed from a minion in his skinhead community) after he killed Timo. While Caleb didn&rsquo;t start the fire, he saw who did, and describes the shirt worn by the John Doe who survived the fire, but is now on life support: Ian Baxton, a serial arsonist for hire.</p>

<p>Baxton had been hired by the club owner, who hasn&rsquo;t able to keep the club afloat.</p>

<h2 id="introduction:d8a5738ef7f3b53ed23480f0c7f01a6f">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Please, before we start anything, give a big hand to Pacific Sun, who is responsible for letting <em>Lion Ark</em> be here today.  The film is co-presented by Animal Defenders International, which had, obviously you&rsquo;ll see, an integral part in the creation of <em>Lion Ark</em>. We&rsquo;re very happy to have this film, it&rsquo;s a powerful film, it&rsquo;s an exciting film. It&rsquo;s going to subvert a lot of your expectations about both seeing a documentary and about some of the assumptions we had growing up or seeing in our culture. I think it&rsquo;s going to be a really successful event today. Please give a warm welcome to an ambassador for Animal Defenders International, and also the associate producer, Jorja Fox.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone, <em>[Light laughter]</em> and welcome to the North American premiere of <em>Lion Ark</em>.  Very exciting day for us. On behalf of the filmmakers, Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, we want to humbly thank the Mill Valley Film Festival for having us at this incredible event. And we also want to thank you very much for coming out to see the movie.</p>

<p>Being a part of <em>Lion Ark</em> has been an epic adventure for me, and today is no exception. I&rsquo;m thrilled to get to watch all of you watch the movie. It&rsquo;s very fitting for <em>Lion Ark</em> that we&rsquo;re premiering here, as it&rsquo;s the first place the first group of lions landed from Bolivia, back in the spring of 2010. Those four lions are living in the PAWS Sanctuary, near [Gulf(?)], California. Moving lions on airplanes is kind of a strange and rare thing. And the city of San Francisco, San Francisco International Airport and the surrounding areas were so very kind to us and welcomed us with a very serene calm and gracious resolve. We&rsquo;re very grateful for that.  <em>Lion Ark</em>&#8216;s biggest stars, the main stars of the movie, lions, of course couldn&rsquo;t be here today. They&rsquo;re tired from their life in show business. But many of the key human players are here. They&rsquo;ve traveled far and wide, from the United Kingdom to South America.</p>

<p>We are having a Q&amp;A immediately after the film, and I very much hope you&rsquo;ll stick around for questions and comments, and to hear from this amazing and diverse group of people who are all experts in their fields. We&rsquo;re also having a party tonight, a bit of a fundraiser for the next chapter of <em>Lion Ark</em>. We cordially invite all of you to come. It&rsquo;s going to be at Bungalow 44 at six o&rsquo;clock. You can see anyone in the black <em>Lion Ark</em> t-shirts with clipboards for tickets, and tickets will also be available at the door if we don&rsquo;t sell out. Tickets are $70. As I mentioned, it&rsquo;s a fundraiser. You&rsquo;ll get drinks and appetizers, and a chance to mingle with the filmmakers and the rescue team. We hope to see all of you there.</p>

<p>Lastly, and I&rsquo;ll be brief, I just want to talk about the film makers. Jane Creamer and Tim Phillips for a minute. Jan and Tim have been working absolutely tirelessly for over thirty years for the betterment of wild and domesticated animals alike, across the globe. They run an organization called Animal Defenders International. This wonderful film that you&rsquo;re about to see highlights just one of their campaigns. Needless to say, they lead very exciting lives. From bustling cities to the most barren and remote landscapes, Jan and Tim have a knack for making friends and allies wherever they go. They&rsquo;re bridge builders, of a sort. Metaphoric bridge building is a very rare skill, a very special skill. I think it&rsquo;s a skill that&rsquo;s sorely lacking in most fields in the landscape today. And I think that it is the Golden Key to finding solutions for our planets&rsquo; issues.</p>

<p>Animal Defenders International works from private support. They depend on private support for the work that they do. If you feel inspired by this film, and I think you will, please offer up your own support, be it a donation, spreading the world, or volunteering, or all of the above. It&rsquo;s ADI&rsquo;s greatest hope &#8212; sorry, forgot to change my page <em>[Jorja laughs at herself]</em> &#8212; It&rsquo;s ADI&rsquo;s greatest hope to give as many animals as possible, out in the world, a happy ending.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, <em>Lion Ark</em>. Thank you.</p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<h2 id="q-a:d8a5738ef7f3b53ed23480f0c7f01a6f">Q&amp;A</h2>

<p>[Asked how they got involved]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I think I was lucky I grew up in a very small town in Florida. My grandmother was very influential in my life. She was a rabid environmentalist, and kind of a modern thinker on a lot of levels, and I took after her quite a bit. I think I also &#8212; it was also the &lsquo;80s, and it was music videos and it was new media and there were a couple kids in my school, eccentric kids in my school, who were vegetarians and would talk about that stuff. It kind of opened a door for me to learn as much as I could. I had a lot to do with books at that time too. I think it&rsquo;s amazing, in the few short years since the &lsquo;80s, how far some of these ideas have come. I really do think we&rsquo;re reaching a tipping point with animals and entertainment and circuses and zoos. There&rsquo;s better options. There&rsquo;s PAWS and the Wild Animal Sanctuary and I think we&rsquo;re starting to get those ideas, and I think we&rsquo;re going to see some really positive changes over the next ten, fifteen, years. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be thinking that&rsquo;s really a thing of the past, it&rsquo;s really not that cool to see an animal in a cage do a trick, like roll a ball or whatever. There&rsquo;s far cool things they can do.</p>

<p>[How do they get all these animals in circuses?]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You (Jan Creamer) kind of just said what I was going to say. Most of it, especially in the United States, all comes from breeding programs. The animals are here. It&rsquo;s actually very difficult now to get them across International borders. People do it, sometimes for the right reasons, and sometimes not. I think there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of animals up at PAWS that started out in somebody&rsquo;s basement. They bought it on a black market, it was a pet for a time, and then it got too big, too strong, and they had to figure out what to do with it.</p>

<p>&#8212;-</p>

<p><strong>Post Screening</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> You know, I love the film so much. And I&rsquo;ve really only seen it finished twice, so today was my second time. I was moved a little more than I wanted to be, &lsquo;cause I was in this public theater with a lot of people. I wanted to be so very cool and calm and collected. It was a thrill and a half. It was amazing. We&rsquo;re so happy to be here at the Mill Valley Festival. We want to thank everybody or having us.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, I think so. Not too many people left early, so that&rsquo;s always a really good sign. I do, I kind of see the film as an action/adventure piece. It is a documentary, and it&rsquo;s real events, but to me there&rsquo;s a lot of hair-raising, edge-of-your-seats moments, and yes, I think the audience very much stayed with us for the film.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Why did I have to make it? I think I was lucky to get to be a part of the film. The events, moving the lions from Bolivia to the United States a couple years ago, I got to be a part of that move, and at the time I remember somebody saying &ldquo;Oh yeah, we&rsquo;re documenting this.&rdquo; and we all had mics on. I was just really thrilled to get to be a part of it. It was, I think, an epic accomplishment to move 28 lions 48,000 miles to a sanctuary. I really wasn&rsquo;t sure that it could be done, that it could be pulled off. Certainly there would be some hitch somewhere along the way. You know, it&rsquo;s funny. For a movie that&rsquo;s so exciting, so much of the work that went into the actual move was so slow, and meticulous and methodical, including securing these laws on traveling circuses throughout the world. It&rsquo;s very tedious work. It was a miracle that it all came together.</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <em>[unintelligible question]</em></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It&rsquo;s Northern California, I love this part of the country, I come here often. I think that Mill Valley is a very peaceful place, it&rsquo;s a place that&rsquo;s very connected with the nature surrounding it. There&rsquo;s water everywhere, it&rsquo;s in the foothills and the redwoods. There&rsquo;s amazing surfing and sailing. So particularly, not only for this film, <em>Lion Ark</em>, I think it&rsquo;s a perfect match in terms of content in a place, but also for me as a person who&rsquo;s a surfer and an outdoor person, it&rsquo;s always good to be up here. I love the food here. I love the wine, I love the coffee. It&rsquo;s a really great place to visit, and I&rsquo;m sure a great place to live.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:d52634a4601a7da0be88b230ffb7694e">Synopsis##</h2>

<p>A high stakes game of Texas No-Limit Hold&rsquo;em at the Four Kings Casino ends with a heist, when a motorcyclist, Clint Tyree, steals over a million in cash and kills the guard, Paul Branston. He doesn&rsquo;t make out alive, however, as a security guard shoots at him causing him to crash on Fremont street. The shots don&rsquo;t kill him, or even hit him, but the thief collapses anyway, dead. When the CSIs arrive, they learn the money and chips are fake, and the thief&rsquo;s face is grotesquely swollen.</p>

<p>Clint, a stunt rider for the Four Kings, died of an allergic reaction, however it was caused by an injection that punctured him through his motorcycle leathers. Back at the casino, none of the witnesses are sure what happened, being confused from the power outage and flash-bang grenades. The CSIs suspect Robert Gentry, the loser in the poker game, who bumped into Clint during the heist, and subsequently vanished before the cops arrived. While looking for Genty, they question Ryan Archer as to how the lights were turned off, and he reveals there&rsquo;s an app for that, but the user would need a code.</p>

<p>Gentry is found at another casino, betting with the chips stolen from the Four Kings. He cops to stealing the chips, but claims innocence to the major theft and murder. Also he claims to have seen Clint running the <em>opposite</em> way from where he was killed. This gives the CSIs a lead, and they realize Clint was part of a pair, and played the decoy. Someone else has the money, and probably is the same person who poisoned Clint with snake venom.</p>

<p>Julian Reese, a valet parker for the Four Kings, happens to have a license for the venomous Russell snake. Of course, Julian skipped work, but he&rsquo;s quickly found &hellip; shot in the head in his car, with his snake in the back seat. A set of motorcycle leathers, and the syringe used to kill Clint, are found in the trunk of Julian&rsquo;s car, and trace of mechanic&rsquo;s soap on his shirt. The same soap used by the Ryan Archer. And it was Chad&rsquo;s code that turned the lights off.</p>

<p>When he&rsquo;s hauled in, Ryan looses it, shouting that he can&rsquo;t be there, but he won&rsquo;t tell them why. At his house, the CSIs learn his wife died recently of cancer, but also that his 10 month old son was kidnapped by the people behind the heist. Ryan divulges that Julian approached him about a plan, but Ryan declined, only to have his son kidnapped.</p>

<p>Evidence at Ryan&rsquo;s house points the CSIs back to Paul Branston, the guard, who had served four turns in Afghanistan and been discharged with for bad conduct after trying to smuggle out artifacts. Paul also wasn&rsquo;t due to work that day in that room, he traded for the shift. Evidence also shows that Paul kidnapped Ryan&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>As the CSI&rsquo;s interrogate Paul&rsquo;s wife, Ryan manages to ditch his cop bodyguard and makes a break to the employee parking lot, where the kidnappers ask to meet him. The CSIs are close behind, but too late. Ryan, scared out of his mind, accidentally shoots the dealer from the poker game. Audrey was also in on the crime, and had Ryan&rsquo;s son in her car. It was also her gun used to kill Julian in his car the day before.</p>

<p>Trace on the baby&rsquo;s clothes comes back positive for Rifampin, a drug used to treat meningitis, and also one that Ryan was taking. Ryan was the mastermind, killing the other four in order to get the money to take care of his son.</p>

<p>Sara arrives on the scene with Nick and David Phillips, just as surprised as they are to learn about the fake loot and the thief&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>She and Morgan Brody go to the maintenance room to meet with Ryan, and learn about the app for the lights, as well as the soap Ryan uses. This is beneficial later when David Hodges and Henry both try to one-up each other, explaining the trace found on Julian&rsquo;s shirt. It&rsquo;s Sara who puts it together as mechanic&rsquo;s soap, and she and Jim Brass interrogate Ryan.</p>

<p>Later, Sara and Finn go over Paul&rsquo;s history, learning about his less than honorable service, when Hodges brings them news about the baby-trace in Paul&rsquo;s car.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Is there any chance of Grissom popping up in <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s 300th episode? &ldquo;Selena&rdquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;ADAM:&ldquo;&rsquo; In the flesh? Nah. But the episode, which flashes back to a 14-year-old case, does feature a full-circle shout-out to the man who started it all. &ldquo;[The writers] pay a very sound and beautiful homage to [Grissom],&rdquo; Jorja Fox says. Speaking of Grissom, how is Sara handling the couple&rsquo;s separation this season? &ldquo;Sara is too young to sleep alone,&rdquo; Fox says. &ldquo;As painful as it is to not be with Grissom anymore, the idea of also being with the ghost of Grissom is really lonely and alienating.&rdquo; Does that mean she&rsquo;ll be sharing her bed with someone else? Not exactly. &ldquo;Sara is always going to be in love with Grissom. She&rsquo;s always going to pine for him and her heart is always, in a certain way, going to belong to him,&rdquo; Fox says.</p>
