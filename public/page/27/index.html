<h2 id="synopsis:79793bd525b2f827ec3386200d56e6e6">Synopsis</h2>

<p>David Hodges fiancee, Elisabetta, is at a spiritual seminar/retreat run by Alan Quinn, sans Hodges. While she&rsquo;s in the all natural mud springs with another man, Santo, the dead body floats to the surface.</p>

<p>Justin Wade had attended as part of a corporate retreat, but wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the New Agey aspects, and skipped out on the firewalk, upsetting his teammates. After spending some time in the mud springs (and spurning the advances of a coworker), Justin went back to the firewalk and attempted it and somehow fell into the coals, killing himself in the process. Alan claims not to have known that Justin was the dead man, and admitted that Justin did ask to try the firewalk afterwards, but Alan turned him down because he wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>

<p>The autopsy reveals Justin had an allergic reaction, causing him to go into anaphylactic shock. As he was allergic to latex, and inhaled it at the firewalk, Greg goes back to sort through the coal and ash, where he finds latex hormone pellets made by Bixton, the pharmaceutical company Justin worked for. Meanwhile, Sara interviews the wife, telling her that signs pointed to Justin having an affair with a coworker, Jessica Lowell. The wife admits she suspected as much, but decided not to confront them about it: she trusted her husband.</p>

<p>Jessica was suspected of stealing company secrets, but in truth she worked in security, teamed with the FBI. Justin and fellow teammate Heather Connor were making meth. Meth which caused Heather to OD while being interviewed by Finn. Goat milk was found in Heather&rsquo;s stomach, and goat hair on her skin, as well as in some street drugs, so the CSIs follow the leads to a drug lab in the middle of nowhere. Curiously, the trashed lab is far too high tech for <em>just</em> meth, including goat&rsquo;s milk enzymes and membrane patches. Hiding in the lab is Justin&rsquo;s wife, Mary.</p>

<p>Mary has a rare blood disorder, and Justin joined Bixton to steal the formula for her and brew it on his own (goat&rsquo;s milk being an ingredient). Since that was expensive, he and Heather made meth to pay for it all. But Mary did not destroy the lab, she found it that way when she went to pick up her meds. Blood found on the scene points to Alan Quinn as the break-in. Alan was in love with Mary, and killed Justin because he thought Justin was poisoning her.</p>

<p>The subplot is Hodges and Elisabetta. He distrusts her for being at the retreat with Santo, whom she claims is her brother. Meanwhile she worries about Hodges&rsquo; relationship with Morgan Brody, who claims they&rsquo;re just friends. But Hodges has been having second thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:79793bd525b2f827ec3386200d56e6e6">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara works with Doc Robbins in autopsy and later talks to the wife. When she goes to talk to Hodges later, and he&rsquo;s wearing a blue swimming cap with a bright flower on it, she doesn&rsquo;t want to ask, even though he claims to have worn it for her. Sara also digs deeper into the evidence, finding that Mary has a strange disease, and Justin was making a cure for her.</p>

<p>At the end, when Sara returns Justin&rsquo;s wedding ring to Mary, they discuss love, loneliness, and fear.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:910403f26969fa5afc8d20483b192183">Synopsis</h2>

<p>When a young camper, Carl Abrams, is stalked and slain in a remote area populated by Doomsday Preppers, the team investigates an underground bunker that holds several shocking surprises. Carl was dumped by an underpass by a man wearing night vision goggles, and died from having one of his hands cut off (the other was cut off anti-mortem). His leg had also been ripped apart by a bear trap. Carl was fond of camping around the mines near where the Doomsday Preppers lived.</p>

<p>The CSIs find a hidden bunker out by the mines with the help of Nick&rsquo;s dog, Sam, where traces of Carl&rsquo;s blood laces the stairs. A Prepper, Tommy, is found when they investigate, and while his room in the bunker is utilitarian, he has a second bedroom for a girl, or a women. The CSIs find a girl, Miranda, hiding in the air vents. Trace evidence on the dresses lead them to an unsolved murder of Rebecca Barnes, 11 years ago, in Carson City. Rebecca was Tommy&rsquo;s wife, and Miranda is their daughter.</p>

<p>While Tommy was out working odd jobs, Miranda was &lsquo;entertaining&rsquo; boys, one of whom was the dead Carl Abrams. The other was Luke Holland, who worked at the local supply store. Luke claims he didn&rsquo;t kil Carl, but he found the body after hooking up with Miranda, so he dumped the body. Luke also explained that Miranda didn&rsquo;t cheat on him with Carl, Carl and <em>his</em> boyfriend were using the bed for their of hookups. Carl&rsquo;s boyfriend was his best friend, Dylan Trigg.</p>

<p>It was Dylan&rsquo;s father who hunted down and killed Carl out of homophobia.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle in <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, a crime drama series that has more than 60 million viewers worldwide. Here, she tells <em>TV Choice</em> how it feels to have such an amazing fan base. But she also reflects on her other roles in <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>, and talks about her work as a conservationist campaigner</strong></p>

<p>**<em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> is currently in its 13th season. So how have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?<br />
**The biggest compliment is that last year we were the number one show in the world again. So I have to say a big thank you to all our international fans. Our ratings have also been going up this year in America. It&rsquo;s really rare for ratings to dip, then for them to go back up. Especially after all this time. Honestly, every week we go to bed wondering how we can keep on entertaining people and keep people watching.</p>

<p>**<em>Pirates Of The Caribbean</em> producer Jerry Bruckheimer is a co-creator of the show. Is he still heavily involved in its development?<br />
**Yes, I think he&rsquo;s got a creative force in all the projects he&rsquo;s a part of. We were the first TV show that his company had produced. And it&rsquo;s hard to believe that, after 13 years, we have much of the original creative team still on board.</p>

<p>**Your big break came in <em>ER</em> in the mid-Nineties. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?<br />
**For me, it was the first time that people were really going to see my work. So I was scared senseless. On the night I got the job, I honestly almost drove to Mexico, because I was so terrified. I nearly told them I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. But it was very thrilling for me to work with people who were so talented. And a great honour.</p>

<p>**And then you joined <em>The West Wing</em>&hellip;<br />
**</span><em>The West Wing</em> was one of the most special moments in my life. I never thought that someone like myself would get to be part of the political process. It was an election year in 2000 in the States, so I found myself in places in Washington DC, and I never imagined that would happen.</p>

<p>**Have you also produced a documentary about the plight of elephants in Thailand?<br />
**</span>Yes, it&rsquo;s called <em>How I Became An Elephant</em>, and it&rsquo;s about a 14 year-old-girl who travels from California to Thailand to see an elephant. It&rsquo;s a conservation film, and a film about habitat. I teamed up with a film-maker here in the US who&rsquo;d been living in Thailand since 2004. It&rsquo;s in film festivals right now. We&rsquo;re looking at a couple of companies [for distribution] but you can always look for the movie. We have a website called howibecameanelephant.com  you can find out where it&rsquo;s showing there.</p>

		<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> Our first guest made a name for herself playing strong female characters on shows like ER and The West Wing, and has been solving crimes for more than a decade as analyst Sara Sidle on the most watched TV show in the world: CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Take a look.</p>

<p>[Clip from &ldquo;Sheltered&rdquo;]</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Please welcome Jorja Fox!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &hellip; two hour The Talk special today?</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Oh yes, we&rsquo;re taking over the network. Two hour special, Affiliates take notice.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s so much to talk about</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> I know!</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Well we were just talking about disastrous vacations, in light of Heidi Klum&rsquo;s son almost drowning in the ocean. Have you ever had a disastrous vacation?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> You know, I had to really &#8212; I&rsquo;ve had so many disastrous, I had sort of sit and think about which one I wanted to talk about. Nothing nearly as excited as yours [Sharon Osborne]. I am also prone to food poisoning on the road. My family went to Europe when I was 13, I went with my mom and my dad and my grandmother, who was in her y&rsquo;know late seventies, eighties, at the time. And we take the train to Paris and, you guys have probably done this, there are several stops and we hit like &#8216;Paris North.&rsquo; And the worst part is my family speaks French. So we put my grandmother on the platform and we&rsquo;re passing bags out, like twelve bags, and the train leaves. So not only do we leave my grandmother on the platform in Paris, but it&rsquo;s the wrong platform. It isn&rsquo;t even Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> [laughing] Oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It took about two and a half hours to circle back, go back an get her. My mom was in tears, she thought she was going to have a heart attack, she&rsquo;s all alone. But she was just kind of sitting on the bags with a cappuccino. Enjoying the day. [group laughter] Yeah, that&rsquo;s my favorite disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Now, you actually had another experience in Europe, before you became an actress, when you were seventeen you moved to Italy, right? To try and be a model.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yes, &#8216;try&rsquo; is the operative word.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> But how did that go? I heard you almost ended up homeless?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know where you heard that rumor, but it&rsquo;s one of the true ones. You know, this is- My manager sent me with five-hundred dollars and said &ldquo;Take $500, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of money, you&rsquo;re going to start working right away with Seventeen.&rdquo; And I was partnered up with another model, who was all of 21, and she was going to be the smart one, you know, and sort of the savvy one. And we get there and she tells me she had <em>two</em>-hundred dollars, she didn&rsquo;t tell anyone she only had $200. We had $700, even in the 80s, in Europe, you&rsquo;re out of money pretty fast. We got kicked out of our pension and, quite honestly, a young American architectural student in Milan saved my life and let me live with him for five or six weeks, until- It was sort of the closet I ever experienced college dorm life, with a student in Milan.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> And then you moved into one of those model &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yeah, we got on our feet- We did start working. It took a little longer than we thought. And yeah, we moved into a model&rsquo;s pension, which was also like my &#8216;college&rsquo; experience.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It happened to be a girls pension, a woman&rsquo;s pension and I was one of the youngest there. Women would sneak their boyfriends in several times a week, which was kind of fun. But one of the things I loved the most, and there was so much traveling at that age, you know everybody kind of looked after each other, but there were women there from all over the world, and young girls, and &#8212; All of them, we&rsquo;d go out to dinner and you could be from Thailand, and maybe you&rsquo;re from Iceland, and you&rsquo;re from France, and everyone would speak in English together. Broken English. So the conversations were pretty simple &#8212; not because we were models &#8212; there was a launguage-</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> You joined the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation very- in the year it debuted and- [applause] Yes, and I was on it!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Alma Mater!</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> &#8212; And I loved working there. It was an incredible show. And it&rsquo;s so hard to believe that you&rsquo;re wrapping up the thirteenth season of the show. It&rsquo;s incredible for any actor to have a job for this long and to be so successful.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t happen! It just- You know when you go to acting school they prepare you. You know, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go from job to job to job to job. It&rsquo;s just kind of the nature of the business.&rdquo; And so this is a complete anomoly. None of us are prepared for it.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Does your kind of crime scene investigating skills from the show start to creep into your real life [laughter] after this long?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [faux dramatic] I know all the secrets of everyone here.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Osborne:</strong> Last season, Ted Danson joined the cast. And we love him in the show. He&rsquo;s such an amazing guy. I mean, it must be such a joy to work with him every day.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [deadpan] He&rsquo;s a terror. He&rsquo;s horrible.</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Osborne:</strong> He&rsquo;s naughty!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> He&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s amazing! He&rsquo;s one of these gentlemen, you know he&rsquo;s been in the business for years, he&rsquo;s one of my heroes as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we&rsquo;d know each other ten years. He&rsquo;s a master at intimacy. It&rsquo;s not forced, it&rsquo;s authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I swear he&rsquo;s got wings on. Like under his jacket, there&rsquo;s wings. He is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>[group &#8216;awwww&rsquo; and applause]</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s coming out later this year, and you&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&rdquo; Tell us about that.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you for asking about that. It&rsquo;s a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you&rsquo;re from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person <em>can</em> make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it&rsquo;s a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
