		<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox answer burning questions about Sara&rsquo;s return and the crime show&rsquo;s killer new season&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he most baffling crime on <em>CSI</em> last season wasn&rsquo;t a stabbing or shooting. It was a missing persons case: The show&rsquo;s lead investigator for its first nine seasons, William Petersen (Gil Grissom), left the series halfway through the year, sending <em>CSI</em>&#8216;s ratings slipping and causing concern for its cast and producers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We look at last season in a way not dissimilar from the fans,&rdquo; admits executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. &ldquo;We may have shortchanged a number of our characters in being focused on the transition from Grissom&rsquo;s team to Catherine&rsquo;s. We;ll try to make up for that this season.</p>

<p>From the opening scene, it&rsquo;s clear the mood is deadly on the graveyard shift. The team is &ldquo;fractured,&rdquo; says Mendelsohn. Enter Jorja Fox, who&rsquo;s back, at least temporarily, to help Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) get the CSIs to play nice again. But where&rsquo;s Grissom? &ldquo;The audience will know in very short order the status of Grissom and Sara,&rdquo; Mendelsohn promises. &ldquo;I can say that between the time they left and now, there are no little Grissoms out there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both Nick Stokes (George Eads) and Ray Langston (Laurence Fishburne) get promoted and start a season-long hunt for a serial killer. &ldquo;The crime scene for this killer <em>is</em> a body,&rdquo; says Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>The case may also be just the thing to bring the team together and feeling like a family again. &ldquo;We were out of our rhythm a bit last year,&rdquo; says Eads. &ldquo;We needed to go back to the garage and find what inspired us, and there&rsquo;s some good stuff with what&rsquo;s happening on the show now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That starts with the return of Fox, whose departure two seasons ago &ldquo;felt like we lost our lead guitarist,&rdquo; Eads adds. So, as <em>CSI</em> tunes up for its 10th season, <strong>TV GUIDE MAGAZINE</strong> sat down with Fox and Helgenberger to ask them questions send in by fans on [<a href="http://tvguidemagazine.com">http://tvguidemagazine.com</a> tvguidemagazine.com], and found out how the team is getting its mojo back.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What would you like to see this year on <em>CSI</em> that hasn&rsquo;t already been done?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> A musical episode! That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve talked about since Season 2. The cast has, anyway. I don&rsquo;t think the writers think it&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been advocating for the <em>CSI</em> musical episode for a long time. And not because I have any talent musically, because I don&rsquo;t. Everybody else does. Marg has a beautiful voice.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> You do, too, have talent.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I can&rsquo;t really sing. But I&rsquo;d love a dance number.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja, why did you come back to <em>CSI</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I thought it would be a heck of a lot of fun. When I said my goodbyes, with cake in my mouth and flowers in my arms, the last thing I said to the producers was I&rsquo;d love to visit. But this was very unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible Sara will return for good?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;ll just say I&rsquo;m very pleased with what they&rsquo;ve come up with to bring Sara back. You do learn a little about what she&rsquo;s been up to. I was pleasantly intrigued.</p>

<p><strong>Marg, are you happy to have Jorja back on the set so you&rsquo;re not the only woman?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna cover my ears!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Well, obviously, Lauren Lee Smith [<em>who played Riley Adams</em>] was with us last year, but there was a time before she joked us that I was the only woman, for the most part, other than Liz Vassey in the lab and Sheeri Rappaport. Not that I minded being around all these guys, &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re all really great and cool and sexy and all that stuff. but there needed to be more of a presence of female power. So I was thrilled to have Jorja back. She&rsquo;s just the coolest chick on the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine and Sara have never really had a close friendship. Will they become closer?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always wanted them to have a closer relationship. I liked the characters&rsquo; energies together. So it hasn&rsquo;t been for a lack of me wanting and asking for it. I hope it happens. We do have a couple nice scenes in the first episode.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I know very little about where we&rsquo;re going from here. Sara has pretty obvious authority issues, so when she&rsquo;s locked horns with Catherine, it&rsquo;s because Catherine&rsquo;s in a position to tell Sara what to do. In her mind, Sara believes she doesn&rsquo;t have a boss. She is her own boss. Most of their fights come out of that. They&rsquo;re very different women but blend marvelously together.</p>

<p><strong>Will we see more of Catherine as a strong supervisor this season?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Yes, you will. There is something that happens in the first episodes because someone leaks information to the press, [and the] hard-ass on the show, Ecklie [<em>Mark Vann</em>], has to come down on someone, so it&rsquo;s the leader. I think you&rsquo;ll see Catherine on top of her game, confident.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Catherine&rsquo;s had a leadership position on the show for some time. So it&rsquo;ll seem sort of seamless and subtle. But for me, it&rsquo;s exciting to see a woman in charge.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be a Grissom and Sara wedding anytime soon?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I have no idea if there&rsquo;ll be a wedding! Would I, as Jorja, like to see one? Sure. I think, even though it seems the antithesis of who Sara is, she&rsquo;d like to see one too.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think happened between Grissom and Sara after the screen went black at the end of William Petersen&rsquo;s final episode?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I think we left them happily ever after in a Costa Rican rain forest. I certainly would love to leave it at that. I liked that moment being suspended for a while. It was so slow in coming, season after season. It was something I was rooting for, and I was happy the story ended the way it did. So just let it hang there for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Will we see Catherine find love in the future?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] I think it&rsquo;s way overdue for Catherine to have a love interest! There was an ex, who was shot dead. I had a brief relationship with a guy who just wasn&rsquo;t right for me. There was the whole Warrick [<em>Gary Dourdan</em>] flirtation thing that we didn&rsquo;t really follow through on. But I&rsquo;d love to see Catherine&rsquo;s vulnerable side.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> And to see some sparks fly!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Catehrine needs somebody tall and dark. She&rsquo;s always attracted to edgy-type guys, but at this point in her life and career, she knows that&rsquo;s heading into dangerous water. I think she&rsquo;s evolved a little bit. Not that she wants somebody who is milquetoasty.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] A foot doctor?</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> Sure. He probably gives great foot massages. Which would be quite sensual. [<em>Laughs</em>] She does stand on her feet a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Would Catherine ever kiss Sara?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> We did today! At the TV Guide Magazine photo shoot. But on the show, probably not. Sara and Catherine love each other very much, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t kiss.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> We have to keep some mystery.</p>

<p><strong>Will we get to see Catherine&rsquo;s daughter, Lindsey, and her mother this season?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have my daughter be much more of a presence on the show, especially now that she&rsquo;s a young woman. That allows for some great storytelling. I can only hope there will be more.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be any more about Catherine&rsquo;s father, Sam Braun, and his legacy?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> That will definitely be there. Definitely that old-school Vegas stuff will be throughout the whole season.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the funniest thing that ever happened on the set?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Back when we were doing the &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo; episode, and George [Eads] was in the box where he&rsquo;s dying every minute he&rsquo;s in there &hellip; we get this tape in the mail from the Killer and it&rsquo;s a Turtles song. The camera&rsquo;s going around all of us, and we&rsquo;re all there. We&rsquo;re trying to analyze this tape, a critical moment in the story, and we all hear the music and start dancing to it.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> The musical episode!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Exactly!</p>

<p><strong>Do you two hang out together off set?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I keep meaning to go down to watch her surf.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> I just spent four days doing it. I&rsquo;ve been surfing for about eight years.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been down to her place but haven&rsquo;t seen her surf yet. I guess I might try doing it, too, but I&rsquo;m not as brave as she is.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Oh, boy, that&rsquo;s not true!</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] The temperature of the water is what I&rsquo;m most afraid of. If I was in Hawaii, I&rsquo;d love to do it with you.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Great! Let&rsquo;s go to Hawaii and go surfing.</p>

<p><strong>Would either of you consider joining <em>Dancing With the Stars</em> since you have the moves to blow the minds of America every week?</strong></p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> I could see where that would be a lot of fun, actually.</p>

<p><strong style="color: #339999;">Jorja:</strong> Would America be ready for dancing forensic investigators?</p>

<p><strong style="color: #9000A1;">Marg:</strong> See? It all comes back to <em>CSI: The Musical</em>. Every question comes back to that. If we keep putting it out there, it&rsquo;ll happen.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:2df5678313acf21f91c1928daa159a8b">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The episode cuts between past and present, flashing back to the events immediatly following &lsquo;Skin in the Game&rsquo; while showing us a funeral where the CSIs are noticably distraught.</p>

<p>In the past, both Jim Brass and Conrad Ecklie have trouble keeping their emotions in check, as their daughters, Morgan and Ellie, are held hostage by serial killer intent on completing his twisted homage to &lsquo;Dante&rsquo;s Inferno&rsquo;. The entire lab takes the case personally, with even David Hodges complaining that Morgan was undercover (not a role for a CSI). The SUV that kidnapped Morgan is found, sans Morgan, who is actually being held with Ellie in the outskirts of Vegas near an airport.</p>

<p>Both Larson and Tate blame each other, while still claiming their innocence. When Tate is killed in a car explosion, and the girls are still being held by the killer, it does absolve him (as does DNA). Since Larson is in custody, the CSIs are officially out of suspects until Sara and Greg decrypt the ternary DNA, filled with porn, showing that Tate was a pedophile, and Jake (the driver of the SUV that kidnapped Morgan) and his brother Matthew were two of his victims.</p>

<p>Before the CSIs find the girls, Morgan and Ellie are able to break free of their shackles, stabbing Matthew, tying him up, and making a run for it. Just outside, Ellie claims she thinks another girl is in the house. When Morgan goes back in, Matthew is missing, as Ellie did not actually tie him up. Realizing there is more danger staying in the house, Morgan runs back out only to face an armed Matthew. She manages to overpower him momentarily, disarming him in the process, and Ellie grabs the gun and shoots Matthew. While Morgan thanks her, Ellie shoots Morgan in the back.</p>

<p>Morgan survives, but claims to the CSIs that Matthew shot Morgan and Ellie killed him in self defense. The evidence does not support this, and further goes to show that Ellie <em>knew</em> Matthew: he was her fiance. They find out too late, however, as Ellie has stabbed her mother to death because Nancy knew that Ellie and Matthew were a couple. She had been helping the boys all along. While Brass talks her out of killing him, he&rsquo;s still brokenhearted over Nancy&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>In the present, the CSIs are at the funeral of Jim Brass&rsquo; ex wife, and Ellie&rsquo;s mother, Nancy.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:2df5678313acf21f91c1928daa159a8b">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Initially Sara is still in San Francisco when Morgan initial goes missing, however she had returned around the time the SUV was discovered. When Ecklie called her in, Sara checked up on and verified Father Larson&rsquo;s claims about Oliver Tate&rsquo;s ties to some of the missing girls.</p>

<p>In the lab, Sara works on processing and decrypting the dowels found in a boat in a storage room, with a dead girl. When Greg determines the dowels are in ternary, he likens it to the synthetic DNA found in the same scene, as well as in Tate&rsquo;s condo, which can be used to store data. Sara gets a court order for computers from Tate&rsquo;s old biotech company to decrypt the data, where she finds porn.</p>

<p>After the girls are rescued, Sara processes the gun and finds inconstancies between Ellie&rsquo;s story and the GSR evidence. It&rsquo;s Sara who makes the connection between Ellie and Matthew, finding photographs proving the two had prior knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:2df5678313acf21f91c1928daa159a8b">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara returns from San Francisco<br /></li>
<li>Sara believes the evidence more than Ellie, which is abnormal for her (perhaps because she&rsquo;s met Ellie before).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:2df5678313acf21f91c1928daa159a8b">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> We&rsquo;ve got a situation here.</p>

		<p><strong>Monica Gleberman</strong> .. and just ask you, how did you get involved in acting to begin with?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh my goodness. I wanted to act since I was probably four or five years old. I think that the television that sat in the living room of my house was one of the bigger influences in my life. It was definitely a babysitter for me. You know, I grew up in a small town, so there weren&rsquo;t many acting programs. And it was high school before I was able to be in a drama class. I think there were two things that happened. First of all I love it so much, and then second of all, people were really supportive of me, and doing acting. I think I had a lot of support doing it, and so there was no doubt in my mind. I went to New York and got lucky. I got in [something] very quickly because I ignored all these signs that said &ldquo;Do Not Enter.&rdquo; [laughter] I didn&rsquo;t have an agency, you know &#8216;Don&rsquo;t go beyond this point.&rsquo; And I sort of ignored all of those signs that told me not to go further and landed up in an agency, and I was able to have a conversation with my agency and I had an audition, and they started sending me out. It was so processed. But definitely I started my career in New York and was there for probably seven years before ending up in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I have followed your career, and of course I did research before this. You have had some major television show lucky jobs. Some of the biggest shows known to man. So I want to ask you, of course you were on ER, you were on The West Wing. What was it like- I know when you&rsquo;re on it, you might not think &#8216;This is huge&rsquo; and might not realize how big it is. But looking back, reflecting back on your appearances, what does that feel like? To look back and note that you were on these two shows that are probably going down in history as some of the best television?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. <em>ER</em> in particular because I started on <em>ER</em> in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. And less appointment television. I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but people had to actually turn on the TV at the right time. VCR&rsquo;s existed but even then, people wanted to a lot of the bigger shows live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. Even though I hadnât watched ER, it was my momâs favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like in a week or two&rsquo;s time, everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor. That I was just claiming to be an actor and I was terrible. So I came really close to just driving to Mexico the week before I started and forgetting the whole thing. But I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. I always felt it was a pretty incredible learning experience, to get to spend time with that caliber of people every day, writers and actors and BPs(?) and directors.</p>

<p>And absolutely the same goes for <em>West Wing</em>. I think <em>West Wing</em>&hellip; I was a huge fan then, of Sorkin, and <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> had a number of the same producers. I think the thing that surprised me the most for myself was I could get to be a part of telling a wonderful story like that. It was something that I hadn&rsquo;t even dreamed of. I just felt like it was such an honor to get to try and tell that story. I really like looked after Martin Sheen&rsquo;s daughter. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I got to do something like that! I think that Sorkin, he said at the time on <em>West Wing</em>, he&rsquo;s alone, and there had been very few women Secret Service Agents at that time, that had actually been on screen. Even getting to be that, getting to be this female Secret Service Agent was kind of a lot of fun that people hadn&rsquo;t gotten to do.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> And I know, obviously, you&rsquo;ve done a ton of movies and other TV shows, and then you land <em>CSI</em>. Which, again, another- it&rsquo;s like crazy, your career, because it&rsquo;s another huge show! So I want to go back to Season one, and what that was like, finding out you&rsquo;re going to be playing Sara, and where your mind was when you got that call.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Um. That was also a big surprise. I really didnât think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was something that was pretty different and something that I hadnât really read about often. You know, <em>Quincy</em> was sort of the thing that I could think of that sort of reminded me a little of <em>CSI</em>. And I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night, that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do. I was so wrong about that. I really thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. You know, that&rsquo;s what I thought was going to happen! I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later. And it was just this monster. Not &#8212; I guess monster&rsquo;s kind of &#8212; this behemoth that none of us expected. I think that nobody could have imagined how big the ride was going to get.</p>

<p>And thank you for saying that! I&rsquo;m actually starting my eighteenth consecutive season in a row on Prime Time television. It&rsquo;s big for me.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I know! It&rsquo;s crazy!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> So thanks for talking about that stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask- so were you surprised &#8212; before we get into Sara and where she&rsquo;s gone over the course of- and now we&rsquo;re in- there&rsquo;s gonna be a fourteenth season. I want to ask you, I know that in 2007 you had announced that you were leaving the show. Were you surprised at how many fans freaked out and started sending in gifts and money and started a campaign to try to keep you on <em>CSI</em>? Was that shocking to you at how many people cared about this character?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. It was one of the most magnificent experiences. I had no idea there would be that kind of a response. Truthfully, that was my season twelve in a row, and I was tired. I was just thinking &#8216;Oh my god, I just need to lie down for a minute.&rsquo; I just needed to kind of sit down and reground. So I wanted to get off-screen before it started to show on screen, or before my coworkers started to notice. It was an amazing show of support, and I wished I could have changed my mind to show the fans the amount of gratitude I had for them suggesting that I stay. Honestly, if I wasn&rsquo;t so exhausted, I absolutely would have. So yeah, it was an amazing feeling of surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So now that you&rsquo;re back, and you&rsquo;ve been back for a while, everyone&rsquo;s been super excited. I want to know from you how has Sara changed from season one, I know she&rsquo;s had a lot of life changes with the proposal and getting married, but how has she changed from season one to season thirteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It&rsquo;s funny. I think in some ways she really hasnât changed that much [laughs]. There&rsquo;s been some <em>seemingly</em> big changes. When we met Sara in 2000, if anything I think she was very much a product of her past and of her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be a CSI that definitely stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7, and was gone most of season 8, she had a chance to really wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character, who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested, but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of the way I&rsquo;ve been playing the character for the last couple of season. And yet at the same time, now we are in season fourteen, I do feel that Sara- there is this compulsive drive, something very deep rooted. She can&rsquo;t stop being a CSI, it&rsquo;s what fuels her, maybe the duration of her life, she&rsquo;s going to be there in the trenches, on the street, in the muck, in the darkness, trying to get justice for people. I&rsquo;m looking at it again, myself, and like &ldquo;huh!&rdquo; I thought the compulsive side of her was finished, and now maybe it&rsquo;s not, not at all. Maybe she&rsquo;s just the same.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> What can fans look forward to this season? What kind of cases? What are you guys going to get involved with, cause there&rsquo;s always a craziness happening every episode. So what can fans expect this season for the upcoming episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think so far &#8212; we are in the middle of episode 7 and I&rsquo;ve seen the script for eight, and I think we have an amazing season opening up. Really exciting. We have some incredible guest stars including somebody likeâ¦ oh you know what I donât know if I could say cause I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m a spoiler alert. [laughs] We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff â I think the writers this year again, they suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a darker season of <em>CSI</em>, but within that also there&rsquo;s going to be as much character stuff as there was last year. I think they&rsquo;re continuing to write a lot of character stuff, which is great. Certainly we start the season with Morgan in jeopardy, the stakes are really high. We also start the season with a funeral and itâs not really until we get to the end of the show that you, the audience, will come to find out why we&rsquo;re at the funeral and who has passed. Itâs a very compelling kind of suspenseful episode.</p>

<p>You know, yeah it gets crazier every year. I don&rsquo;t know how the writers come up with stuff in season fourteen. The unfortunate thing is there&rsquo;s no shortage of crazy crime in America to draw from. But the stakes continue to get higher, and I hope the fans will continue to enjoy that. I always am partial to the action/adventure show. And so in those episodes where we get a little kooky, hopefully the fans will still be able to roll with us.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I wanted to ask you, was it nice that all current cast members continued on for season fourteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely! Because we have had so many changes. You know, part of me, you were speaking about <em>ER</em>, <em>ER</em> began to lose their core cast members in season three. So the fact that our show made it to season seven with the core cast intact, I think is a testament to the show and a compliment to how much we actually did get along and liked working together and did like the work itself. I think very few shows have gone seven seasons retaining their full original cast.</p>

<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s been really nice to have a cast that&rsquo;s been able to stay together for a couple of seasons. You can&rsquo;t fake chemistry. You&rsquo;ve sort of got to build it organically. The more you know each other, the more you work together, the deeper you can go. It&rsquo;s given a chance for that. I think it&rsquo;s been kind of a really great thing for the writers, because there were a lot of seasons where it was really hard for them to start breaking stories over the summer, because they weren&rsquo;t completely sure who their cast was going to be. Knowing early enough that they were going to have everyone has allowed them to spread their wings more than they could for a bunch of season.</p>

<p>This team, this troupe of actors, you never think that &#8216;Wow, three new actors in practically one season. This is definitely- this can&rsquo;t go well. This is going to be difficult.&rsquo; And to love these three actors as much as I do, as much as we all do, we&rsquo;re having so much fun every day. I hope it shows on screen. As usual, I&rsquo;m just grateful I get to come here and hang out, because it&rsquo;s a really fun place to be.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Of course I have to ask too, season fourteen, will mark the 300th episode, which is like, nuts. So what is that? What have you guys, I think it&rsquo;s like mid-season, right? The 300th?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> The 300th? Episode five. We&rsquo;re pretty soon, like pretty pretty soon. We&rsquo;re going to do ten new shows in a row. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve done that before. And so, yeah, I think five weeks after the premiere tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the 300th episode.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So what is that like? Being a part of &hellip; I feel like a lot of this interview is about you being a part of these crazy, amazing, genius shows. And not only do you have this awesome career, but you&rsquo;re a part of another benchmark, which is the 300th episode. So what is that like, being a part of?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It was such an honor for me. You know, it is a milestone. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it going in, but then we all showed up for work the first day, and a couple people gave speeches, and I started to feel the gravity of it all. I think it&rsquo;s been a great second chance for me. I missed the 200th episode, I wasn&rsquo;t here. I was here for the 100th episode. And to get to be a part of the 300th episode meant a lot to me. More than I even imagined it would. I haven&rsquo;t done 300 episodes yet, I&rsquo;m behind several members of the cast because I did take that season off, and I don&rsquo;t appear in every episode every year. I think with my combined with my <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> I might be on episode 296 or something. I can share that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because <em>ER</em> went 300 episodes, and Marg Helgenberger, George Eads and myself had all had parts on <em>ER</em>, so with another show that the three of us can be happy for and be a part of this tiny piece of <em>ER</em> history. Of course, the history that we have on <em>CSI</em> is a lot deeper and bigger. It&rsquo;s really cool. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever going to happen to me again, to be a part of something like this. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to be possible for a lot of shows to get to do this. Most shows are doing 13 episodes a year instead of 24, which is what we started out with. It takes a long time doing 13 episodes a season to get to 300 episodes. I think this is kind of a marker we may not see that much of in the future. It meant a lot and I&rsquo;m really proud of- for everyone. I&rsquo;m really proud of everyone and just very excited to get to be a part of it. It&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask, and I know it could be a little spoiler, but in the 300th episode, I&rsquo;ve heard rumors there might be some flash backs? Is that&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Ah yes. Flashbacks slash faux-backs. [laughs] That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re calling them. We did out best. It has been thirteen years. [laughs] Thirteen meaningful years. But it was truly fun and embarrassing and silly to try and do it- I hope we pulled it off. I hope the fans enjoy it. There&rsquo;s- You know it&rsquo;s not a huge chunk of the show, but three flashbacks. Four I think! We go back to 2000. There&rsquo;s some funny clothes, and funny hairstyles. I threw in a wig. And it&rsquo;s great. We do, we&rsquo;re- the episode is really about a cold case from 2000, that has certainly haunted Sara for the last thirteen years. And I think it, within the show, Sara feels a certain exuberance at having a second chance at a case she thought had really slipped through her fingers.</p>

<p>So not only did I get a second chance to be a part of something so exciting, but she&rsquo;s getting a second chance to really try and find justice for somebody who&rsquo;s living a nightmare several times.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Is there anything else you want to tell to the fans who are super excited &#8212; they&rsquo;re counting down the hours to the premiere. Is there anything you want to say to them? Anything about the season or just in general that you want them to know?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think yes. I wanna say to all the fans of CSI, thank you so much! Thank you thank you thank you thank you for your support all these years. We are continually surprised and completely elated that we get ratings every years, that we continue to get to be on this show and do these things, that&rsquo;s all because of you. Thank you for your loyalty and your willingness to go on some really crazy rides with us. I hope this year we don&rsquo;t disappoint you and we&rsquo;re really excited to show you what we have coming up.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Okay! Great! Those were all my questions.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Thank you so much, Monica, it was great speaking with you.</p>

		<p>Dog fighting rings, canned hunting, factory farming, and even the cruelty behind shark fin soup have all been topics on the popular CBS drama &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;, and actress &ldquo;&lsquo;Jorja Fox&rdquo;&rsquo; takes pride in her shows coverage of these issues. Jorja plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the long running series. In real life, she volunteers as an ambassador for Animal Defenders International.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calling attention to these issueswhether it is on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; or with Animal Defenders Internationalis a passion of mine,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;&ldquo;CSI&rdquo;s writers care about these issues too, and do such a great job in weaving them into the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;ADI Ambassador&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jorja, who has been on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; since its inception in 2000, considers herself fortunate to have landed a role that she cherishes. She also is grateful to be a spokesperson for Animal Defenders International (ADI). &ldquo;Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, the husband and wife team who founded ADI, have done so much to call attention to rescue and to stop animal abuse,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;Im honored to work with them and to serve as an ambassador for ADI.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ADI, which was launched in 1990, publishes reports, educates the public, and drafts legislation for animals worldwide. One of their latest animal welfare projects was exposing the cruel treatment of circus animals in Bolivia. &ldquo;They went undercover to rescue and relocate 29 circus lions via airlift to safe sanctuaries in the United States,&rdquo; says Jorja. (A short film about the rescue can be seen on ADIs website.)</p>

<p>Through her work at ADI, Jorja has done public service announcements and testified before Congress. Jorja is a 2012 recipient of ADIs Animal Champion Award for her dedication to sustaining safe environments for animals in entertainment.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;A Long Time Love Affair with Animals&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Born in New York City, Jorja moved with her family to Melbourne Beach, FL, when she was about three. &ldquo;Its a barrier island, and there was a lot more wildlife back then than there is now,&rdquo; she laments. &ldquo;You could see dolphins in the ocean, sea turtles, and even alligators. It was the wilderness for my parents, who are both from New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learned a lot about conservation from my grandmother, and my family always cared about animals,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;Caring for the environment impacts all of uspeople and animals. We had a family dog, and lots of wildlife around us, which I grew to appreciate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, she has a three-year old rescue dog, which she says, &ldquo;is the most brilliant dog in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Animals and the Environment&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of people dont see the connection between animal extinction and the environment,&rdquo; says Jorja, who recently produced an award winning documentary called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant&rdquo;, which tracks the journey of a young girl who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. &ldquo;People dont know that without elephants there would be horrible droughts,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Elephants are known as a keystone species because of their impact on their environment and their impact on other species that share their space. &ldquo;Elephants are very good at finding underground water,&rdquo; Jorja explains. &ldquo;They locate water and dig watering holes. Without that water, other animals and humans would be harmed. Mass extinctions could occur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elephants also disperse seeds through their digestive systems. Thanks to elephants who spread these seeds, more plants appear, which other animals are dependent on. &ldquo;Its an important cycle,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;That is why we all need to care about animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Looking at your filmography, you’ve been on a ton of great shows with some amazing actors, <em>Reaper</em>, <em>House</em>, <em>Buffy</em>. Was there an actor you worked with that really surprised you?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been so lucky that I just walked on set after set with just such welcoming actors, and that’s great because you hear horror stories. But I remember having to do a very emotional scene on <em>CSI</em>, and at the time, <em>CSI</em> was the #1 show, 30 million viewers each week, absurd numbers, you would think that if there was one set there would be big egos, it would be that set. But I had this one emotional scene across from Jorja Fox. She was so gracious and open and warm, it helped me get to where I needed to be. I remember that vividly. They shot me first, she was so patient. I had to excuse myself from the set for a moment, and she was so open to what I needed as an actor. Here I was just a guest spot, and she was a regular on the #1 show on television, and she was focused on making me comfortable.</p>
