		<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> I have to congratulate you guys on 300 episodes.</p>

<p>[audience cheers]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> [pointing at Eric] He&rsquo;s the only man in the pilot. Right here. All 300.</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> You&rsquo;ve been there since the first season, but I heard, Jorja, that you didn&rsquo;t think the show was gonna take off.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No, and I can say that we&rsquo;re [Jorja and Eric] getting old. [laughter] I can&rsquo;t speak for you guys [Elisabeth and Ted] at all. When I see a grey hair on his [Eric&rsquo;s] head, I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;m out. That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s over. [group laughter] I though, &ldquo;Okay it&rsquo;s this show about death. It&rsquo;s gonna be on a Friday night. Death in the Western Hemisphere culture, not so much.&rdquo; I thought we were doomed. I thought we were gonna do six shows and we were canceled. I knew <em>I</em> loved it! And I still love it. It&rsquo;s weird&hellip; we&rsquo;re still here.</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p>[audience applause]</p>

<p>[interview with Eric, Elisabeth, and Ted]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Now Jorja. The show is so serious, and you guys have such a great sense of humor, but it must get dark on the set at times because of the content. What do you do between takes to lighten the mood?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, as a matter of fact, we have one of the great funny men of all time on the show now: Mr. Ted Danson. [audience laughter and cheers] And he &#8212; he does some dancing. He was a competitive dancer, yeah, and many times, when it gets a little intense, you dance.</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> You know what it is? My hips are going. I fall. [audience laughter] I sway and fall and it looks like a dance.</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Are you gonna bust a move?</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> Yeah! We were hoping that &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Come on, you&rsquo;ve got to. One or two steps.</p>

<p>[audience cheers this idea on]</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> I&rsquo;ll dance, if Jorja &#8212; cause she does these funny things where she takes her clothes off-</p>

<p>[The Talk ladies break into hysterics, Jorja laughs]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Fair is fair!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Not in these heels, they&rsquo;re not right for a dance.</p>

<p><strong>Ted Danson:</strong> No no! I will, but you&rsquo;ve got to [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> We want to keep it PG here! Maybe later Ted will bust a move. [&hellip;]eros as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we&rsquo;d know each other ten years. He&rsquo;s a master at intimacy. It&rsquo;s not forced, it&rsquo;s authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I swear he&rsquo;s got wings on. Like under his jacket, there&rsquo;s wings. He is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>[group &#8216;awwww&rsquo; and applause]</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s coming out later this year, and you&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&rdquo; Tell us about that.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you for asking about that. It&rsquo;s a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you&rsquo;re from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person <em>can</em> make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it&rsquo;s a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: I was blown away by it, it was so different and I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything ever like it. A show about death, on a Friday night? This is going to be canceled in six weeks, no one&rsquo;s going to watch this! America&rsquo;s not gonna watch this show! And boy was I &hellip; that was extremely wrong about that! [breaks up laughing]</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: It&rsquo;s a great place to go back to. And also, under the umbrella of justice and truth and really trying to get to the heart of a very sad story is really awesomely compelling, I think, for us to get to tell.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: Being on a successful show is the cooling thing that could ever happen to a person. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything. But I think &hellip; I show up because I love being with the people that I get to work with every day.</p>

		<p>Over 14 seasons and 300 episodes, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has concocted some wild plots and brought in memorable guest stars to keep the body-bagging business fresh and fun. We asked the cast - including Marg Helgenberger, who reprises her role as Catherine Willows for Wednesday&rsquo;s landmark 300th episode, which flashes back to a case the team failed to crack in 2000 - to reflect on the show&rsquo;s best installments, selected by longtime executive producer Carol Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;1. Blood Drops (Season 1, Episode 7)&ldquo;&rsquo; A 6-year-old Dakota Fanning plays the surviving daughter of a family that&rsquo;s been butchered in their home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nightmares frm time to time about this one,&rdquo; admits Jorja Fox (Sara). &ldquo;Grissom [William Petersen] and Sara arrived so quickly after the murders that you could still feel the horrible events. I had one line - &#8216;Her soul&rsquo;s still in the room&rsquo; - which has stayed with me as [emblematic] of the entire series.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;7. Law of Gravity (Season 7, Episode 15)&ldquo;&rsquo; A cop threatens to expose the dark past of fill-in boss Keppler (Liev Schreiber) if he doesn&rsquo;t make the evidence in a case go away. &ldquo;What a joy it was to have Liev with us for four episodes when Billy [Petersen] went to Chicago to do a play,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;But we all knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to end well for Keppler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;10. CSI on Fire (Season 13, Episode 8)&ldquo;&rsquo; A mass grave in the desert is linked to an accused serial killer whom Finlay (Elisabeth Shue) pursued when she worked in Seattle. &ldquo;Once in a while, the case is so close to your character that you get emotionally connected, which makes for deeper, richer scenes,&rdquo; says Shue, who adds that she enjoyed making out with Finlay&rsquo;s ex-husband (Cougar Town&rsquo;s Brian Van Holt) at the end of the episode. According to Fox, &ldquo;This storyline will come back later this season, when Fin will have to confront her past in Seattle so she can bravely help out Greg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CSI airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on CBS.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox is best known for her role as Dr. Maggie Doyle in the television medical drama <em>ER</em>. Since then, Fox has had many successful appearances in television shows including <em>The West Wing</em> and most recently <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> playing Sara Sidle. Fox talks about her career, how <em>CSI</em> changed her life, and what fans could expect this season.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What does it feel like to reflect on your career and know that you have been on some of the biggest shows in history like <em>ER</em></strong></p>

<p>Fox: Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. I started on ER in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. People had to actually turn on the TV at the right time a lot of the bigger shows people wanted to watch live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. I hadnt watched ER and it was my moms favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor and that I wasnt a good actorits just crazy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: So after <em>ER</em> you did a ton of television shows and then you land <em>CSI,</em> which again is another huge show. Where was your mind set when you heard you got the role of Sara?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: That was also a big surprise. I really didnt think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was really different and something that I hadnt really read about oftenbut I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do and I was so wrong about that. I thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How has Sara changed from Season one to Season thirteen?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think in someways she really hasnt changed that much [laughs]. When we met Sara in 2000 I think she was very much a product of her past and her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be apart of CSI that stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7 and was gone most of season 8 she had a time to wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself. Here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of how I have been playing the character.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What can fans look forward to this season?</strong></p>

<p>Fox: I think so far we are in the middle of episode 7. I think we have an amazing season opening up and some great guest stars like oh you know what I dont know if I could say. We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff  I think the writers this year again suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper. We start the season with a funeral and its not really until we get to the end of the episode that we find out why we are all there and whose funeral it is, who has passed. Its a very compelling and suspenseful episode.</p>
