&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d make a joke about deja vu, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the memory anomaly at the center of &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, which first hit American theaters in limited release on March 16, 2001 – 15 years ago this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox appears in a small role, as Leonard&amp;rsquo;s wife in his flashbacks. She was essentially unknown at the time, but just a few months later she&amp;rsquo;d become much better-known to mainstream audiences when she joined the first-season cast of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SELLER:&lt;/strong&gt; Jorja Fox&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;LOCATION:&lt;/strong&gt; Los Angeles, CA&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PRICE:&lt;/strong&gt; $1.85 million&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SIZE:&lt;/strong&gt; (approx.) 3,600 square feet, 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR MAMA’S NOTES:&lt;/strong&gt; A well-maintained, circa 1937 Mediterranean with loads of intact original architectural details in the hipster-chic Silver Lake area of Los Angeles — owned, according to our resources, by actress and producer Jorja Fox — has come available at $1.85 million. Miz Fox isn’t a tabloid superstar or even a gossip glossy regular, and we’d bet the farm she prefers it that way. She is, none-the-less, a veteran staple of the medical drama and police procedural genres. Prominent recurring roles on “ER” and “The West Wing” and a guest turn on “Law &amp;amp;Order” led to a recently ended 15-year run in a pivotal role on the internationally popular “CSI.” Along the way, multi-talented Miz Fox co-founded Honeypot Productions, an experimental theater company in Los Angeles, appeared in the historic 1997 “coming out” episode on “Ellen,” and produced two animal-oriented documentaries (“How I Became and Elephant” and “Lion Ark”). She also produced the short-lived, limited run 2007 one-woman musical in Los Angeles, “Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield,” that years later was remounted in a revised, expanded version Off Broadway as “Forever Dusty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property records suggest the Silver Lake property was purchased by the gap-toothed former fashion model and staunch vegetarian in May 2004 for $1.2 million, and current listing details show the two-story residence, set high and privately on a street-to-street hillside parcel in a quiet pocket of the still artsy and increasingly pricey community, has a total of five bedrooms and three bathrooms in about 3,600 square feet. For the lazy and/or infirm, it’s two forbidding flights from the street to an inset porch where Miz Fox — or, perhaps, a professional stager — placed a pillow-laden wooden bench where one can take a well-earned breather after the long hike up and/or take in the lovely, over-the-rooftops view the elevated perch allows. It’s one step down from the small — some might call it uncomfortably cramped — pentagram-shaped entrance vestibule to the well-proportioned but far short of gigantic 24-foot-long living room that sports honey-hued narrow-gauge hardwood floors, probably original wood-framed casement windows, a fireplace with red brick surround, ceiling beams dressed up with carved corbels, and a towering arched window that, like the front porch, provides a panoramic view that sweeps over the surrounding rooftops and encompasses the Ivanhoe Reservoir, the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign. The dining room, 17-feet long and far from square with seven sides, links through to a much more traditionally four-walled breakfast room. Black ceramic countertops on the built-in buffet in the breakfast room are repeated in the adjoining galley-style kitchen that features original tile on the walls and backsplashes along with pale and prosaic raised panel wood cabinets and up-to-date, medium-grade stainless steel appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three upper-floor bedrooms, each behind an intricately inlaid wood door, open off a double wide and sky-lit, eight-sided corridor that features built-in linen cabinets and built-in desk area. The larger two bedrooms, one with a bay window that looks out to the backyard, both have generous, windowed walk-in closets and share a spacious and restored vintage bathroom. Since we’re an easy sucker for a little bit of authentic patina in a home, this property gossip is pleased to see the original tile work was retained although we admit the flesh color of the tiles isn’t optimal. The smallest of the three bedrooms on the upper floor has a petite walk-in closet and direct access to a small and well-maintained if perfectly ordinary bathroom that also opens off the mud room behind the kitchen. The lower level, the legality of which is to be verified by the buyer according to online marketing materials, comes in at about 1,100 square feet and includes a family room/media lounge with separate exterior entrance and a linear kitchenette with two-drawer dishwasher, refrigerated drawer, and a slender, under-counter wine fridge. Two more bedrooms, one painted deep turquoise with walk-in closet and the other lined with decidedly contemporary built-in wardrobes, share a hall bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the upper level of the residence one must pass less than elegantly through the mud room to access the walled and terraced backyard where a lower patio has basket weave pattern red brick terracing and an upper level deck, backed by a tall privacy wall and a vine-draped pergola, overlooks a koi pond that waterfalls down to a second koi pond. A detached structure at the upper rear of the property contains a two-car garage and a notably roomy if somewhat inconveniently located laundry room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research suggests Miz Fox has decamped Silver Lake for the western end of the Los Feliz neighborhood where in May 2014 she dropped $2.825 million on an formidably boxy, mid-’70s red-brick contemporary pavilion that opens through an double-height arched colonnade to a stone-tiled plaza and swimming pool and, some persnickety people we know might stamp their feet and complain, looks a tetch more like a Midwestern bank branch than a private residence in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVC: So were you happy to come back in order for Gil and Sara to literally sail off into the sunset?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WP:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, yeah, that was kind of… [Hesitates.] I mean, what are you going to do after all these years and everything, and you’re supposed to do a wrap-up in two hours? If they’d said, “Why don’t you do a wrap-up over several episodes?” we’d’ve done something different. But they sort of just sprang it on us after they canceled the show. They said, “Do you want to say goodbye?” And it was, like, “How do you do that?” We had to write it in six weeks and shoot it in four and then put it on the air. It was a cram job to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they had asked me, “What do you think Grissom’s been doing?” And I said, “Well, I think he’s in the ocean. I think he’s sick of dead bodies and bugs, and he wants to save fish.” So we put that together, and then they said, “Well, what are we going to do about you and Sara? The fans are desperate for you to deal with that.” So I said, “Well, just let ’em sail off into the sunset!” [Laughs.] I mean, if that’s what they want, why at this point would we care? Give ’em what they want! And I just thought it was sort of nice, in that we’d tried to stay away from that stuff all along. We even tried at the end to just keep it as simple as possible: off they go onto the boat. So I was good with it. I just hope that the fans, the people who watched it, were happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; You love wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; You look great. So tell me, why is it so important to be at this event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most important events that you could attend in Los Angeles. Bringing attention to environmental awareness, which is at such a critical, frightening stage right now. I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to celebrate &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jorjafox.net/library/library/advocacy/racing-extinction/&#34;&gt;Racing Extinction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tonight, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of seeing it already. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the greatest films I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; Why so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s a context that the filmmakers are able to sort of just put everything in perspective, and share it in such a way that you feel it cerebrally. You feel it in your heart, you feel it through your body. You just want to get up and do something. It&amp;rsquo;s also a hopeful film, believe it or not. You don&amp;rsquo;t leave the theater going &amp;lsquo;Oh well. Everything&amp;rsquo;s lost.&amp;rsquo; Which is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s amazing. That you so much for being here. We&amp;rsquo;re gonna let you get down the carpet, &amp;lsquo;cause everyone wants to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee:&lt;/strong&gt; But we&amp;rsquo;ll see you inside. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-praise-of-csi-s-happy-ending:ae6661f2a439b56472bd0f6031fa6455&#34;&gt;In Praise of CSI&amp;rsquo;s Happy Ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Several years ago, I wrote to you regarding my extreme disappointment in &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; for divorcing Grissom and Sara, the series&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;long ship&amp;rdquo; known as GSR. Well, you were the voice of reason, saying that you hoped William Petersen would be back for the end. Thankfully, you were right. Although I still think they should not have been separated, the end of the finale was oh so satisfying. Grissom and Sara sailing off into the sunset was a much-welcomed cliché. The finale was good, old-school &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; with lots of throwbacks to the past, and the ending was absolutely beautiful. Nicely done for a show about death. The onscreen magic of Petersen and Jorja Fox will be missed, but the memories now are all good ones. Thanks to the cast and crew, and to Anthony Zuiker, for making it happen. — &lt;em&gt;Jen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Roush:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the sailing off into the sunset fadeout was a bit corny, it seemed appropriate, and most important, satisfying to the fans. When wrapping up a show with this much history and baggage, giving the faithful viewer a payoff should be a top priority. (Are you listening, &lt;em&gt;Castle&lt;/em&gt;?) If Grissom hadn&amp;rsquo;t come back for the final chapter, it would have been much more disappointing for everyone. So kudos for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/2015/lylapalooza/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CSI star Jorja Fox takes time out to chat with Lyla about dogs, insects, and ice cream. Special guest appearance by Belle the puppy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; This is Lylapalooza and we have Jorja Fox on our show today. Hello, Jorja, how are you today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I am very good, Lyla, how are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Good. This is my shnuffler. Shnuffle. Do you have anything to say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Belle the Puppy:** *silence*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay! So.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. For our first question. Jorja, what would your favorite color be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I think my favorite color, and it changes a lot but right now it&amp;rsquo;s blue. Cuz it reminds me of the ocean and sky and the nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. The same with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh really? Profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; I also really like orange right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Me too! Cuz it&amp;rsquo;s like the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Mmm hmm! And the sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; For our second question today, with Jorja Fox. Jorja &amp;hellip; Hmm. What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite insect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite insect is dragonflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; I personally like bumblebees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Bumblebees are amazing. And you know what else? Maybe fireflies too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yes! And ladybugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Ladybugs, of course! It&amp;rsquo;s hard to- you can&amp;rsquo;t maybe pick one favorite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; This is hard! What is your favorite animal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite animal has to be my dog, Bexar. She&amp;rsquo;s like a poodle mix. But her full name is Bexar County Rodeo Princess. She&amp;rsquo;s from Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; That makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. What is your favorite article of clothing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite article of clothing is sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; I like sweatshirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweatshirts are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; What is your favorite &amp;hellip; hmm &amp;hellip; way to help animals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite way to help animals is to &amp;hellip; not eat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; My favorite way to help animals is &amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like to litter. I never litter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;rsquo;t do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t litter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Me either. No, that&amp;rsquo;s terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; So bad for the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Bad for the seals and the sea turtles and the dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; And everything that can eat stuff off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; And the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Belle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Like Belle! Like baby. Okay. For our sixth question, what&amp;rsquo;s your favorite type of music?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I love all music. Like every kind, it&amp;rsquo;s my favorite thing in the whole world. But if I had to pick a favorite style it would probably be &amp;hellip; like &amp;hellip; Jazz. Maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; Jorja! What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite type of ice cream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, Lyla. I think my favorite kind of ice cream is called Kind Cream. And it&amp;rsquo;s the cookies&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;cream flavor. Classic cookies&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;cream. And they used the cookies they get them from Baby Cakes Bakery in New York City. What about you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; I like &amp;hellip; Hmmm &amp;hellip; So my three favorites would probably be- I just have three favorites because I can&amp;rsquo;t choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t choose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; So I have cotton candy, chocolate, aaaaand &amp;hellip; So there&amp;rsquo;s an ice cream store on Fire Island, it&amp;rsquo;s called Unfriendly&amp;rsquo;s Ice Cream, and one of their flavors is called Play-doh. It&amp;rsquo;s vanilla ice cream dyed yellow, with little bits of cookie chunks in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyla:&lt;/strong&gt; And they&amp;rsquo;re dyed blue and orange and red to look like play-doh. This is Lylapalooza signing out! Good bye! Goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Bye!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shark Allies</title>
      <link>http://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/2015/shark-allies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/transcript/2015/shark-allies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jorja Fox talks about her personal connection to the ocean and her perception of trophy hunting and the misrepresentation of sharks in the media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Connection to the Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend as much time on the water as I can. I&amp;rsquo;ve been bodyboarding since I was about six and surfing for about the last fifteen years. So I&amp;rsquo;m there, you know, several times a week if I can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, when you think of how mankind kind of evolved on earth, it was this battle&lt;br /&gt;
between man and nature. Man needed to dominate nature in order to survive. And we won that battle a long time ago. Now, you know, our job and and our kids&amp;rsquo; job is to figure out the balance on the planet. I guess at the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s really important to know that that without the ocean, human survival will end. We need fish for our own survival and we need water and oxygen for out own survival. The ocean makes the bulk of the world&amp;rsquo;s oxygen. If the oceans are sick, then the balance of the entire planet will fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot survive without a healthy ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharks and the Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shark programing, I think it&amp;rsquo;s been very, very unfortunate you know in the last twenty or thirty years. On one hand, we know more about sharks than we ever did, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to sharks more than we could have ever imagined. But so much of that information has been negative information or kind of information that&amp;rsquo;s more for to instill fear in people or to instill cheap kinda thrills, action packed thrills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media, whether it&amp;rsquo;s been intentional or not, often focuses on stories that are gonna have a shock value for people, that are going to get people&amp;rsquo;s attention. So, often, that&amp;rsquo;s what sharks have have done inadvertently to people, or how people have been harmed by sharks. But I think what would be really important piece of this puzzle is if the media could start focusing on on how we are affecting short survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trophy Hunting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sport fishing, in my opinion, and hunting for sport is kind of something that should go the way the history books. Something that people did. We don&amp;rsquo;t do that anymore. Now we&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to create sustainable habitat for wildlife and for sea life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time where lead paint was a great idea and where asbestos was a great idea. And both of them are sort of human ingenuity and we kind of&lt;br /&gt;
realized &amp;ldquo;Okay, well that was then and let&amp;rsquo;s build things differently now and and and do things differently now because that&amp;rsquo;s not sustainable for us anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well me, personally, I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of any kind of hunting and that would include commercial and sport fishing. It&amp;rsquo;s just not something that I really understand and &amp;hellip; I think I would invite anybody who does enjoy that activity to take a few moments and ask themselves what about killing is so satisfying for them. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure where the the sport or the fun is in that and I would encourage people just ask that question to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/news/2015/channel-guide-magazine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point in the episode, another woman blows herself up, this time, it&amp;rsquo;s a Lady Heather doppleganger outside of the mistresses&amp;rsquo; house. When the lookalike&amp;rsquo;s car explodes, Brass catches on fire, but once he&amp;rsquo;s extinguished by a fast-acting Sara, he stands there like a total bad-ass, proving once again that the former captain&amp;rsquo;s cajones are made of â¦ well, brass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gil&amp;rsquo;s in Vegas, sees his ex-wife Sara (#Awkward), and runs into a chipper redhead who flummoxes him to no end. Gil acts like an old, confused man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Heather is older, and I still want to slap her smug mug SOoooo hard, which is a testament to the sexy, complex and challenging character that actress Melinda Clarke has played intermittently throughout the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara still hates Lady Heather. Me too. I&amp;rsquo;m totally #TeamSara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara and Gil are divorced, but Sara still loves the bug-loving lug. And finally, we get to see Gil talk to some bugs, because it&amp;rsquo;s just not a Gil-centric episode if we don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; get to see him 1) Talk to bugs, 2) use the Latin name for a bug, 3) turn his head quizzically and look at something/ someone. Ding! Ding! Ding! Three for three! Bonus: Gil got to wear lots of goofy looking-hats in this episode. And, he seemingly trained bees in a matter of minutes, like the bug-whisperer he&amp;rsquo;s always been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bees tell Gil where the murder is (in a scary, yet technologically awesome, shack!). Lo and behold! It&amp;rsquo;s the Green Mile guy. Called it. He&amp;rsquo;s got a bomb vest, and he&amp;rsquo;s set up a bunch of bombs in a Las Vegas parking structure; requiring Catherine, Greg and Morgan to do some fancy wire-cutting. And even though she&amp;rsquo;s been on the show since Season 11, when she was in a L.A/Las Vegas crossover episode, Morgan&amp;rsquo;s hands still have the shakes. Once they&amp;rsquo;re not dead, Morgan and Greg hug and I hope for a moment that they&amp;rsquo;ll make out, because when has Greg ever gotten any action? He&amp;rsquo;s always been in friend zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gil convinces the mad bomber/ murderer not to blow himself up, because he deduces that the bomb vest isn&amp;rsquo;t even activated. Murder man hates Gil because he blames Gil for Lady Heather leaving her role as a dom, and then stopping the boning her therapy patients, and then stopping her psychiatry practice altogether. Guy really loves his Lady Heather time. Gil tells a story about a whale whose mate can&amp;rsquo;t hear his song, which makes no sense even though I think it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be about the man&amp;rsquo;s unrequited love for LH, but is sad, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catherine wants out of the FBI and wants to gank the Director&amp;rsquo;s job that Sara wants. What mom doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be her daughter&amp;rsquo;s boss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gil wraps everything up with Lady Heather (I don&amp;rsquo;t care if she&amp;rsquo;s a doctor, she&amp;rsquo;ll always be a dominatrix to me) and he thanks her for making able to love someone like Sara. It&amp;rsquo;s sweet, but he&amp;rsquo;s also giving her some police procedural info, which makes me scratch my head: Why are they letting the consultant run the case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Sara gets the director&amp;rsquo;s position, and even takes photos with her new badge so that&amp;rsquo;ll be #Awkward due to Catherine&amp;rsquo;s conversation of about 20 seconds ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for a few seconds, you think that the Sara and Gil ship has sailed, but with a gentle nudge from newbie Lindsay, Sara watches Lady Heather&amp;rsquo;s statement interview with Gil where he admits his love for Miss Sidle. Suddenly, Sara arrives at Gil&amp;rsquo;s San Diego boat dock in a taxi, because clearly Sara&amp;rsquo;s rather call a cab than ask her longtime pak Nick Stokes for a ride. (Another missed chance for George Eads to do something in this ep.). Gil is wearing yet-another hat, this time it&amp;rsquo;s one that he stole from Ernest Hemmingway. Sarah boards Gil&amp;rsquo;s ship and when they embrace, you know that it&amp;rsquo;ll be Gil + Sara forever. While they sail away from San Diego, I can&amp;rsquo;t help wonder why Sara brought only her small messenger bag with her, and I hope they didn&amp;rsquo;t run that picture of her shaking hands with the commish in the newspaper because she&amp;rsquo;s gone. I guess Catherine gets the job as CSI director by default. Because really, with Sara gone, it&amp;rsquo;s the inmates running the asylum with Morgan, Greg and Hodges (and now newbie Lindsay) left in the department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Lady Heather&amp;rsquo;s rivalry with Sara Sidle over the years, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone wanted her to be a true terrorist, and &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; obliges. It&amp;rsquo;s a frame job, and when the real terrorist shows up&amp;ndash;he&amp;rsquo;s played by frequent baddie Doug Hutchinson&amp;ndash;we know immediately where the episode is going. Regardless, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, as this was an episode about bringing together the original team and sending them off in a way that pleased fans who showed up earlier in the show&amp;rsquo;s run as well as the fans who stuck around for the series over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ted Danson and the new players&amp;ndash;minus Elisabeth Shue and George Eads&amp;rsquo; characters&amp;ndash;are players in the new episode, it really is an episode that is about the original characters, many of whom left at some point but came back for the movie. Willows, Grissom and Sidle get the most screentime (there&amp;rsquo;s even a bees-oriented scene!). And when Lady Heather eventually does show up, she helps with the case but also helps the tension between Grissom and Sidle to subside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads us to the lovely final few minutes of the series, when Grissom tells the bomber that he understands bombs as much as he understands oceans, talking to the criminal about a whale and comparing the whale to the bomber&amp;rsquo;s ultimate love for Lady Heather. Catherine Willows decides to put her &amp;lsquo;hat in the ring&amp;rsquo; for a director&amp;rsquo;s position, and D.B. Russell packed up and got ready to go. While we got closure for many of the main characters, the best moment was when Sara decided to come with him on his boat to try a relationship again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in years, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t mean tonight wasn&amp;rsquo;t a total emotional roller coaster for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched every single episode for the first nine seasons at least, and even stuck around for a couple more after Grissom left (and broke my heart in the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved CSI, and I never really stopped loving it. I just kind of grew up and apart from the show, just as the original characters grew apart from each other (looking at you, Grissom and Sara).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, tonight&amp;rsquo;s two-hour finale, which reunited Gil Grissom (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;William Petersen&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;), Sara Sidle (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;), Catherine Willows (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Marg Helgenberger&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;), Jim Brass (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Paul Guilfoyle&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;), David Hodges (&amp;ldquo;Wallace Langham&amp;rdquo;), the aforementioned Greg, and even Grissom&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous dominatrix friend/foe Lady Heather (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Melinda Clarke&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;), felt like a trip back to my teen years in a way I should have expected but totally didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like no time had passed at all, both for me and for the show. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I have social studies homework due tomorrow, and that I should go to bed (as soon as I&amp;rsquo;m finished updating my LiveJournal with all my Grissom/Sara thoughts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional through-line of the finale was obviously Sara and Grissom reuniting since getting divorced however long ago that was. They both ended up admitting separately to Lady Heather that they were still in love with each other, but it took Lindsey hinting to Sara that she should watch Grissom&amp;rsquo;s interrogation of Lady Heather for her to get that. In the end, she and Grissom sailed off into the sunset on his little boat, which is just as things should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a fan standpoint, I loved everything about everything that I just saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the episode with a more critical eye, that was totally and completely ridiculous. Obviously, the bomber was Doug Hutchison. Obviously, Sara and Grissom were destined to be together again. Obviously, all bombs (and there were a lot of bombs) that endangered anyone we cared about were diffused at the very last second. Obviously, bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Confession: I have never purposefully watched an episode of CSI. Or any of its spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah and Catherine, are they frenemies? I feel tension? I feel history? Tempted to Google, but that feels like cheating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait, Sarah and Petersen were MARRIED?! Is that why there was tension with her and Marg&amp;rsquo;s character?! Love it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah and Gil&amp;rsquo;s (I&amp;rsquo;ll call him that from now on, not Petersen) first encounter. Tension&amp;rsquo;s so thick you can cut it with a shark fin. Ted Danson also meets him for the first time and I had no idea there wasn&amp;rsquo;t ever any crossover with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the exposition, Sarah. Caught up on their relationship drama. &amp;ldquo;Seeing you again left me a little speechless,&amp;rdquo; is a pretty good line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, so I guess Catherine and Gil were NOT a thing? So my Gil shipping order currently is 1. Lady Heather. 2. Catherine. 3. Sarah. Sorry, not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah getting the swabs from the suspects&amp;rsquo; mouths is the most I&amp;rsquo;ve liked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarah still loves Gil. Lady Heather doesn&amp;rsquo;t love Gil. I guess I have to update my ranking. Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ha, Gil is reprimanding the bees. He&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful weirdo. Sarah interrupts and they have A MOMENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Gil&amp;rsquo;s wearing another hilarious hat, albeit this is for bee-keeping. And Sarah is wearing one, too. Bow-chicka-wow-wow. Also, how are bees now an integral part of this case? I&amp;rsquo;m confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vegas is lucky to have you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The oceans are lucky to have you.&amp;rdquo; Deep. &amp;ldquo;I hope you find what you are looking for out there!&amp;rdquo; BUT HE&amp;rsquo;S ALREADY FOUND IT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gil and Lady Heather have quite the goodbye. Why he loves Sarah? &amp;ldquo;She helped me with my crossword puzzles.&amp;rdquo; True love right there, people. But he says he&amp;rsquo;s going to miss her for the rest of his life. Or you could just be together? Why do you need to be such a drama queen, you can be with her!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah went to him! I love that they chose not to have the actors say anything. So much more powerful with no words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then they rode off into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox, one of the show&amp;rsquo;s original cast members, has said in previous interviews that she didn&amp;rsquo;t think anyone would watch the series when it first premiered in 2000. She could not have been more wrong. The drama about a forensics investigation division in Las Vegas was an instant smash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its 15-year run, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; spawned three spinoffs and became one of TV&amp;rsquo;s most popular series, in the U.S. and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other cast member, Fox, who played investigator Sara Sidle, was extremely appreciative that the show was given a final bow: &amp;ldquo;It was such a great gift. I was thrilled. And the finale was truly a love letter to our fans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox added that working again with William Petersen, who played investigator Gil Grissom, and Marg Helgenberger, who played Catherine Willows, was exciting. &amp;ldquo;Us all being back together felt like the most natural thing in the world. It was such a joy to have them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main attractions for fans of the series was the romance between Grissom and Sidle. And the finale featured them in a tough situation. After getting married years ago, things started to go wrong and they divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A fatal explosion in a casino brings the retired Grissom back to Vegas, where he has a tense reunion with his ex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My character is really thinking, &amp;lsquo;How can I work with him again?&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awkward,&amp;rdquo; Fox said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s uncomfortable and messy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by the end of the episode, the two discover that they are still in love with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said Fox: &amp;ldquo;I always knew I was part of this weird love story. For all the violence and darkness in the show, there&amp;rsquo;s still this love story, and that&amp;rsquo;s such a terrific way to end up. No matter how black things seem, &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; is a love story; there is long and lasting love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple is seen at the end literally riding off into the sunset, where Grissom has relocated. But there&amp;rsquo;s still the matter of Sidle&amp;rsquo;s job in Las Vegas, where she&amp;rsquo;s been promoted to the head of the CSI unit. The future of Grissom and Sidle is still a mystery as the credits close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On one hand, maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll just ride around in the boat for an hour and then call it quits,&amp;rdquo; Fox said with a chuckle. &amp;ldquo;Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll stay together and become CSIs for the ocean and the environment. There&amp;rsquo;s no talk of a spinoff, but that would make a great idea for a show.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Fox is looking forward to the next chapter of her life and career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s next,&amp;rdquo; Fox said. &amp;ldquo;In some ways, the end of the show caught me by surprise. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time in 19 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been between jobs. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to decompress a little bit. It&amp;rsquo;s been nice just hanging out with my dog and just letting go. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the next thing is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the end, &amp;lsquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo; died as it lived: fun, flabby, and altogether too invested in the undying love of two deeply sexless characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Petersen&amp;rsquo;s return for the series finale gave the show a badly needed jolt of original &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; magic, it also meant that the love story of Gil Grissom and Sara Sidle returned to center stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, was another of the show&amp;rsquo;s originating characters. She initially was Grissom&amp;rsquo;s subordinate but eventually became friend, lover, wife, estranged wife, ex-wife &amp;#8212; in the most uninteresting ways possible. Fox and Petersen always existed within the show&amp;rsquo;s universe without an ounce of chemistry, so when the series opted to make the two its &amp;lsquo;one true pairing,&amp;rsquo; it went all in on the show&amp;rsquo;s least interesting relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there was plenty of Grissom-and-Sidle relationship drama in the finale, as we quickly learn that the two have divorced and it becomes clear, when Grissom returns to Las Vegas to help investigate a string of suicide bombings, that they are still in love with each other. It&amp;rsquo;s this misguided commitment to its own worst tendencies that made &amp;lsquo;Immortality, Parts 1 and 2&amp;rsquo; such a fitting sendoff for &amp;lsquo;CSI.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the show finally had the luminous Helgenberger back as Catherine Willows, it trapped her in a one-dimensional storyline that underlined how the series only knew how to view the character through the fact that she was a mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse than the investment in Grissom and Sidle is the fact that the show brought back Lady Heather, a popular recurring character, played by Melinda Clarke, who had a deep and complex relationship with Grissom, who, despite having the entire plot seemingly revolve around her, functions only as a red herring, only useful to drive Sidle and Grissom back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most egregious misstep the finale makes is in its conclusion when, after finally taking over as CSI director, Sidle leaves the career she&amp;rsquo;s built to wander around the oceans with Grissom. True love is one thing; it&amp;rsquo;s two people meeting in the middle and each giving ground so they can find a place where they can each thrive. But that&amp;rsquo;s not what &amp;lsquo;CSI&amp;rsquo; does. It breaks Sara&amp;rsquo;s back and sends her on her way, and the implication is clear: If her relationship only works by following Grissom to the ends of the Earth, then her true calling is following Grissom to the ends of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird and contrary message, the opposite of what love is, and, in a way, the perfect summation of a relationship that never really worked. Sidle and Grissom sail off into the sunset, something the show believes is a happy ending but reality makes less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
