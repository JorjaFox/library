<p>Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Paul Guilfoyle (Jim Brass) and Robert David Hall (Dr. Al &lsquo;David&rsquo; Robbins) were on Ri:se, Channel 4(UK) to promote the season 1 DVD. There was a clip of Season 1 stuff with a voice over and lots of Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown) clips. Then they showed an interview of Jorja in one hotel room Paul and Robert in another, interspersed with clips form various episodes. There was mention of CSI&rsquo;s ratings success in the US and also for the UK&rsquo;s Channel 5, and a way too enthusiastic commentary from the presenters about the TMI cam for a breakfast show. Also blah blah Jorja Fox is aptly named, she was Maggie Doyle form ER.</p>

<p>Following is a vague transcript of what they said, seeing as viewers only got the answers not the questions.</p>

<h2 id="transcript:1f5835e2a4d9a75d3cc25a0f5181c803">Transcript</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I think everyone can sympathise with the show. There&rsquo;s something slightly off about it.</p>

<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Science can&rsquo;t be sexy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> If people say the show is sexy that&rsquo;s a compliment. As there is no sex in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert and Jorja talked about how all the actors they know want to be on the show as bodies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul and Jorja talked about the Bill Clinton wants to be on the show rumour. Paul debunked it, saying it was one comment that got out of control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was this weird tribute montage where they got the actors to pretend that what was in front of them (they were all seated in front of tables) was a crime scene and comment appropriately in character.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Robert:</strong> I would say something profound and multisyllabic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He also went on about how he&rsquo;d slice (a non-existant body) and weigh the organs. Paul only said just don&rsquo;t touch the evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jorja who was on her own, got really into making up a story about the objects in front of her and how imaginary clues would help her. Apparently some Colgate toothpaste was the key&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the CSI Season One special edition DVD will be released in the UK on July the first.</p>

		<p><strong>LARRY KING, HOST:</strong> Tonight, unsolved mysteries, Jon Bonet Ramsey, Chandra Levy &#8212; in the news. No wonder one of TV&rsquo;s top drama&rsquo;s is &ldquo;CSI Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;. This phenomenal series is about following evidence and closing cases. Glory details, high tech twists, it got them all.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> But, how realistic are the corpses and the clues?<br />
Joining us from LA, stars from the gripping show, killing the competition, and from Detroit, world renowned forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee, with insights on &ldquo;CSI&rsquo;s&rdquo; accuracy and high profile real life crimes, and it&rsquo;s all next on LARRY KING WEEKEND. &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; has been extraordinarily popular, and surprising hit on CBS every Thursday night at 9:00. What a cast, and what an idea. The concept is &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; and the cast joins us, William PETERSEN who plays Gil Grissom, the Senior Forensic Officer heading the team Criminalistics Bureau in Los Vegas. Marg Helgenberger plays Catherine Willows, she&rsquo;s a top member of that team, also a single mom and a former stripper &#8212; cover every angle. Jorja Fox plays Sara Sidle; Sara is an intensely focused member of the team; sometimes seems that work is her whole life. Gary Dourdan &#8212; Dourdan, rather, plays Warrick Brown on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, Warrick&rsquo;s another member of the team of criminalistics, he&rsquo;s highly competitive, he&rsquo;s a talented jazz musician, and has had a gambling problem. This is covering every base known to man. And Elizabeth Devine, story editor and technical consultant for &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, veteran criminalist, worked 15 years in the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, has a BA in Biology and a Master&rsquo;s in criminalistics, and in Detroit, a frequent guest on this program, Dr. Henry Lee, the world renowned forensic expert, the Chief emeritus for Scientific Services, and the former Commissioner of Public Safety for the state of Connecticut, his new book is &ldquo;Cracking Cases, the Science of Solving Crimes.&rdquo; Elizabeth, were you involved in this, from the get go?</p>

<p><strong>ELIZABETH DEVINE, STORY EDITOR AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANT, CSI:</strong> Yes, not with the pilot, but I&rsquo;ve been involved with every single show.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> How&rsquo;d they get you involved William?</p>

<p><strong>WILLIAM PETERSEN, ACTOR, CSI:</strong> Well, Anthony Zukier, who came up with the idea, pitched me the story and I just fell for it, big time.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You liked it right away.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Marg?</p>

<p><strong>MARG HELGENBERGER, ACTRESS, CSI:</strong> It was a pilot script that my agent tipped me off too, a couple years ago and said, &ldquo;This is the one to go after, if you want &#8212; if you&rsquo;re interested&rdquo;, and I, you know, read it immediately and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&rdquo;, and I just &#8212; I had a really strong feeling about this show.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You did, so did William. What about you Gary?</p>

<p><strong>GARY DOURDAN, ACTOR, CSI:</strong> A &#8212; Billy gave me the job.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Billy is William.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We &#8212; they call you Billy?</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Les Moonev, William Petersen, Anthony Zukier, they had a lot to do with me, getting the gig, fantastic reading, fantastic script, easily to get involved with, right away.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You like it right away?</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Right away.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Jorja?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA FOX, ACTRESS, CSI:</strong> Actually I joined the show, when Liz joined the show in episode one, I was, sort of, a last minute cast edition to the show, and I came mesmerized also, completely &#8212; it&rsquo;s like a trance, I think that a lot of us go under and &#8212; yes, so, I joined the show late, my typical standards.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Dr. Lee, what is a criminal list?</p>

<p><strong>HENRY LEE, FORENSIC EXPERT:</strong> A criminal is a person working laboratory, crime laboratory, or police department, search the crime scene, examine the physical evidence, but all the criminal goes to the crime scene. Some just work in the laboratory examine the evidence. Other does the crime scene analysis, not like their &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, they dust the crime scene, or so examine the evidence.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Is this called forensics?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Forensic, yes, this is part of forensic. Forensic is a really major area, they have so many specialty areas, such as the forensic medicine; dealing with live patients, forensic pathology does the autopsy, forensic old um college, deal with the dental evidence &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Does every big police department have criminalists.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, big departments, every state will have a crime laboratory.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> What we&rsquo;re going to do now is just show you a scene from one of the &ldquo;CSI&rsquo;s&rdquo; to give you a little framework here, and then we&rsquo;re going to delve into lots of aspects, so watch.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Bill Petersen, how much did you get to learn about your &#8212; about this craft from play it?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> The great thing about the show is, we learn everyday.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You do.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Absolutely. It&rsquo;s really one of the reasons that I wanted to do it, quite frankly. I was always terrified that if I got on television that I did a role, that I would be doing the same thing everyday, possibly for years, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to grow, or to learn anything. This provided the opportunity to learn something everyday.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Your character is very intense, is he not?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Would you describe him as?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes, I think he&rsquo;s in love with his work, and he puts that probably most above everything.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Marg, how do you see your person you play?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Unlike Billy&rsquo;s character who is an entomologist, in addition to being a criminalist, I came to this career through another path. And I just think that, the path that she took is, kind of, interesting, and that&rsquo; the thing of the exotic dancer. But I&rsquo;ve learned an enormous amount of &#8212; about criminalist terminology, forensic science, since starting this show, and as Billy said, every day we learn something new &#8212; and all the words are spelled out phonetically for us. And Liz is standing by to give us the definition of what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> By the way Liz, is everything on the show correct, or do they take literary license.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Well, we have to do some literary license, we do &#8212; speed things up for television, but everything scientifically we try to keep as accurate as possible and do a lot of research and try to help our actors know that what they&rsquo;re saying is the real thing.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Do criminalists solve crimes?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> I think criminalists play a huge part in solving crimes, and juries expect forensics now, and you really can&rsquo;t solve a crime without forensic science these days.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Gary, how do you approach Warrick?</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> I think I liken my character to Marg&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a certain street life sensibility, sort of, informedness , being out on the field.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> What attracts him to this work?</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Well, I think that&rsquo;s the two parts of the scientific part of it, and also the laymen&rsquo;s part of it. It almost a detective, kind of, figuring things out by a hunch and backing it up by science.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> But you&rsquo;re around a lot of gory things here.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Jorja, how do you see Sara?</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Sara is very intense. She might be a little excessive compulsive; she has a great amount of patience with focus and detail. I think it&rsquo;s funny, because Michelle , we learn so much everyday on the show, but so much of it goes into my short-term memory, because something that I&rsquo;m memorizing for acting and I wish I retained more. I come to loose all the highlights. What was that thing we did two months ago, that I forgot to &#8212; I answered it out so I could learn that new thing.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;ll talk about why their show&rsquo;s a hit, other things they do, as we wend our way through &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, the end of a season of extraordinary success, don&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;re back with the cast of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, and we want all of your opinions on this, why is it a hit William? No one forecasted it, it was supposed to be the fugitive right, the big CBS hit.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I believe CBS thought the &#8212; it would be the fugitive &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> They did not think &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; would be a hit, I mean they were happy of course.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I&rsquo;m sure not, but &#8212; I don&rsquo;t know, I always thought it was going to be a hit because &#8212; I did a movie several years ago, called &ldquo;Man Hunter&rdquo;, which was based on a Thomas Harris &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Hannibal Lector&rsquo;s first introduction to us.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> And people, for years, had been talking about &#8212; to me about that, and about that and, you know, the science that goes into finding these people and in that case it was profiling, criminal profiling, which is very different than what we&rsquo;re doing. But, I just knew that there was a &#8212; especially since the O.J. trial, there was this language out there, that I&rsquo;m not sure that the public was versed in, but they knew what exactly was &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> That&rsquo;s correct, so wouldn&rsquo;t you have bet then, it would have been hard then to be a hit when you&rsquo;re saying a lot of words, we don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Well, I think what we want to know is what are they talking about? And so I think, people watch our show on the edge of their sofa&rsquo;s as opposed to lounging at that .</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Marg, why do you think it&rsquo;s a hit?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s a hit for many reasons. I think that foremost, I think that it&rsquo;s a great mystery, and I think that mysteries will always be successful, because people are always intrigued by them.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> The use of the special affects, which actually help people understand the science. I think that&rsquo;s why school children and teenage kids are so compelled by the show and they are inspires to become criminalists, because of the way we utilize the science.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You think you inspire people to &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> I know, I have. I&rsquo;ve had teenagers come to me, or parents of teenagers come up to me and say, &ldquo;My child is changed or I&rsquo;m changing what I want to do for the rest of my life&rdquo;, or whatever, what does an 18 &#8212; 17 year old know for &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Gary, why do you think the public has responded?</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> I would echo, just what they&rsquo;ve said, I think that, I&rsquo;ve said it before that this is an information age, we have a lot of shows that are going into discoveries of nature, and I think this is a great timing for it. And I think that it&rsquo;s never going to go anywhere, we had Sherlock Holmes that&rsquo;s still very available and accessible.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And it&rsquo;s still though Jorja, it has to be a good story, right? To get all the rest, you have to have who, what, where, when, why.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> The writers and research department, and our technical advisors, I think every weekend end it , to make a plot suspenseful. I think of our show as an actual adventure show, and even though there&rsquo;s not a lot of car chases or things like, there&rsquo;s a pacing where people, there&rsquo;s a suspense that people are, kind of, wondering what happened. And I think we&rsquo;re also really lucky that we&rsquo;re on the cutting edge of this technology, and things are happening everyday, stuff is coming out that will allow us to have new tricks coming out of our pockets for a long time .</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And now a key moment in the show, Dr. Lee; what do you think of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is an excellent show. As a matter of fact, many detectives also watch, today I was selected to allow the detective from Detroit Michigan, even some from Hawaii, to attend a practical homicide-training seminar. I did a survey and asked them, &ldquo;How many of you watching CSI?&rdquo; It was surprising to me, almost the majority of the class. So, they did like the show, but sometime they say, little bit far from reality.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> What do you say?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> One of the detective will tell, he got into a lot of troubles, and the chief went out and bought a license for him, and he went to couple crime scenes and not found any evidence, the chief started yelling at him, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; detective want all of those evidence. We spent so much money and bought you this license . What did you do with that? Interesting show, the people liked it because after O.J. Simpson, Jon Bonet Ramsey, Vincent Foster case, the public dying for the reality show. This case, of course, it&rsquo;s more in reality sense, compared to many other police show, because many time, you know, by second commercial, you guys already found the clue. We have to work years, years, before we found any lead.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And that&rsquo;s as Elizabeth said, right, you have to speed the process up.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes. I really think Bill and Jorja say something really profound, very good, say everyday learn something, and I be in this business 45 years now, everyday I&rsquo;m still learning. Like every time, lectured to the detective, the day you start, feel you know everything, that&rsquo;s the time you should retire.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Those are &#8212; take real life stories, right Marg, stories that happened in real life and translate, as &ldquo;Law &amp; Order&rdquo; does.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You did the one with the homeless, right, person in there, right, and the killing by the women in the car in the windshield. So, you will take stories out of the newspaper and transform them into a fictionalized hour.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Absolutely, and true things that people do to each other are much more interesting than anything we could think up, so.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> We have real stories that have happened out there, that our writers will go, we&rsquo;ll never be able to do that, they&rsquo;ll think we made this up.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Have all of you been to a morgue.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Have you looked at like, dead bodies. I mean have you had to do this?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;ve looked at dead bodies.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> I&rsquo;ve only seen one dead body in a morgue, and it was not intact, in other words it was a &#8212; it was a heart attack victim.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> I see, have you seen &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I have not been through an &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Autopsy. Anybody. How about some of the scenes where you have to portray like you&rsquo;re looking at, is that hard?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I think our makeup people and the actors that come to play our dead people are amazing.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> They&rsquo;re a dead beat.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> They&rsquo;re amazing. We&rsquo;ll do a scene &#8212; we will be doing a scene and the coroner&rsquo;s lab and the actor will be on the slab for an hour while we setup the lights and do all of that stuff, we&rsquo;ll forget that the person, is an actual living person.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Well, you know, we get asked that question a lot, about is it gory for you all? But &#8212; first &#8212; these actors are all made up as corpses, but then they&rsquo;ll like poke their head in and they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Hey, you guys where&rsquo;s craft service?&rdquo;, you know, so it just breaks the illusion, but when you actually see it on air, or a tape of the program, I&rsquo;m sometimes, it&rsquo;s like too intense for me. So, it&rsquo;s when you in the moment, it doesn&rsquo;t really phase you, and I imagine it might be something when you&rsquo;re actually working, and you don&rsquo;t have time to think about it, but when you see it after the fact, it&rsquo;s &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;ll take a break and be back with lots more about &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Dr. Lee, how realistic is the realism.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Well, its pretty real, and of course, just talking, you guys talk about a morgue, autopsy &#8212; day before yesterday I was in Detroit with Dr. Wack , we went to the autopsy room to dissecting some bodies, just look at it, you know, nobody enjoy to see others misfortune. But, on the other hand, we can&rsquo;t stop to feel sympathize to the victim or so the smell of the morgue, the death, it&rsquo;s kind of relapse thing . I still remember the first homicide, when 40 some years ago, is a dismembering case, after work on that case for months, I don&rsquo;t like to eat meat. I almost become a vegetarian. Reality and the show, of course, is still a little bit apart, but the reality usually it&rsquo;s a teamwork. We need more people, we have the first police officer detective, laboratory scientist, medical examiner, district attorney, everybody have to work together, so important.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> From what this case, wouldn&rsquo;t you say that the Ramsey case was a classic example of poor criminalist work at the scene?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Yes, I&rsquo;m not sure they had criminalists at the scene.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, they do, they did have some Sheriff Department, forensic people on border police department and detective dust the crime scene.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s a lot different to do &#8212; what did they have no murders, a couple of murders in three years versus, you know what we say in LA county, where our criminalists do go into the crime scenes, collect the evidence, come back and analyze it, and you can only get good at that, the more you do it. So, it&rsquo;s skill takes repetitiveness and going out to the crime scenes a lot and I think there were some problems, definitely problems with that case.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> When you have to work together, but the many laboratory criminals doesn&rsquo;t go to the scene. Many time the detective goes to the scene, however they don&rsquo;t training in CSI .</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> That&rsquo;s what I question when I watch the show sometimes; do criminalists &#8212; are always go to the scene? Do you know?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> It depends on the jurisdiction, it depends on the department.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> It also depends on whether they are qualified to go to the scene. They&rsquo;re in different stages of their development.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Now, how do you approach it as an actor, when you come to the scene, how do you see &#8212; your role is what there? It&rsquo;s a mystery to you, right?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Well, its &#8212; we all know the scripts in advance, we&rsquo;ve read the whole thing. So, the goal as an actor, is to try and make sure we don&rsquo;t get ahead of what we know, of what the character knows. So, the character has to play the mystery. The actor knows what&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You might shoot a last scene first, depending on what&rsquo;s set up that day right?</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> You can shoot a show in the morning, and start a new show in the afternoon, and so &#8212; I think that&rsquo;s really keeping the scenes together, in your head, and knowing where you&rsquo;re coming from and where you&rsquo;re supposed to be going, what stage of the case are you in, and that can get a little &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> It can drive you nuts?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> It can drive you a little crazy, especially if there&rsquo;s script changes on a &#8212; from a scene to scene basis, which happens from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> When you watch the finished show then, are you often surprised?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Oh, always surprised, because there&rsquo;s many things that we are not at all involved with. All the special effects, that&rsquo;s all done in a computer graphics place called Stargate , and some of the things they come up with are ingenious, and it&rsquo;s so amusing sometimes. That&rsquo;s where a lot of the black humor comes in.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Are you involved in the editing Elizabeth? Are you in that room?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Very infrequently, sometimes I&rsquo;m there.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> So therefore, you&rsquo;re surprised too, when you watch it.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> I sometimes am. I &#8212; often they bring me in just to look at the way they set up a special affect, for instance when you go into the body, that we&rsquo;re going past the right organs and it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re not breaking a rib, when we&rsquo;re supposed to be breaking a knee cap, you know, that sort of thing. But, most of the time they do it on their own, and they&rsquo;re really very talented.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Dr. Lee, is a lot of this work, team work?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, there a lot of team work in real crime laboratory, also a lot of teamwork. However, many time we don&rsquo;t produce result in second commercial, that&rsquo;s one big problem. The public really enjoy the shows and got a lot of phone calls saying &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; people can do it and why don&rsquo;t you guys do it. That&rsquo;s kind of put us in a little bit difficulty, I like to invite the cast to Connecticut to see our laboratory or also University of New Haven , we have the Institute of Forensic Science. If any of you interested to come, you are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Wow, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> That&rsquo;s very nice.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> We&rsquo;ll be there.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Write a script where there&rsquo;s a certain crime in Connecticut and you can&rsquo;t solve it. Dr. Lee could be in it, and he calls on the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; team from Vegas. You&rsquo;ve got the whole thing worked out. We&rsquo;ll be right back with more, we&rsquo;ll reintroduce our guests too, don&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> It has become an extraordinary success story, in television. In fact, Mr. PETERSEN, just asked if it had been renewed, and was just informed, it has been renewed, thus of course Mr. Moones has completely lost his marbles. The guests are William PETERSEN, who plays Gil Grissom on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, the Senior Forensic Officer, one of the show&rsquo;s producer&rsquo;s as well, Marg Helgenberger, one of the 50 most beautiful people in the &#8212; on the planet, according to &ldquo;People Magazine&rdquo;, also known for her Emmy winning role on &ldquo;China Beach&rdquo;, and she plays Catherine Willows, Jorja Fox plays Sara Sidle, the intensely focused member of the criminalist team, she was a murder victim in the cult hit &ldquo;Memento&rdquo;, Gary Dourdan &#8212; Gary Dourdan is Warrick Brown on CSI, he was also credited with appearances on &ldquo;Swift Justices&rdquo; and &ldquo;New York Undercover&rdquo;, and he is another member of the criminalist team, Elizabeth Devine, the story editor and technical consultant for &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, and a veteran criminalist herself.<br />
And Dr. Henry Lee is the world renowned forensic expert, he&rsquo;s in Detroit, and he&rsquo;s the author of the book &ldquo;Cracking Cases, the Science of Solving Crimes.&rdquo;<br />
One of the things about the speed of it, do you think Bill , there&rsquo;s some danger when you have the answer on the DNA in two and a half minutes? And it might take two and a half months.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> And in some cases, it can take up to six months because, for instance on our show, our lab work, we have everything we need.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> You have all the equipment you could possibly have. There&rsquo;s labs across the country that don&rsquo;t have much of the stuff that we have. One of the problems in solving crimes today is, having the funding.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Well, do you think the public, Elizabeth, then wants answers right away? You see a drought &#8212; was isn&rsquo;t it over in two days?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> I think there is that possibility, but I also think that trained for most, which the people who do this are used to testimony, and they&rsquo;re used to telling &#8212; I&rsquo;m used to telling jury&rsquo;s that, &ldquo;Hey that&rsquo;s television and this is real.&rdquo; But, we also have a job to do on the show, and that&rsquo;s to further the story and the only way to do that is not to wait six months for DNA, we&rsquo;re going to have to get it quickly, so that we can move on with the story. So, we do take that sheet , and it&rsquo;s just something that we do.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Jorja, what do you think drives the character? I know you&rsquo;ve had a personal &#8212; a friend of yours lost someone very close to her, right, a mother?</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Yes, and I think all of us at some point have had a very personal experience with death. You know, as we were talking before, the stories that are true on the show, you always want to tell them with the most dignity that you can. You know it&rsquo;s a TV show, but, you know, please &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> So, the people you are playing, they don&rsquo;t make a lot of money.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Pardon me?</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> They don&rsquo;t make a lot of money, these people.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> No, there &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> What do you think drives them?</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> They&rsquo;re nuts, I think they&rsquo;re all typically very, very smart people, that are very good at something a lot of people can&rsquo;t even comprehend, and I think that, that kind of drive keeps them at what they do. I know there&rsquo;s a very high burn out rate actually with criminalists.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> I would guess. What do you think Marg?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Why they like to do what they do. I think they have a knack for it, I think that they, I think most of them would tend to be &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> A little Sherlock Holmes-ish .</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> And meticulous, and they have an eye for detail, and are keen obervationists and I think ultimately, they all are detectives in their heart, they&rsquo;re detectives.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> There&rsquo;s also a certain amount of heroism to what they do, I mean these &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> But, they don&rsquo;t get the headlines.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> No, they don&rsquo;t. But, for them, to be able to &#8212; I remember being in Vegas when one of the &ldquo;CSI&rsquo;s&rdquo; had spent two weeks combing a car for fingerprints, and abandoned vehicle that had been stolen, and finally tape lifted a partial thumb print, and he was just &#8212; it was the most unbelievable, he was just lit up, from having finally been able to pull something that may or may not be able to get this thing done. And I mean &#8212; I think that they&rsquo;re, I think that they&rsquo;re heroes as well. I think that they also bring closure to an awful lot of people when there&rsquo;s seeming no closure available.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Well, if they get to tell the family member, here&rsquo;s what happened, here&rsquo;s why it happened.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And often solve it.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s a good time, because it&rsquo;s the unsung hero, it&rsquo;s great to have Dr. Lee on the show, it&rsquo;s great to bring these criminalists out into the forefront.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Elizabeth, do the ever not get the bad guy on the show?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Yes, one of the things that I try to strive for, is that we don&rsquo;t always figure it out, we don&rsquo;t always &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> As &ldquo;Law &amp; Order&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t want to win them all.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> But, we win most of them, our audience wants us to solve the crimes, but we have a few that were unsolved. Gary did one, that basically going in, he knew he was not going to solve, and sometimes you have those, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean you work any less hard, but there are cases that you&rsquo;re not going to ever solve.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> We had an episode early in the year that we all worked on this case, and it turned out at the end of the case, that it was an accident. And we had calls from everywhere going, &ldquo;What do you mean it was an accident. No, somebody had to do it, we want somebody to have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Dr. Lee, is there the perfect crime?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Well, in theory, shouldn&rsquo;t, and we unfortunately many times because they not found physical evidence, also no witnesses, like we often talk about solving crimes, just like a building a four legged table. You need a good crime scene. You need good physical evidence, detected through work on clue, found witnesses, the last one, little luck, we need luck. And if you don&rsquo;t have that, like the Jon Bonet Ramsey case, we don&rsquo;t have the for scenes that&rsquo;s why case still unsolved.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Might that case never be solved.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Well, we still, people still working on it. If we have some new development in size or some witness come along, or maybe little lucky, a case may be solved. Of course, you know, people always talk about perfect crime, in reality, we work everyday. I can really appreciate a good comment about criminalists, because criminalists, forensic scientist, it&rsquo;s not a job, it&rsquo;s a profession. We have to devote &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> You never give up. You told me once, you were looking at cases from 20 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, as a matter of fact, this week as you know, you guys &#8212; you will cover that, Skakel case, happened 26 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And you testified in that case.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And you said that the state prosecutors have no direct scientific evidence linking fingerprints or DNA to Skakel.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, but we have some indirect evidence, no direct evidence.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;ll take a break and be back with lots more about &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;re back with the cast of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. You worked on the Menendez case?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Very small part yes, I actually processed both defendants when they were suspected of trying to escape from their prelim, I had to look for metal shavings on them, and I looked at the evidence from the crime scene for possible reconstruction, which was not possible.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> And it took all this time Marg, and they finally discovered in the Danielle van Dam case that she was suffocated. That was the means of death. It took all this time to find that out.</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Right, I mean the little &#8212; I haven&rsquo;t been following the case closely, but I know the body been quite decomposed, it had decomposed quite a bit, and they said that was part of the reason of the hold up. Am I right Liz, about that?</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> How they, how they do it, is just amazing. Yes, you would think that everything&rsquo;s hopeless.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes, you can&rsquo;t, you would never be able to figure out anything from this.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> But you can figure out things, I&rsquo;m reading the book &#8212; bringing the book Michael Connelly, &ldquo;City of Bones.&rdquo; They find bones from a child, 30 years ago, and they can investigate off bones. They can find method of death off of bones.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Yes, they can.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes, it&rsquo;s amazing isn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s scary.</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Well, not every bone.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Dr. Lee, one wonders, why weren&rsquo;t you a normal doctor, Park Avenue, $700,000 a year, what are you need dead bodies?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Well, I start my career as a police officer, a detective, as a matter of fact, as a captain in charge detective, 40 some years ago. Then, I become a scientist, and then of course, not have my mother want me to become a regular MD, make a lot of money, but let me tell you Larry &#8212; when I was in high school, I want to become a basketball player. When the coach looked at me 5 8&#8243; he says, you grow another two feet and come back to see me. Then I realized, I can&rsquo;t be a basketball player &#8212; but I&rsquo;m really interesting in solving crime &#8212; I&rsquo;m so happy I&rsquo;ve become a forensic scientist.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Is it hard William dealing with scripts where people do terrible things to other people.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Can we move around on this, I asked William, are you around, you see the worst.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes, and you can&rsquo;t believe, we&rsquo;re somewhat inured to all of that. I mean yes, you see it a little bit on the news, you see the newspaper, you hear about things, but when we do these case, and we &#8212; you know, this actually happened, they actually did this. It just makes you, you know, you just want are never sure what to wonder about humanity.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Doctor, you ever get used to coming upon a horrendous scene. You ever get used to that?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, everyday. Sometime we go to the crime scene, three, four, times a day. When the victim&rsquo;s family need help, because they usually turn to the police officer, detective, forensic scientist. We&rsquo;re their last hope.</p>

<p>Like, I receive letter almost everyday, sometime <sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>40</sub> letters a day, phone calls &#8212; just other day a mother and call me and say her daughter disappear 40 some years ago, and she run out of all the resources, can I help out. Many time, they say their daughter been murdered, husband been murdered, so forensic scientist, you know sometime we hear a lot of sad story.</p>

<p>Of course, when the case solved, when the family thank us, writing a letter, it&rsquo;s not really say, you can gain in financially, this a group of good people working day and night, helping society.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Are there any people Lee , who you run into who believe you are what you play?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I was in the grocery store the other day, and this gal was behind me in line, and she all of sudden recognized me and went, &ldquo;Grissom, it&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s Grissom.&rdquo;, and I said, &ldquo;Not today, it&rsquo;s Saturday&rdquo;, so I was off.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> I was actually, we were shooting in Vegas, and I went up to Reno on one of my days off, an actual forensic detective came up to me and starting talking for about an hour.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Marg, happen to you yet?</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Do I get confused with my character? Somewhat, but I have to &#8212; the other thing that &#8212; something happened to me the other day, in a airport, I was paying for a newspaper, and this gentleman said to me, &ldquo;I love your show, whoever writes it has got a sick mind, and you can tell them I said that.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going &#8212; one hand he loves it, but then he&rsquo;s like repulsed by it, I think part of the provocative nature of our show &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Jorja, do you think people think it&rsquo;s sick?</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Sick?</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Sick, weird.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> Yes, they probably do.</p>

<p><em>(VIDEO CLIP)</em></p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Put it mildly, you have a weird job.</p>

<p><strong>FOX:</strong> So to speak, the black sheep.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We&rsquo;ll be back with our remaining moments with PETERSEN, Helgenberger, Fox, Dourdan, Devine, and LEE, sounds like a law firm. Don&rsquo;t go away.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Is it true that you get better equipment for the show, than real CSI people get?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> That&rsquo;s the truth, some crime labs &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Did the company send it to you?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> We see equipment, it&rsquo;s real equipment.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Oh, yes. Everything we use is real. There are a lot of crime labs in CSI&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;t have access to it, but everything we use &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> That&rsquo;s not some set builder.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Oh, no.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Sometimes it&rsquo;s not actually a prop.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> If you tell me this is a macrobiotic transformer, it is.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I ask these guys around the country, and they&rsquo;ll go, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you have the mass spectrometer, you know, all that stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Are you envious sometimes, Dr. Lee?</p>

<p><strong>LEE:</strong> Yes, I heard most of your comment. We&rsquo;re lucky, but most of time the crunch many piece of equipment you can&rsquo;t bring to the crime scene. Crime scene is one process, laboratory is another.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Laboratories are sexy and kinky though too, you know.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(VIDEO CLIP)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> Yes, sex does play a part.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> As it does in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>DOURDAN:</strong> Plus it also does in murders a lot. You know &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>HELGENBERGER:</strong> I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Is this show moving to Miami, or it&rsquo;s going to be a new show in Miami.</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> This show is not moving, we&rsquo;re happily staying in Vegas, but there is another show, it&rsquo;s going to be in Miami.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Called &ldquo;CSI Miami&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Same producer, are you involved in that Bill ?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Can they take the name like that?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Well &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Is it CBS?</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Yes, CBS is doing it and some of our people are helping them do it, and it &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> So, it&rsquo;s not going to be a rival show.</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> I really don&rsquo;t &#8212; no &#8212; well, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Well you&rsquo;re &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s going to be &ldquo;CSI Miami&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>DEVINE:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Uh oh, this is going to be who wants to be a millionaire. We&rsquo;re going to have &ldquo;CSI Boston&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re going to have &ldquo;CSI &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PETERSEN:</strong> Larry, it&rsquo;s always been the maxim in Hollywood, that that&rsquo;s work making is worth remaking. Anything that was good once, could be good twice.</p>

<p><strong>KING:</strong> Imitation is a serious form of flattery. Hope you all take Dr. Lee up in his offer, to come out there. Dr. Lee, thank you as always for joining us, and we thank Elizabeth, and Gary, and Georgia, and Marg, and William, the shoe is &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, it airs Thursday nights at 9:00, focuses on the team of forensic investigators working on the overnight shift of the Criminalistics Bureau in Los Vegas. Thanks very much for joining us on this special edition of LARRY KING LIVE for our whole crew, and everybody else here in Los Angeles, good night.</p>

		<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong>: Although it now may seem hard to believe, it was just two years ago the hit drama &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; barely made it on to the primetime schedule. The show has since become a hit with an unusual look at forensic investigators who solve crimes with science.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> The stars of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; are William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, Jorja Fox and Paul Guilfoyle. Good morning, everybody.</p>

<p>(EVERYONE): Good morning, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Show of hands. Who thought this show was gonna be a hit? &ldquo;(Everyone but Jorja raises their hands.)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> It was the script. See, it was the material&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> A hit. We knew it was gonna be good, but I think that no one expected it.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna be, you know, 25, 28 million people watching.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We didn&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> &ldquo;(jokingly)&rdquo; And I think everything I do is gonna be a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s the one next to you &ldquo;(pointing to Jorja)&rdquo; that seems to be the good luck charm. I mean, regular on &ldquo;[[ER]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;[[The West Wing|West Wing]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; Sign you up in the making!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Thank you. I didn&rsquo;t think the show was gonna be a hit. I think I was the only one that didn&rsquo;t. I had so much hope and faith and so much belief in &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; but I really wasn&rsquo;t quite sure we were gonna stay on the air, but I was really happy&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Why not?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Well, I think it was a hard pitch at first for a lot of people. We were last to go at everything. Last to get picked up, like you said. And talking about death and science.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Hair fibers are a major element of the thing, and fingerprints. It was a question of how well we were gonna be able to translate that to the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, usually audiences are turned off by things that are about death, that are bloody, that are macabre. What are they responding to in this case?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Well, I think that the professionalism of the people. I think all drama is about people and interaction and I think they&rsquo;re really responding to all of us as a group. However we all cemented together is, I think, what people are responding to.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re all just working people, I mean, on the show and we operate in our jobs the way people go to work and operate in their jobs. We&rsquo;re very technical, very proficient, and I think it&rsquo;s interesting to watch the process. I think people enjoy watching the process of us put the science to the crime and solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But most of the time, people view people who are engaged with science as nerds. How are nerds turned into heroes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds. We just have better clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> I think also that the plot, that crime is the antagonist of our show. So, you watch this group of dedicated professionals try to come up against or conflict with the crime itself. So I think that&rsquo;s what takes it away from the nerd thing is because of what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> How much do you really know, any of you, about forensics?</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We&rsquo;re getting to know more and more everyday. I mean, I knew very little when we began.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I don&rsquo;t leave my fingerprints on anything.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> No, I do. I think about that all the time, whether or not I need to put on a pair of gloves or not.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Come on!</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> I do!</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Every couple of months, we get better and better, at least, at being able to use the tools and being able to know what the tools are used for. I&rsquo;m certain now if we came across a crime scene, we would at least know how to secure it.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Well, for instance, sometimes they&rsquo;ll do shots that don&rsquo;t include us, like tape-lifting prints from something and it would have been an added shot. And I saw this on an episode recently and my character was supposed to be doing it and I actually did it on the master. And then I saw the close-up and it was not my print. And it was so sloppy. And I felt like I wanna be doing my own inserts now because it was done&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna ask you, look, the show is fiction, but is the science [exact]? I mean, is that the one thing you never tamper with?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> The science is all real. The stuff we use is real, and the way we use it is all real.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I think some of the crimes are all real. They&rsquo;re based on real crimes. There&rsquo;s a lot of crime out there, unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> The process is sped up.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> You&rsquo;re never hurting for story lines.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Yeah, it is unfortunate. Talk to me about the collaborative effort of this. I mean, as I look at all of you, you&rsquo;ve all had individual achievements and have been primary players in something else. Is it something where you have to check your ego at the door of a show like this?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> I think that&rsquo;s the wise thing to do with all work. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a long day. It&rsquo;s a long day if you don&rsquo;t. And the great thing about this show, and I think in this case we&rsquo;re different than a lot of &ldquo;hit&rdquo; television shows in that our writers, our producers, our actors, our crew, even all the way to the network, we are very collaborative. It&rsquo;s not just one person&rsquo;s decision, as many hit television shows are. They come from one voice. We have a whole lot of people that work very hard all day long with each other to try and make this stuff work.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Do you get involved in the plot lines, the story lines? You&rsquo;re making a face there, Jorja. Yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. We do.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &#8216;Cause we&rsquo;re dedicated. So, I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes even for better for worse, I don&rsquo;t know if everybody always wants to hear from us, but they always act like they do. And they let us talk and they listen to us a lot, which is very kind of them.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And acting is kind of the detailed work, almost like the way forensics is and in the course of the process of creating a television show, the acting is kind of the final touchstone of reality, and so I think that&rsquo;s where we all have our own unique experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> In the final moments we&rsquo;ve got left the show is now going to have a spin-off. How uncomfortable are all of you with that?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> As actors, I think anytime something else comes along to try and compare to your stuff, you get a little queasy about it.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But you have the same people and they now have their attention split.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Here&rsquo;s the deal. It&rsquo;s a very successful show and the network is &hellip; and what &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; has done to television is a remarkable thing and I think that CBS is interested in some of that.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> That&rsquo;s a very provocative question, by the way, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> We&rsquo;ll have to pursue it during the commercial. Guys, thanks very much and congratulations.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Congratulations to you. Great job all these years.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Thanks, Bill. The season finale of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; airs tomorrow night at 9, of course, here on CBS. We&rsquo;re back in a moment, right after this.</p>

		<p>The character Sara is ten gazillion times more courageous than I am. You know, we do things sometimes and me, Jorja, in between takes is like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this, I can&rsquo;t do this. Let&rsquo;s make sure, we need to be careful, where&rsquo;s the medic?&rdquo; And then the camera&rsquo;s start rolling and Sara Sidle kinda just goes in and does it. We did a helicopter scene. This year George Eads and I had a scene where we were rappelling out of a helicopter.</p>

<p>The intent is not to be gratuitous. At the same time, because the show is so visual and we can go places with that, there&rsquo;s moments where we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology! So you want to have that opportunity if you can. Yeah, it shows up very heavily in the scripts. Sometimes the scripts are- I can&rsquo;t read the scripts late at night. I have to read them earlier in the day or I don&rsquo;t sleep very well.</p>

<p>I have so much respect and admiration for the folks who do this. You can show up every day and try and figure out what has happened. There&rsquo;s sort of that quote we have on the show, that we meet people on the worst day of their lives, and take things from there and try to provide, at the very least, some closure.</p>

<p>Sara Sidle is not squeamish. She&rsquo;s very cerebral, and she lives for what she does. And I think she can become emotional affected by what she&rsquo;s experiencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of her ability to be there, to be present.</p>

<h2 id="introduction:056bed86c85c27270cb0cb969b710445">Introduction</h2>

<p>[&hellip;] TV star Jorja Fox of &ldquo;Crime Scene Investigation: CSI&rdquo; talked about how she plays with her pooch while she has time between scenes. She also talked about her roles on &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;E/R.&rdquo; Jorja says her dream job would be appearing on TV on Animal Planet. Were the bosses listening that day?</p>

<h2 id="animal-planet-radio-10-min:056bed86c85c27270cb0cb969b710445">Animal Planet Radio - (10 min)</h2>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> We&rsquo;ll be right back with Jorja Fox on Animal Planet Radio!</p>

<p><strong>Theme to CSI: Who Are You?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You&rsquo;ve seen her on the West Wing and ER. Oh, remember that episode of Ellen? It was called the &#8216;Puppy&rsquo; Episode. We&rsquo;ll talk about that in a second. Her name is Jorja Fox, and right now she&rsquo;s the hottest thing on TV. Well no, I don&rsquo;t mean it quite that way. Well, you know, maybe I do. You see her on CSI and she&rsquo;s giggling. Hey, Jorja.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Hello, Steve. How&rsquo;s everything?</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Everything is great. You know, the reason why we wanted to have you on Animal Planet Radio was because I&rsquo;ve got, right in my hand here, your bio. And it says your name, you know, and then the date of birth, which is interesting cause the year is actually on this. I don&rsquo;t know any other actress that does that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> See, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how that all slipped out. But it&rsquo;s all out in the open.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> The place of birth, and then your pets.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No, it doesn&rsquo;t!</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> It does! Ali the dog, a boxer, Rumplestiltskin your cat, and Sidney Potier, your cat.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Well, we need to talk about this.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> I mean, you are a HUGE pet lover.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Um .. I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m an extreme animal lover now. And I love you know all animals. Domestic largely, but I&rsquo;m kind of an animal freak, I guess you could say.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Well, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a freaky thing, I think that&rsquo;s a great thing. Lets, you know I understand that between takes, I don&rsquo;t know many, you know, television scenes, exciting, and it kind of is, but you know, a lot of these shows especially those that are not sitcoms, they take a while. Yours is done in film style, movie style, and that means there&rsquo;s time between these takes.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Things have to be set up and especially with you show, because things are so specifically detailed.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Very visually oriented.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Mm hm. What do you do with all that time?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <strong>laughs</strong> That&rsquo;s a very good question. Well, we have all kinds of games on the set. Like chess and checkers and things like that. Match games like soccer and basketball break out. I have a big music collection in my trailer. And we&rsquo;re actually really lucky because we shoot a little outside of LA and we&rsquo;re allowed to bring our dogs to work.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Now &ldquo;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s&rdquo;&rsquo; where I&rsquo;m going.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. Yes, exactly, so.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> So the really big game isn&rsquo;t chess or checkers, it&rsquo;s fetch.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Mm hm. Yeah, Marg has a dog she brings sometimes. And George Eads brings his dog to work &ldquo;&lsquo;every&rdquo;&rsquo; day.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Ah, you&rsquo;re talking about Marg Helgenberger.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes, Marg Helgenberger is on the show.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> And?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> And George Eads. And his dog, Maverick, is there every day. If he&rsquo;s there, Maverick&rsquo;s there. And I bring my dog, I&rsquo;d say, you know about once every couple of weeks. I- I bring her if I have a shorter day. Because I have two cats, she has company at home. So unless- If I&rsquo;m there for a couple of hours or less, I have the time. If it gets to be a long day then <strong>laughs</strong> she&rsquo;s ready to come home, you know, before I am. That&rsquo;s a lot of fun, and it&rsquo;s a big gift too. That&rsquo;s not often, I mean you see that on some sets sometimes, but it&rsquo;s rare on a show that people are allowed to bring their pets.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Well, and those names of your pets intrigue me. Ali, named after the boxer?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Mm hm.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> All three of them, of my animals, came with their names. Sid Potier, actually was originally named Sid Vicious. And I quit calling him that, sort of altered that name, because he was inheriting his namesake a little bit, and I thought that maybe. And kind of the funny thing about that after he became Sid Potier, he did sort of relax. He&rsquo;s very debonair now.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> He&rsquo;s a much better actor.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> He&rsquo;s a perfect gentleman.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> And, ah, Ali was named after the great Muhammad Ali.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Mm hm.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Who, who was I to change their names? And I actually love all of their names.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Where did you get your dog, Ali, the Boxer, from?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Ah, um. Ali was a personal rescue, actually. I had a friend who couldn&rsquo;t keep her, and she was about ten months old. He had heard that I just moved out to LA and had a small yard and he called me and I said sure, that I would take her. She sort of came with an expiration date. That after six months, if I wasn&rsquo;t completely satisfied, that he was moving out to LA, and he would take her. And, ah, you know, of course, I fell madly in love. I think it took all of about a week. Ali was one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You know, they say that. And I used to do a lot of celebrity interviews, and I would talk, eventually, because I&rsquo;m me, with the celebrities, about their pets.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> And one of my favorite questions was-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Even before Animal Planet?</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Yeah! Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Which I&rsquo;m a huge fan of, by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Well, thank you! Thank you very much. Well I wanna know if your dog&rsquo;s personality, in any way, reflects yours?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Um <strong>laughs</strong> Well. People say that.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Definitely say that. And that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve been intrigued with for a long time too, cause I notice dogs, I think in particular, that are with owners or human companions, or whatever you want to call them, you know, the two personalities definitely seem to blend. The question to me has always been &#8216;has it been the dog the takes on the human personality, or the human takes on the dog personality.&rsquo; <strong>laughs</strong> And it&rsquo;s kind of a brilliant thing. But yeah, so I&rsquo;ve heard. I&rsquo;ve heard that we look alike, I&rsquo;ve heard that we have definitely similar personality traits.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Mm hm. Have you always been this huge animal lover?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, I mean, matter of fact, even as a kid, I grew up in a small, beach town in Florida, and there was more wildlife there than there probably were humans. At that time, things have changed, sort of a bit. My grandmother, who&rsquo;s 98, is a huge environmentalist, and has always been very, ah, very sort of tuned in to the natural world.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> And I think, as a young kid, I, um I really wanted to be like a marine biologist, or work with wildlife, more than I wanted to do anything else. And as I got older, you know, my science skills are really weak, which is also sort of iran- ironic cause I&rsquo;m playing a scientist <strong>laughs</strong> right now on television!</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Yeah, now you weren&rsquo;t supposed to tell me that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <strong>laughs</strong> Science and math. It sort of became clear to me, probably around Jr. High or High School, that I might not make it! You know? Like I would love to do it as a career, work with wildlife, but the actual mechanics of getting a degree might not really be in my future.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You know what would really be cool? And you never know who&rsquo;s listening to this show, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if you hosted a show on Animal Planet? Where you didn&rsquo;t have to really know the science?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> But you did have to use your ability, well you know, talk into that camera or that camera. And read off cue cards and do all the things that you can do. And- And and I don&rsquo;t mean that in a bad way! And still be able to go out and do things, like, with dolphin show trainers. And go to, maybe, a rain forest somewhere. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be great?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Steve, you know, if that could be in my future, I would be absolutely thrilled. That would be amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Okay! Let&rsquo;s say, alright, this is your- remember &#8216;I Dream of Jeanie&rsquo;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Mm hm.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Actually, I grew up ten minutes from the town where &#8216;I Dream of Jeanie&rsquo; took place, Coco Beach, Florida.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Alright, so you are now Jeanie. And you can cross your arms like Barbara Eden used to do, and close your eyes and, and all and make a wish for a TV Show. I mean, after CSI runs its very long and healthy course. Which we want.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <strong>laughs</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> What would that show be? Would it be a sitcom, would it be really a nature show?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Um yeah, I mean I would love to go out into the world, and sort of, you know, meet animals where they live and where they are naturally. I think that would be the all time greatest job. That was my hope, you know, even if it was being a wildlife photographer or that, where I could go to the places where animals are. That would be good.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You know, one thing I learned about this business: You say it, and it can happen. You do, you never know who&rsquo;s listening. But the first job, or one of the first times that we became familiar with you, Jorja Fox, was on &#8216;Ellen.&rsquo; They call that last show, and you&rsquo;ll have to explain something to me, and if it&rsquo;s filthy, don&rsquo;t explain it. Why is that last show refereed to, like on all the websites? As-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> As &#8216;The Puppy Episode.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I wish that I had a great answer to that question, and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to personally ask Ellen myself.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Is it something you can say on the radio, do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I, well, I don&rsquo;t even know the answer.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You have no idea.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> And I know that it is absolutely a term of endearment. That it&rsquo;s an inside joke, that there&rsquo;s an inside story to why it was called &#8216;The Puppy Episode.&rsquo; Obviously there&rsquo;s no puppies in that episode. And there&rsquo;s really, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any reference to any type of animals at all. But, ah, it&rsquo;s quite possibly, when Ellen was writing the show with the writers, you know, something that came, that was very personal to them, which you know at least that has in common with that episode. It was a show that was extremely personal to Ellen.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> I want to talk about CSI for a second. I mean, you are now probably being heard all over the nation, all over America, but I&rsquo;m from Chicago and there&rsquo;s a Chicago connection: William Petersen&rsquo;s on the show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes, he is.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> And he has something in common with you, because you have roots in the theater and so does he, I know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes. Absolutely. William Petersen is maybe one of my all time heroes. And, ah, he is from Chicago, he spent most of his break in Chicago. We&rsquo;ve just come off break. So we had six weeks to sort of go away and do whatever we wanted to do.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> You know, I&rsquo;ve referred to him as, ah, er, others have referred to him as an actor&rsquo;s actor. I don&rsquo;t know quite ever what that means. Maybe you can explain it to me.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <strong>loud laughter</strong> Oh, I think that&rsquo;s very specific right now, because he&rsquo;s producing [[CSI]] as well. So he&rsquo;s wearing two hats and, ah, as a producer, um, probably his number one concern, I think, that he looks after, is the actors on the show. And, um, he kind of once said to me that he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to work if it wasn&rsquo;t a collaborative process. Which is something that is extremely common, coming out of theater. If you work, you know, working on plays, two months of rehearsing, it becomes very much this collective of what people want to do. So that&rsquo;s how he works, and it&rsquo;s kind of unique to television, and um, everybody supported that. I think that they knew when they got William Petersen and he would be involved, that that&rsquo;s how the show would go. It&rsquo;s a very, very special thing.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Dale</strong> Well, CSI&rsquo;s become a very special thing, a very successful show. Wouldn&rsquo;t be that without you, Jorja Fox, thanks for sharing some time and talking about your best friends with four legs.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> <strong>laughs</strong> Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>Theme to CSI: Who Are You?</strong></p>
