		<p>**Pets In The City: **For many of us, the circus brings back fond memories of lions, tigers, and other large, beautiful creatures performing incredible acts of courage and agility usually with their tamers and trainers on board. But in recent years, the ability of some circuses to properly care for these large beasts has been under scrutiny. This scrutiny has not been limited to the United States. Joining us today is Jorja Fox, who plays the popular character Sara Sidle on the mega hit *CSI *Las Vegas, to talk about her personal work on behalf of some very special and now globe-trotting lions that she and other notable stars have helped move from Bolivia to the U.S. through their support of Animal Defenders International and their work on Operation: Lion Arc. Thanks so much for joining us today, Jorja.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh Diane, thank you so much for having me, I&rsquo;m really excited about this project.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> So give us a little bit of background; tell us what life is like as you know it from your involvement in this project- what life is like for a typical circus lion in Bolivia.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Uh&hellip; well, goodness, and that&rsquo;s a huge question, the organization ADI- Animal Defenders International- started an investigation, it was sort of a two-year undercover investigation, to the treatment and soft of the everyday life of circus animals throughout South America. And they found some really, really tough findings, you know, the animals are obviously kept in very small spaces, some of them are often malnourished, they were on the road all the time, the temperatures, as we know, can either be extremely hot, or extremely cold.</p>

<p>Their researches- it&rsquo;s pretty well-documented on their website- [inaudible] presented these findings to a bulk of counties in South America and they invited and soft of asked these nations if they could do better, and what could they do, and um, in a beautiful stroke of sort of, genius, a lot of the nations in South America responded lovingly and decided to ban circuses. So, this country that we&rsquo;re dealing with right now, Bolivia, has put in a full ban in set, uh, it was actually passed by their Congress- it&rsquo;s billed 40-40- and um, made traveling circuses and all circuses with large land mammals illegal. Uh, there&rsquo;s-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Wow.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> -three other countries right now in South America with bans that are pending, uh, including Peru, Brazil and Ecuador. Uh, Costa Rica banned a long time ago, I think, probably three or four years ago, uh, which really was phenomenal, because it was sort of ridged between Mexico and South America, and when Costa Rica decided to outlaw traveling circuses, they sort of put in effect- it became very difficult for these traveling circuses to get from one country to another, you know, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala sort of being the gateway of nations. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy feat, and ADI, when they were able to successfully put these bans in effect, sort of made a pledge to the country Bolivia that they would help them with any circus animal that was left over from the ban. Obviously these animals are very difficult and expensive to care for, they have huge needs, they need a lot of land and space, and um, they told Bolivia, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate&rdquo;, you know, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s an animal, we will be responsible for them for the duration of that animal&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; And out of that has come Operation: Lion Arc; ADI successfully moved four lions in May of 2010 out of Bolivia to the PAWS sanctuary in Northern California.</p>

<p>I think it was one of the first times that something like that had been done and the problem was that, um, Bolivia unfortunately, right now, doesn&rsquo;t really have the type of sanctuaries to care for these animals if they&rsquo;re not privately owned through circuses. Hence the giant air-lift, and it seems sort of like an extreme measure to take to, the different life sanctuary, and also because a lot of the laws are so different throughout a lot of those countries, um, there&rsquo;s a fear of leaving some of these animals behind, in essence, they could get sold off, and, and could end up almost anywhere, to a nation which hasn&rsquo;t banned circuses yet, and uh, the hope was really to provide- if the ban was going to take effect, you know, the dream was to improve the circumstances for these animals, not to sort of leave them in a limbo or a purgatory.</p>

<p>So they have gone about the country of Bolivia with the permission and the great help of the nation of Bolivia, uh including the president and mayor and governor of Santa Cruz [California], and have collected in- I think they were able to go to seven circuses in seven days, and collect a bulk of the lions and with the one final lion that they did pick up on February 4th, there&rsquo;s a total of twenty-five [lions], three of them are cubs, and one of them is a quite aged, half-blind lion named Kimba, who was given, uh, you know, just a brief window into [inaudible] in a cage in Bolivia, for the last eight years without ever leaving that cage&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Wow.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> &hellip;and they had to sledge-hammer him out, they literally had to break walls down in the zoo just to get the lions out of the zoo to get him transported. You know, after he retired from some circuses, he&rsquo;d been living in the zoo for eight years, so- and that went well, that went great. And they&rsquo;ve been getting him healthy enough to travel and they will be air-lifting him on February 15 to the wild animal sanctuary just outside of Denver, Colorado. They&rsquo;re the largest and oldest non-profit wild-life sanctuary in the United States and, um, that&rsquo;s sort of just the just of it. Any circus animal- at least, I can speak for in the United States, and having done, you know, a lot of educating myself about South America- it&rsquo;s really one of the most unnatural things that we could ask of these animals. Um, nothing about the circus is in any way humane or natural for animals, particularly large land mammals like lions, bears, elephants, uh, even animals like zebras or llamas, it goes against the very grate of their nature, and I think that we&rsquo;re in the kind of history that&rsquo;s pretty exciting because I think a lot of people are recognizing that, and evolving beyond it, you know, there&rsquo;s other ways- you know, we&rsquo;re stuck with these animals now that can&rsquo;t be released back into the wild because they&rsquo;re not able to do so, and so what is the best possible thing that we can do for them?</p>

<p>The wild-life animal sanctuary in Denver, Colorado allows visitors which is one of the ways that they&rsquo;re able to keep the sanctuary going, and I offer that to people who really want to see these animals, who want to, you know, educate their kids about these animals; don&rsquo;t go to the circus, don&rsquo;t go the zoo. Find a sanctuary in your area, there&rsquo;s a decent amount of them, and take your kids there. I live in California, you know, go whale watching, don&rsquo;t go to Sea World.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Now, you raised a number of really interesting hot topics here. Now, one thing I kind of zeroed in on is when you say having to deal with different countries, I would imagine that gets very, very delicate, <em>(laughs)</em> you know, when you have people from the United States going in and saying &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong, we&rsquo;re gonna take these lions, you know, from you&rdquo;, I mean, how important was it to have the local authorities behind your efforts in that?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think it can be done *without *the local authorities and without the popular support of the region. ADI sort of started their circus campaign- you know, they&rsquo;re originally out of London, their headquarters is is Los Angeles now but they still have a very active office in London- and they began their campaign in Europe and they were able to implement several bans in Europe first, you know, and London has got a ban pending, and I think with the success of that they were able to branch out into other areas. I think they were connected in South America, I think that they saw that there was a dire, dire, dire need in South America, and that was one of the reasons they chose to go there next.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re laughing their American Circus Campaign relatively soon and I think we should&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Oh really?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, I think we should expect that within the year, as well. And because the U.S. is such a juggernaut of different laws and different recommendations and different statistics, I think that, uh, ADI has wanted to make sure that they&rsquo;re very well prepared before they launch and part of the air-lift I think, hopefully, will let people know that ADI is out there and will sort of bring ADI home to the United States and, and that&rsquo;ll create at least a platform for them to slowly begin their launch.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> I do have to ask you this: now, a lot of us who are &ldquo;of a certain age&rdquo;, shall we say <em>(Jorja laughs)</em> have these fond memories of going to the circus, and I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, you know, that was actually one of the big things we were looking for, you know, the lions jumping through the fire, jumping through the hoops. You know, how do you fundamentally change somebody&rsquo;s, I guess, childhood memories of that? You know, is there a challenge to shifting from saying &ldquo;What you were watching was horrible and awful, but we want you to watch this instead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>**JF: **Yeah. Well, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to try and reframe people&rsquo;s memories, you know, certainly if they have good memories, that&rsquo;s a great first connection, you know, because if they have a great memory of animals in a circus then probably they connected at some point that there was a, a love and admiration for these animals. So, I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough- and I&rsquo;m not all that young myself- but I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to you know, kind of grow up with first <em>National Geographic</em> and now *Animal Planet *and you know, IMAX theaters, and I think that there&rsquo;s so many other great ways, including some of these Disney feature films that have been out, that have kind of came out of <em>Planet Earth</em>, there&rsquo;s just so many better ways to do it now, and um, you know that the legacy of importing wild animals all over the world has been a really tragic and sad one across the globe, you know, and has led in many respects to a lot of a lot of these [animal] populations being on the brink of extinction.</p>

<p>Now we have a whole other crisis because even if we can care for a lot of these animals, we don&rsquo;t have all that many places to put them where we can really call it a sanctuary, you know, whether it&rsquo;s in Africa or Europe, the United States, space is limited, it&rsquo;s very expensive, and, you know, along with global warming and so many of these other issues that are pressing on us, is how do we keep habitats and environments that&rsquo;s sustainable for these animals and for the next two hundred, three hundred, four hundred years for our kids and their kids? And really, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s sort of a balance of the planet, I mean all of these animals in the wild have very important jobs that they do, and have kept the balance of the Earth in a beautiful- I would say a very beautiful state, and I don&rsquo;t think you have to be a rocket scientist to look around and see things, you know, everything from like, fishing populations disappearing, you know, at the base of it, we&rsquo;re going to have to feed ourselves and hopefully live on the planet and have enough oxygen and enough trees so we can all flourish and with that, you know, without the wild-life population, I don&rsquo;t think really think that&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> When you say, you know, that all of us can flourish, the lion laying down with the lamb, and us, you know, taking care of everybody as well, what occurs to me is when you do go into countries like Bolivia and you know, like certain farmers in Africa who, you know, have their crops trampled by elephants, I&rsquo;m wondering, is there a very delicate balance where you can say, &ldquo;Look, we care about you humans as well, and here&rsquo;s an alternative that you can do to make a living as, you know, opposed to infringing upon the wild animals, you know, is that part of it as well?</p>

<p>JF: Absolutely, like how can you make this sustainable for everybody? And I mean, my environmentalism and my animal advocacy comes directly out of love for people, you know, and I don&rsquo;t really want to move to Mars, you know, I mean, I guess <em>(host laughs)</em> that can always be a last resort, but-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> <em>(laughing)</em> CSI Mars!</p>

<p>JF: -you know- Yeah! <em>(laughs)</em> I can <em>only</em> imagine. So of course, you know, and that&rsquo;s one of the bigger issues with a lot of these wild animals, is habitat encroachment, you know, and that is because the populations of people are expanding in ways that we didn&rsquo;t predict thirty and forty and fifty years ago, or maybe that we just didn&rsquo;t make space for, and that&rsquo;s where a lot of these clashes are coming from in terms of wild habitats. You know, there&rsquo;s cultural things, you know like in the U.S., I think 80% of wild [animal] trafficking ends up in the United States of China. The U.S. really loves wild animals as pets and entertainment. China loves them as pets and entertainment, they also use them for medicinal purposes and they really eat exotic animals in a way that we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So we all have our cultural sensitivities and things that we can perhaps be working on, you know, for me it starts right here in Los Angeles and California and it is, you know, it&rsquo;s a very tense balance and you have to show a lot of respect for people, and hopefully at the same time we can all work together to make things better for all of us, instead of, you know, at the exclusion of, you know, farmers in let&rsquo;s say the Serengeti or, you know, a lot of animals that will be gone in twenty to twenty-five years, I mean, if you get on the [inaudible] website, I mean it&rsquo;s terrifying, sort of that look at what could happen. I mean now, it was a hundred years from now, then it was sixty years from now, you know now it&rsquo;s twenty years from now so I really invite anybody who cares about these issues, pick your specialty and get involved, because this is something that&rsquo;s gonna happen while most of us are on the planet, we&rsquo;re going to see this happen. And I do think it will lead also to the fall of the human race; I don&rsquo;t think that it will be exclusive to the fall of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>And why is it over so many years it seems like there&rsquo;s been some sort of battle- you know, maybe back when we were cave people, you know, man needed to exert his authority over the planet- at this point, we&rsquo;ve won, I mean we won fair and square, we really-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> I think that&rsquo;s-that&rsquo;s being generous that we-that we won!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> We won that battle, and it&rsquo;s now my generation&rsquo;s time to sort of put a balance back into things. There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to do that, I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there working very diligently on these projects. ADI is one of them, and you know, these animals are coming, primarily with the tremendous benevolence of Bob Barker, who over the last twenty years has just done some phenomenal things for animals, but because ADI has pledged to support these animals for the rest of their natural lives, they are actively seeking support and donations from people who are interested in adopting a lion or seeing these animals through. It&rsquo;s a pretty remarkable undertaking, it&rsquo;s the biggest seizure and rescue operation of lions ever and, um, you can go to- let me get this- savethelionsappeal.com or adiusa.org if you&rsquo;d like to support this endeavor.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen that, you know a lot of us have trouble, you know, fitting our overhead luggage on the plane and I&rsquo;m thinking My God, you know, how do you move a lion, you know-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> *(laughs) *-on the plane from Bolivia?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Twenty-five-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> I mean, as Jorja says, you really have to- just the logistics of moving twenty-five lions-</p>

<p>**JF: **Mm-hmm.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> -is quite amazing. So we&rsquo;re going to take a brief break, and when we&rsquo;re gonna come back, and yes everyone, I am gonna ask Jorja about CSI so don&rsquo;t hang me, I will be right back. <em>(Jorja and the host laugh)</em></p>

<p><em>After the break&hellip;</em></p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> And we&rsquo;re back. And as you can see, Jorja Fox, in addition to being apparently a world investigator <em>(Jorja laughs)</em> in getting these beautiful, exotic animals back here, as we all know, she is one of our favorites on <em>CSI</em> Las Vegas. That&rsquo;s the only CSI for a lot of us out there AHEM, but anyway* (laughs)*</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Jorja plays Sara Sidle who is an amazing- the evolution of that character has been amazing to watch, Jorja. What is this, the eleventh season?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yes! Season eleven! Who coulda thought?</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> And you were gone for, what, about two years, and people went bananas!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Ohhh, well thank you. Yeah, I took a sabbatical, it was, you know, interestingly enough I ended up doing at least a couple of episodes every season so far, but there was a year there, I took sort of a year off where I- I found myself tired and I decided that I wanted to get off TV before people noticed or before, perhaps, my coworkers started to notice. <em>CSI</em> was kind enough to let me go so, and then um, you know, the year passed, and I was ready to work. I did a lot of traveling, I worked on some of my own projects, little things that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do, and things that you know, you kind of want to do &lsquo;em when you&rsquo;re young enough that you&rsquo;ll still &lsquo;em, and, and then I started looking for work and I think I&rsquo;d been looking for work for about three weeks when <em>CSI</em> called me and said &ldquo;Hey, I hear you&rsquo;re looking for work, would you like to come back?&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t think of a single reason under the sun to say no and it&rsquo;s been really fun, I guess I&rsquo;ve been back, you know, two seasons already, almost.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Hold on a second, let me back-track up this. Okay, they had to call you and say &ldquo;Hey I hear you&rsquo;re looking for work?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, you know, they had given me this amazing, beautiful, dramatic goodbye with cake and flowers and (host laughs) a party and you know, I remember saying to Carol Mendehlson, who&rsquo;s our-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> -but they send you to South America, right? Didn&rsquo;t they send you to South America?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> They did!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Interestingly enough?</p>

<p>**JF: **They did. Sara got to go to Costa Rica, she got on the Sea Shepherd off the Galapagos, she did all kinds of exciting things, and the last thing that I said to our show runner Carol Mendehlson was, you know, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you, thank you so much, I&rsquo;m leaving, but I&rsquo;d love to visit sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>**PITC: **Mm-hmm.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> So that sort of- that, you know, one thing led to another and I had first came back, um, when William Petersen was ready to take <em>his</em> sabbatical, they invited me back for a couple of shows, to sort of help him get off the show, and that&rsquo;s where we were left, you know, sort of suspended, you know, and it was one of these great- in my opinion, it was one of these great Hollywood endings with two characters that were going to live happily ever after, exploring the world together, there was a part of me that thought, you know, we should just let that sit, you know, the book is closed, you know, the chapter at the end says &ldquo;The End&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s over, and so, there was that, where I thought maybe the best thing for those characters was to just sort of stay there, and then there was this call from <em>CSI</em> saying &ldquo;Well why don&rsquo;t you just come visit for a little while?&rdquo; and I was thrilled, I never expected that to happen, you know, TV shows move on, you know, when people leave the show for whatever reason, they tend to move on, and so it was very flattering and ended up being great for me, and um, now we&rsquo;re sort of in a balance where I get to do a lot of episodes and, and if there&rsquo;s something else I want to do, like go to Denver in February and greet these lions for a few days, they are often able to tell me to go do it, so it&rsquo;s a great, great job.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> You and Grissom, and as you were saying, that&rsquo;s your wonderful co-star William Petersen, you guys, for a lot of people, have an ideal marriage. *(Jorja cracks up) <em>You know, it&rsquo;s like, you love each other, you Skype in once in a while, &ldquo;Hey, how you doing?&rdquo;, and whatever</em> (laughs)*</p>

<p>**JF: **Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> And I mean, and you, forget it, you teased everybody [in] the last episode [The Two Mrs. Grissoms] that he was on there and you guys were talking&hellip; does that mean that Gil might be coming back?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well thanks for watching, first of all, and-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Oh, of course!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> -and that was, yeah, a really great scene for me, you know, I had done one episode where I was on the Sea Shepherd and I Skyped Grissom, and I essentially break up with him, you know, and say you know, I&rsquo;m not going to wait for you anymore, and you know, I love you and you&rsquo;re free, go live your life, and sort of for that to come full circle and where I&rsquo;m sitting at <em>CSI</em> and he&rsquo;s in Peru, you know, working on these ruins, well, it was a great moment, and he was kind enough to come- I don&rsquo;t think it means anything necessarily for the future of Grissom and Sara on CSI, that would definitely be a question for Billy [Petersen], but I was really grateful that he showed up, and you know, at least in this make-believe world, you know, Sara and Grissom are still very much in love and happily married and, and you know, they were always two very, very independent souls who kind of always went where their heart led them and, and so I think that is a great thing about their relationship that they can be together and they&rsquo;re both people who have both wanted to do some really exotic, crazy things and that they have the space in their relationship to allow each other to do that is really cool for me. I really like them as a couple, too.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> And I mean it really seems they&rsquo;ve both evolved as characters, I mean, you&rsquo;ve really seen them both come out of their shells and I mean every so often you hear a revelation that&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Wow, you know, maybe that&rsquo;s what forms a personality&rdquo; but I gotta tell you, one thing I really love about Sara is, you know, you see that there&rsquo;s a lot more to her than meets the eye, over the past ten years, I mean, she seems very shy and reserved, but I mean, highly intelligent, but very shy and reserved, and then, you know, every so often you like a pearl like you know, you find out she was in foster care, and then you find out that you know, she&rsquo;s had other stuff, and I mean it just seems like really inspiring to a lot of women, I think, that showing a strong woman who&rsquo;s overcome some hardships and has now carved out a successful career for herself.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Thank you, and yeah, I certainly think- and that was very polite of you, I mean, I might describe her as a little socially inept, or *(host laughs) *a little [inaudible]</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> She&rsquo;s a nerd! She&rsquo;s a lab nerd!</p>

<p>**JF: **<em>(laughs)</em> But yeah, you know, it&rsquo;s a testament to our writers, I think, for sure the moral of the story is that your stuff or your junk or your trauma, you know, doesn&rsquo;t have to define you for your entire life, you know, and I think that&rsquo;s a really awesome message, that you can make apple sauce out of apples, you know, that you can, you can persevere, and um, and you know, her and Grissom are very unique, I mean he was kind of eccentric himself when it came to such personal skills, and-</p>

<p>**PITC: **Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> And it took them a <em>really long time</em>&#8212; I think that they &#8212; that there was a connection between them and a chemistry but it took them both a really long time to both decide that they could actually spend their lives with another person. I think they both kind of thought of themselves as loners, and that maybe, that kind of a relationship wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be something they&rsquo;d experience, and they were able to make it work, you know, that&rsquo;s a great message too, you know, you may feel sometimes like you have trouble connecting with people, but there <em>is</em> somebody, somewhere, out there, you know, that might make life more fun, you know, if you share it with them.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Even in a forensics lab!</p>

<p>**JF: **Yeah! *(host laughs) *Even, even in our darkest hours, you know.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> You know, it also seems like you&rsquo;ve been able to weave some aspects of your personality into Sara, I mean, she&rsquo;s a vegetarian, right, she&rsquo;s very-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> She&rsquo;s very involved with animal rights, you don&rsquo;t wanna- I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen a few episodes like that you don&rsquo;t want to work with meat and stuff, and is this something you requested or the writers kinda did?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> We did an episode- it might have even been season one, I think- we did an episode, you know, it&rsquo;s not uncommon in forensics for scientists to use pigs in experiments, primarily because their skin is so similar to humans. So there was an episode where Grissom had gotten himself a pig from the butcher shop and was trying to recreate how long someone might have been dead by watching the pig for several days. And the way he ascertained this was through, you know, what elements, what sort of bugs would visit the body, what time, and he was successful, he was able to recreate how long this poor woman had been dead in a forest, and through that episode, you know, what happened when I got the script, because Sara&rsquo;s supposed to sit with Grissom over this whole thing, I called one of the writers and I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna use a real pig, right? Like, we&rsquo;re not, please, PLEASE don&rsquo;t use a real pig&rdquo; and at that point, Josh Berman, who was one of the writers on the show, said &ldquo;Why, are you a vegetarian?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Well yes I am.&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Wow, so is my mom!&rdquo; so he said &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s make Sara a vegetarian, wouldn&rsquo;t that be cool?&rdquo; and I said yeah it&rsquo;d be great, so it was actually a writer&rsquo;s idea, and uh, we used that episode as sort of a stepping off point for Sara that after having sat with that poor dead pig for three days that she made a personal change in her life that she wasn&rsquo;t gonna eat eat anymore, and she wasn&rsquo;t gonna use animals as experiments.</p>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t use, you know, obviously, all the dead things on <em>CSI</em> are either real, breathing live people or prosthetic, you know, brought-to-you-by the wonders of special effects, and, uh, special effects make-up people, you know, we used a fake pig, uh, and we&rsquo;ve reused him two or three times in the show, he&rsquo;s actually <em>(laughs)</em> he&rsquo;s ended up being worth his cost.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> He brings home the bacon, so we say!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah! Yeah, and I don&rsquo;t condone using animals for experiments, personally, but.</p>

<p>**PITC: **I have to tell you, I have a friend who works in a forensic lab here in New York, and they say, you know what, wow, I wish that we had some of those things that-</p>

<p>**JF: **Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong>* (laughs)* I mean it&rsquo;s- the graphics, and this and that, I mean you guys, although, then again, there were many forensic scientists you&rsquo;ve given birth to through this show.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Ohhhh, well thank you, that would be nice. Yeah, there was a time about three or four years ago, that we had the best-funded forensics lab in the country. *(host laughs) *And it was sitting on a film stage in LA. Almost all of our equipment is real, and it&rsquo;s- you know, some of it is donated, some of it&rsquo;s purchased for the show, and so, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s as true today, but there was something really sad about that at the time, that Hollywood, you know, has the backing behind it to make that happen, there&rsquo;s- I think that the forensics world is doing better than it did before the <em>CSI</em> shows, you know, there&rsquo;s some backlash to that too, in a sense that, you know, people, particularly, they want answers much quicker, you know, they <em>(laughs)</em> they say, &ldquo;Well yeah, but on <em>CSI</em> they can find out the results in, you know, five minutes&rdquo; and you have to wait a few weeks, and I think it&rsquo;s been helpful in court because as forensic evidence is presented, jurors have a better, sort of- it&rsquo;s been more acceptable to them, so forensics is not something they&rsquo;re hearing for the first time when they go into a courtroom.</p>

<p>And thank goodness for it, you know, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really come out of, again, really, the last thirty years of science, you know, has made amazing strides, there, you know, there&rsquo;s a cold case just solved on the news last night of a woman who had killed her kid, I feel like it was-</p>

<p>**PITC: **That&rsquo;s right, I remember seeing that. And the brother recently just came forward and said- my mother- yeah, yeah. That was sad. No, I-I-I-</p>

<p>**JF: **-put the pieces together.</p>

<p><strong>PTIC:</strong> Now on the flip side of that, what I&rsquo;ve heard, like once in a while a criticism is sort of like &ldquo;Yeah, but you&rsquo;re showing criminals exactly what they have to do not to get caught.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yes! Yeah.* (host laughs) <em>I think that&rsquo;s true, and I also think that there&rsquo;s very, very, very few ways to get away with a crime these days, you know, that window- and criminals will always</em> try <em>to think of ways to outsmart, you know, law enforcement- but in the age that we&rsquo;re living in right now, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing at just how little you can actually get away with, you know. And I think the show also shows</em> that* <em>(laughs)</em> Like, oh well, we&rsquo;re probably gonna arrest you. Very few of <em>(laughs)</em> our criminals actually get off; it happens! I was outsmarted by a twelve-year-old, twice, the same genius twelve-year-old. Uh, you gotta watch those kids, because I think they&rsquo;re the most ahead of the technology, you know, of anybody.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Oh yeah, let me tell you. You know, my niece, she&rsquo;s seven years old, she has an iPad, I&rsquo;m like, you gotta be kidding me.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> *Woooow. *</p>

<p>**PITC: **Yeah, yeah, yup, it&rsquo;s amazing. So listen, I really appreciate you spending time with us, I would be remiss with our pets in this city at Life Radio listeners to not let them know that in addition to all this great stuff about you, you are also a native New Yorker.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I am indeed, yes, and I miss it dearly! There&rsquo;ve been several times I&rsquo;ve thought to myself, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t I get on that *CSI *<em>New York</em>?&rdquo; <em>(laughs)</em></p>

<p>*<em>PITC:</em> ***<em>(laughs)</em> They don&rsquo;t- they don&rsquo;t film that in New York, right? I mean everybody&rsquo;s-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> No, they do the same thing we do, and the same thing that Miami does when they go, you know, four times a year or so and they shoot exteriors, so we-we go to Vegas about four times a year, and that would probably be uh, two more times a year that I&rsquo;d get to be in the city that I&rsquo;m in right now, if I&rsquo;m lucky I get there once or twice a year, and you know, I love it. I was born in New York City-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Oh! Okay.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> And my family relocated to a very, very, very, very small town in Florida when I was three.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Oh, okay.</p>

<p>**JF: **So I was primarily young in Florida, I had moved back to New York at the age of sixteen, I finished high school there, and uh, my family would go back and forth a lot. My mom was- had only lived in Montreal, and New York, sort of bigger cities, all her life, and had a dream of taking the kids and moving them down to a very small beach town, which is what she did- she would do, but she would also get homesick, often, for New York, so we would just pack it up, she&rsquo;d take me out of school and we&rsquo;d go up to New York for a week and a half or so and then come back.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Okay, great.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, no, I&rsquo;m a native New Yorker, and uh, my dog, unfortunately, just passed away last week at fourteen.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Oh, my goodness.</p>

<p>**JF: **She was also a native New Yorker, and my cats were also native New Yorkers.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Oh, thank you, yeah, it&rsquo;s been a rough week, but she had a really peaceful goodbye.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Oh my goodness. And what- how do you mean they were native New Yorkers, did you adopt them from here?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, they were all rescues out of New York, yeah. And then I moved to Los Angeles, I guess about&hellip; fourteen years ago now? So they all made the move with me, and adapted, you know, seamlessly, of course, so the weather out here, they loved the idea of having a yard and all that kind of stuff that I didn&rsquo;t have in New York, so. But my dog- you know, I was living in LA when my dog came- it was sort of a weird rescue, a friend of a friend that had a dog that needed a home, and sort of one of those stories, and the original owner was an actor, so he threw out some auditions, he brought the dog, who was ten months old, and for about the first, I&rsquo;d say, eight or nine months of her living in Los Angeles, all she wanted to do was walk up and down concrete streets [inaudible]. <em>(host laughs)</em> I couldn&rsquo;t get her to go hiking, she was- she just didn&rsquo;t get it, and then as she got a little older she was like, &ldquo;Oh, I guess this hiking thing&rsquo;s OK&rdquo;, you know.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Wow, that&rsquo;s-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I have had in these last fifteen years or so, two cats; one came out of a shelter in New York City, one came out of a shelter in Brooklyn, and then a Boxer- I was already living in LA- that came out of New York City out to LA to be with me, and yeah, so all three of my pets are from New York, and were all rescues.<br />
**<br />
PITC:** Wow. And I know you said that you had lost, um, two of them recently.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I lost my dog Ali last Sunday, uh, January 30th-</p>

<p>**PITC: **Awww, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> She was fourteen years and four months young. Um, for a Boxer, that&rsquo;s a really, really, really long, great life, yeah. She&hellip; she was sort of on borrowed time for a few years already, and uh, yeah, I&rsquo;ll miss her horribly. So I&rsquo;m recovering from that, I&rsquo;m sure-I&rsquo;m sure there will be another dog in my future, but I&rsquo;m going to take a little and just celebrate her first.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Never gets easier, it never gets easier.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> No, no, it doesn&rsquo;t, and uh, that&rsquo;s their big joke on us, is that their lifespans are so much shorter than ours, I think* (laughs)* I was thinking, well, maybe I&rsquo;ll get a turtle, you know, or a parrot <em>(host laughs)</em> Takes them a long time! And, uh, but again, I actually don&rsquo;t advocate exotic pets as pets for anybody, but you know, I think about it; it&rsquo;d be nice to have an animal that, you know, would be with me hopefully as long as I have left.</p>

<p>**PITC: **Well, you know, you kinda have by proxy twenty-five lions in Colorado so there you go.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> *(both laugh) <em>It&rsquo;s gonna be exciting! I hope everybody will tune into the ADI website; they do a great job of presenting video diaries, you can sort of check updates almost daily, and sort of join along in this adventure and this journey, and um, Jan Creamer&rsquo;s been in Bolivia for a couple of months already, preparing everything. Tim Phillips, who&rsquo;s based out of London is now there too, the next time I&rsquo;ll see them will be at the Denver airport. We imagine February 16, probably sometime around in the day, and, uh, it is a huge undertaking as you mentioned, getting</em> four* lions to California was a massive ordeal and the plane had to reload in Panama, so you&rsquo;re really bringing in three countries. You had Bolivia, you had the country of Panama and the country of the United States, that were all able to coordinate this together, they landed at San Francisco International in San Francisco. Couldn&rsquo;t have been more amazing, uh, it was an odd request, and not something they get everyday <em>(host laughs)</em> and, uh-</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> I would imagine!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em></p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> &ldquo;Excuse me, customs! Uh, what do you have to declare?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh sorry, five lions.&rdquo; <em>(laughs)</em></p>

<p>**JF: **Yeah, and you know, there&rsquo;s pretty strict, you know, wild-life importation laws in the United States and that&rsquo;s a GOOD thing. But, when you&rsquo;re actually trying to do something like this, it can be a very complicated procedure, the paperwork alone, the different languages that people speak, as I said, um, it&rsquo;s quite an ordeal, and one of the coolest things about these twenty five lions is that a couple of them are-had been living in prides already, under these circus conditions, so they&rsquo;ll be together. As soon as the first lion moved, we were moving three brothers and a sister, and they&rsquo;ve been together their whole lives, and the transition was actually very smooth, and we believe [it&rsquo;s because] we didn&rsquo;t separate them for the entire journey. And so these guys will all go together and the few that didn&rsquo;t know each other have had a chance to get to know each other, in the last couple of months in the temporary compound, which we&rsquo;re very grateful to Mayor Hernandez in Santa Cruz for providing the space for; a large, temporary compound for twenty-five lions! <em>(laughs)</em></p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Uh, yeah! <em>(laughs)</em></p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> That came from Bolivia, and they&rsquo;ll be bidding them farewell, so, um, it&rsquo;s gonna be amazing, I mean the wild animal sanctuary in Colorado is a remarkable place, uh, they have three hundred acres and these animals, you know, most of them have never stepped on grass, they&rsquo;ve never had a pond or a lake to swim around in, their lives will be *drastically *different in a couple of weeks for the better.</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> Jorja, can you tell us one more time how our listeners can help, you know, basically really make this a great happy ending and a great new home for the lions?</p>

<p><strong>JF</strong>: Yes, please! If you&rsquo;re inspired or moved, you can go directly to the savethelionsappeal.com or adiusa.org- there will be a link to their site- ADI, also, I believe will be hosting video diaries if you want to find out more or learn more about these lions. They are endangered and they&rsquo;re incredibly majestic animals, and I think that we need them, and they deserve a nice place to live.</p>

<p>**PITC: **And so we&rsquo;ll be in touch with you hopefully, you know, in a week or two, and see what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Oh, I&rsquo;d love that!</p>

<p>**PITC: **Okay!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, follow up, that&rsquo;d be great!</p>

<p>**PITC: **Fantastic! Jorja, we really appreciate you visiting with us today, thank you.</p>

<p>**JF: **Oh Diane, thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>PITC:</strong> That was very cool. I really hope that you guys got some good dish from <em>CSI</em> Las Vegas from, of course, the wonderful Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle, and we&rsquo;re gonna check in with her again and see how the lions are doing. We will put all the information she had spoken about how you can help the lions settle in at their new home, up on our Pets In The City On PetLife Radio website, so check that out after you listen.</p>

		<p><strong>Watch Now: Trouble on the &lsquo;CSI&rsquo; Set</strong></p>

<p><strong>George Eads:</strong> For the last couple years I was a big fan of the &ldquo;Hoarders&rdquo; documentary program. And so I was telling everybody-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I think many of us are. George turned me on to it.</p>

<p><strong>GE:</strong> I was telling you the other night!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> &ldquo;I was watching this show the other night and you gotta check it out!&rdquo; And I went and checked it out, and now it&rsquo;s on my TiVo. So this is definitely a story George has wanted to tell for a while. It was in the making, it was gonna happen, and now it&rsquo;s happening. It is really exciting when that &hellip; happens.</p>

<p><strong>GE:</strong> One of the things that we <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have to deal with when we go to crime scenes is the odor. So we got lucky when it comes to that, because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Movie Trash.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s still pretty disgusting under there.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It&rsquo;s unbelievable, and you&rsquo;ve got three and a half straight days in there. So yes, again, thank god it&rsquo;s a set, but its extremely tight quarters. It&rsquo;s very intimate. You get the crew in there setting lights, and move through it.</p>

<p><strong>GE:</strong> Yeah but we talked about how there&rsquo;s nobody we&rsquo;d rather be with if we were stuck in a stinky set in tight quarters. You know?</p>

		<p>JANE VELEZ-MITCHELL: In tonight&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo;, a fabulous mercy mission for four rescued circus lions. These magnificent animals were freed from their pitiful, abusive existence in a Bolivian circus last month. Bolivia recently did what every country should do &#8212; banned the use of animals in circuses. These majestic animals will live out their lives at the amazing Paws Sanctuary in northern California.</p>

<p>Our guest tonight, CSI star, Jorja Fox, who was right there for their dramatic arrival.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>JORJA FOX, ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Lion number one &#8212; come on down.</p>

<p>TIM PHILLIPS, ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL: These lions have lived their life in a tiny, rusting, disgusting cage on the back of a lorry. Tomorrow they&rsquo;re going to feel the wind blow in their face. They&rsquo;re going to feel grass beneath their feet. They&rsquo;re going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: I am so thrilled to welcome actress Jorja Fox, ambassador for Animal Defenders International. Jorja, great to see you.</p>

<p>Tell us how you felt inside watching these majestic animals take their very first steps into freedom.</p>

<p>FOX: Well, Jane, thanks for having me. It was sheer magic. It was such a beautiful moment. You know, these kind of thing don&rsquo;t happen very often. I wish that I can say that they did. But to see animals that have been in cages their entire lives, large, endangered, land mammals, take to grass is a spectacular thing to see.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Now, while in the circus, two of the rescued lions had their fang cut out so the trainers could handle them. Another had her claws ripped out one by one without any anesthesia. You know it&rsquo;s time for this kind of institutionalized animal torture to stop.</p>

<p>Check this out.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>PHILLIPS: There&rsquo;s a welfare problem at the moment, but that&rsquo;s in the circuses. If we shut them we can give these animals a great life. So the world is watching.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Jorja, what do people need to know about the scores of animals who are still suffering in the captivity of zoos and circuses around the world?</p>

<p>FOX: Well, I think there&rsquo;s several thing that people should know. Number one, most of these animals are on the endangered species list or on the vulnerable list. We have so few resources left on this planet. And I really think it&rsquo;s our responsibility to care for the one that we have.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth about zoos and circuses is that they&rsquo;re cruel, they&rsquo;re arcane, they are not suitable places for animals, especially large wild animals. I think we&rsquo;ve evolved beyond them. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who realize in the same way that we&rsquo;ve evolved beyond asbestos and lead paint that we&rsquo;re now at a place in our evolution where we can say, you know what, this is not a compassionate thing, this is not a smart thing. It&rsquo;s a waste of resources and it&rsquo;s a waste of these animals&rsquo; lives.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Now, when you saw the animals go from their cages and actually step on grass for the very first time, what do you think they were thinking? What kind of a transformation did they experience?</p>

<p>FOX: Well, these are animals that really had spent most of their lives in small pens on the back of a truck. Even though they were exhausted &#8212; it was a 14-hour journey &#8212; they weren&rsquo;t fed during the journey. They did have access to water.</p>

<p>When they finally reached the sanctuary in a very rural, remote area in California, they leapt. They leapt like you would see small puppies leaping outside in the park somewhere.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: I am so happy and thank you so much. And the animals thank you.</p>

<p>Yey, Jorja Fox of CSI. And we love these lions. If you love them &#8212; hey, don&rsquo;t go to the circus.</p>

		<p><strong>Host:</strong> &hellip; It&rsquo;s 9:15.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And what a treat for us. <em>CSI</em> returns tonight at 9 on CBS. Ladies and gentlemen, Jorja Fox right now on the Kevin and Bean show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Aw, thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> More importantly, Sara Sidle returns tonight. That&rsquo;s what I care about.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Yes! Yes yes yes.!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> What your character has been put through in the course of this series, Jorja-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> My goodness gracious! Right?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &ndash; is been ridiculous!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, I would have to agree. But happily so. It&rsquo;s been so much fun to do all that stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Great stuff to play, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There was one episode alone where I felt like the writers were trying to kill me. Just about every way that you could try to kill somebody on this show.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> They crushed you with a car, I remember that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah! There was under the car, there was getting thrown out of the car, there was a fistfight, there was walking through the desert. You know, pretty much, yeah! The whole episode.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And then they sent you off to Costa Rica. And now you&rsquo;re back.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve last seen Sara. That was a big moment, cause there Billy and I were, under the sort of like, the Costa Rican canopy, and it was-</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> By Billy you mean William Petersen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> William Petersen, of course, yes. He plays Grissom.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna start calling him Billy! I like that!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Only it may be a little overly familiar! But I thought &ldquo;Well, this might be it!&rdquo; You know, &ldquo;This might be the end of Sara&rsquo;s chapter, it might be the last time I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; So I was very surprised to get a call this summer.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And that time, you came back cause Warrick got shot. Right? That was the circumstance?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, well that was, you know, that&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s sort of a touchy subject. I wish that Warrick was alive out there, somewhere. But. Warrick was murdered, before the last scene where Billy goes to Costa Rica. So the last time we see &ndash;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Oh! that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s right!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ndash; William Petersen and Sara Sidle, is in a Costa Rican rainforest.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> My timeline was off.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, you know, Jorja, time travel is very big on TV these days. Isn&rsquo;t it possible that you guys could go back to just before he was shot and stop it? Save him? Put him back on the show?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I- You know, I&rsquo;ve been pitching a prequel for years! It gets harder and harder. We&rsquo;re starting our tenth season, so to try and do a prequel means people have to de-age us by a decade. And that&rsquo;s pretty challenging at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Piece of cake! Piece of cake.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Maybe the animated prequel.</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Before we get caught up and talk about what happens tonight, and the return of season 10, thereâs no way anyone, in the beginning, thought that <em>CSI</em> would turn into one of the biggest hits in the history of television. When you guys started, I mean, this was something new on network television. Your show came out, doing stuff different. But nobody expected the juggernaut that it became, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I thought a show about death, on a Friday night, was gonna be a gigantic clunker. Really, terrible, horrible, clunker. But the story was so intriguing to me, I sort of fell under a trance from the moment I read the script. I was like &ldquo;Alright, well I have to do this!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> I think, people take it for granted now, but at the time we had never seen anything like it before on television.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you. Well, there was Quincy! That goes back a ways&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Host 2:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] This is far stretch from Quincy. Forensics have come a long way since Quincy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] Yes. And they&rsquo;re still coming a long way which, I think, is an advantage that we have. New technology is coming out every month, and we can use it.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I remember in the early episodes, where they would follow the path of a bullet into the body, and show you all the damage it does. And your head would explode! You&rsquo;d never seen anything like it, even in a movie, let alone on television! And then, you thought initially, week to week, solving cases, we&rsquo;ve seen this done on tons of procedural cop shows, and that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the standard. The old standards.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But the character development in <em>CSI</em> is what I feel really set it apart. How we got so attached to your characters and followed them through all these different permutations over the years.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Like an old suit, from the 70s, slowly but surely-</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But you find twenty bucks pockets! Now you must have, in the course of research or just interaction with experts that come by to advice on the show, you must have dealt with a lot of real life C.S.I. people over the years. Who are the people that go into this field, that love this kind of work? What drives them?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> It&rsquo;s a very diverse group. I think that there&rsquo;s a couple things they have to have. They have to have almost like an OCD type of focus, and a patience and a persistence. And I think they&rsquo;ve got to be very, very, committed to crime fighting. And we still, every day, we have a tech advisor on our set, every day, still trying to help us look as realistic as possible. There&rsquo;s real crime scene investigators in the writers room almost every day. We have personal relationships with a lot of those guys, both from &ndash; The cool thing about our show because we shoot in LA but we take place in Vegas is that we can &ndash; if it&rsquo;s real in either one of those cities, we can put it on air. So we have people from both cities giving us stories and advice.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Oh I see! Are there are lot of women that go into the field? And are there <em>more</em> women going into the field now because of you? And because of Catherine&rsquo;s character?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well that&rsquo;s very kind of you. They tell us that that&rsquo;s true. That yes, there are a lot of women going into the field. One of our first advisors, Liz Devine, was in Los Angeles, a very early sort of woman in the field, and she was blonde and well endowed in all the right places. Sort of faced that textbook stuff you hear about when women enter fields that they&rsquo;re not traditionally in. More and more so, I think women, if I&rsquo;m going to get stereotypical, I think women are really, really geared towards the field because of that patience and that persistence.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> But they&rsquo;re not really smart enough though, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> They&rsquo;re very good at detail oriented work, where you&rsquo;re on hour eleven and you&rsquo;re still holding your focus.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Really it&rsquo;s just puzzle solving more than anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, great big puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Let me ask you one more question before the break. Jorja Fox is here and will tell you all about the premiere of season ten of <em>CSI</em>. But here&rsquo;s the question I have to ask, is it true that because of the success of <em>CSI</em>, it is harder now to impress a jury? Or harder to &ndash; in many cases a jury will think that they real life is like the television show, and it makes it harder for prosecutors sometimes, when they don&rsquo;t have the slam dunk, scientific evidence that you often come up with on your show. Have you heard that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> What we hear, actually, is the opposite. We hear it&rsquo;s a lot harder for cops. For instance, I get my car broken into, and a police officer arrives, and I want the crime solved in, like, 48-hours, and I want him to pull out his DNA kit, fingerprinting and stuff. I think, originally, in courtrooms, it made it a little easier, because these guys were pitching this kind of science, for a while, but juries weren&rsquo;t quite grasping it. Now they have a really good understanding of what all of it means.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Ballistics, GSR, latent GSR! GSR all over his hands!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Laypeople &ndash; We amateurs know so much more about police work and science of the C.S.I. than we ever would have thought possible, because you found a way to make it entertaining.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> <em>CSI</em> returns tonight at 9. A quick break! More with Jorja Fox, if she doesn&rsquo;t give us all the Swine Flu, when we return, right after this on the Kevin and Bean Show!</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Jorja Fox is in our studio. The return of <em>CSI</em>, season 10, tonight at 9 on CBS. Now because you&rsquo;re the big dog on the television schedule, every year the other networks try to figure out &ldquo;How are we going to take <em>CSI</em> down.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are we going to do this year to take <em>CSI</em> down?&rdquo; You have been up against every show in the history of television.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> True! Yeah, and we&rsquo;re up against a pretty good one right now, who&rsquo;s name I can&rsquo;t mention on the air. But you guys have been promoting it several times this morning.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa (co-host):</strong> Oops!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> We&rsquo;re not responsible for commercials.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, little medical drama.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Don&rsquo;t hold it against us! &ndash; OH! That one! Oh that show SUCKS! It&rsquo;s all <em>CSI</em>! It&rsquo;s way <em>CSI</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Aww! Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> You&rsquo;re either gay or Lisa if you&rsquo;re gonna watch that show.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> It&rsquo;s just a chick show, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> So Sara returns tonight. Do we find out the state of her relationship with Grissom, while they&rsquo;ve been away? Do we look into that at all this evening?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> In about 12 short hours, in Los Angeles, you will. I think you&rsquo;ll get at least a sort of an establishing amount of information that I was very pleased with.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> We&rsquo;ve all been curious what&rsquo;s been going on after that kiss in Costa Rica.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I think we were in Costa Rica for a nice long time. That&rsquo;s all I can say at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Got a lot accomplished, did you?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How used to seeing Sara can we get, as fans of the show? You gonna be around for a while, or is this another hit and run? You gonna tease us and run off again? Another foreign country you gonna run off to?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I know, right? I keep having these really big, dramatic, goodbyes, and then &ndash; It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Oh, gosh! It&rsquo;s her again!&rdquo; I think you can&rsquo;t pull that off that much before &ndash; I mean people are already rolling their eyes at me. They&rsquo;ve done that for years. That will continue, I think, if I keep saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> &ldquo;But this time I mean it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;Send me flowers!&rdquo; No, I&rsquo;m visiting, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to do so. As I said, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it at all, especially after the Costa Rican episode. SO we&rsquo;ll see! We&rsquo;re taking it one day at a time. It&rsquo;s so much fun, it&rsquo;s like going home in some respects. In some respects it&rsquo;s like having a brand new job and being somewhere for the first time. I have so much love and devotion in my heart for everybody there.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How&rsquo;s Laurence Flishburn- Fishburne to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Laurence Flishburn?</p>

<p>[<em>Everyone laughs</em>]</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Laurence Flishburn.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Notable actor?</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Yeah. I&rsquo;ve started drinking already. Laurence Fishburne, one of my favorite actors, and he&rsquo;s so good on the show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> He is! He&rsquo;s spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> How exciting is it to work with that stature when you come back to a project like <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Very humbly. You know, Liev Schrieber guest stared a couple seasons ago too, and he and Fishburne would be two of my all time favorite actors. It&rsquo;s just kind of weird that all of the sudden they&rsquo;re sort of like at your house. You know? Like they knock on the door and you&rsquo;re like &lsquo;Hey, come on in! Would you like a cup of coffee?&rsquo; or something. He&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s as kind and benevolent and generous and sweet and funny as you could ever imagine that he might be.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> There&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve got smart guys and gals running the show. Because when you lose your star, when you lose Mr. Grissom&rsquo;s character, when you lose that you need a guy with &ndash; not only a great actor, but with gravitas. Who can come in and pick up the slack. And he has that. He&rsquo;s one of those guys, you can&rsquo;t take your eyes off the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Mesmerizing. And he&rsquo;s sicker than I am and he&rsquo;s in New York doing the press, so you&rsquo;ve gotta give him credit for that.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> He&rsquo;s spreading the virus on that coast.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We all have the <em>CSI</em> bug, it&rsquo;s very contagious.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> What did you do, when you left the show, about the show? Did you continue to watch it as a fan, or did you not want to see your boyfriend move on with another woman?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah! That was scary! And that happened a little bit. Sort of. They left that very ambiguous, thank God. I watched for a while and then I realized, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on sabbatical. I&rsquo;m taking a year off.&rdquo; And then I kind of turned off my TV. So for the most part there was very little that I watched, including <em>CSI</em>, in that year. I did a bunch of traveling.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Wow! That&rsquo;s a surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I thought, if I&rsquo;m really gonna take a year off, as long as my heads in the game, if I&rsquo;m watching TV every night. But, when they called this summer, I had them TIVO&rsquo;d, most of them, and I did sit down at watch a lot of them. I still have a couple left to watch. I&rsquo;ve worked my way up to the season finale of last year, it&rsquo;s the one episode I haven&rsquo;t see yet. Which is weird, because we&rsquo;re premiering tonight, so I&rsquo;ve probably have to go home and watch it today! I have to watch it this afternoon! And I thought last season was amazing, I thought they did a really great job. It&rsquo;s really difficult to lose three characters in the space of a year or so. The writers are brilliant. I thought they handled very well, and I thought that &ndash; there hasn&rsquo;t been a ton of subtext on <em>CSI</em> the last year. Everybody&rsquo;s been grieving the loss of old people, and also hopeful of new folks coming in. I think that played on screen a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And plus, you just want to see McDreamy happy. Right?</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Not the same show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry, who are you? What radio show is this? Where am I?</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> Big boy!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Here&rsquo;s a tweet question for you, Jorja. Eric wants to know if it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to act with all the special effects that they use on the show?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Eric. To be honest with you, I rarely see the special effects. We&rsquo;re generally in a stage, we&rsquo;re in a room. We see more &ndash; we see the stunts and the car wrecks and things like that. But a lot of the <em>CSI</em> stuff that they do comes in post-production, which is one of the reasons I actually really watch the show! Because so much of it happens in post. The music gets laid in post. We&rsquo;re really proud of our music, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of really amazing bands come through. And I like to watch everybody else&rsquo;s work and see what they did.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Tonight at nine on CBS. For folks who are gonna try <em>CSI</em> for the first time, or haven&rsquo;t been paying as close attention as they should, what is the 30-second setup that you give people that are prepared to sit down and watch <em>CSI</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Uh &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Ten years of work!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> That&rsquo;s not saying recap every plot point!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I gotta pitch it? I can say this. When I read the script this summer, I think, whenever you&rsquo;ve been on as long as we have &ndash; and we&rsquo;re ooooolllld now, I feel like we&rsquo;ve got canes and walkers and all kinds of stuff &hellip; Geritol. I read the script, I was excited I was coming back, and I was like, &ldquo;You know, this show&rsquo;s probably peaked. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s gonna be a great script.&rdquo; I thought it&rsquo;s probably &hellip; The best is in the past. And when I read the first page of the first scene, I was strapped into a seatbelt and I thought to myself &ldquo;Game. On.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Wow! That sounds great.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I&rsquo;m excited!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> And I hope that Sara and Catherine will finally act on their long standing attraction to one another.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> That&rsquo;s been coming up a lot, actually!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> I think it&rsquo;s about time for that wrinkle to be &hellip; on <em>CSI</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Someone should get something on <em>CSI</em>!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Exactly!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, sweeps have got to be right around the corner. Let&rsquo;s not be crazy here.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, Jorja, so nice to finally meet you. We&rsquo;ll happily take the Swine Flu from you-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Oh, great!</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> -just because you happen to be here today.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you so much for having me, I&rsquo;m a huge fan. You guys have been so nice to me for such a long time, and it&rsquo;s really an honor to be here.</p>

<p><strong>Host:</strong> Thank you, Jorja. <em>CSI</em> tonight at 9 on CBS!</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> It was breathtaking, it was magic. There was so much going on on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; that I certainly had never seen on television before. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve seen a lot of it in feature films. The use of steady-cams &hellip; you could do almost an entire act of the show in one sweeping, sort of solid, motion.
