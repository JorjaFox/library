		<p><strong>Monica Gleberman</strong> .. and just ask you, how did you get involved in acting to begin with?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh my goodness. I wanted to act since I was probably four or five years old. I think that the television that sat in the living room of my house was one of the bigger influences in my life. It was definitely a babysitter for me. You know, I grew up in a small town, so there weren&rsquo;t many acting programs. And it was high school before I was able to be in a drama class. I think there were two things that happened. First of all I love it so much, and then second of all, people were really supportive of me, and doing acting. I think I had a lot of support doing it, and so there was no doubt in my mind. I went to New York and got lucky. I got in [something] very quickly because I ignored all these signs that said &ldquo;Do Not Enter.&rdquo; [laughter] I didn&rsquo;t have an agency, you know &#8216;Don&rsquo;t go beyond this point.&rsquo; And I sort of ignored all of those signs that told me not to go further and landed up in an agency, and I was able to have a conversation with my agency and I had an audition, and they started sending me out. It was so processed. But definitely I started my career in New York and was there for probably seven years before ending up in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I have followed your career, and of course I did research before this. You have had some major television show lucky jobs. Some of the biggest shows known to man. So I want to ask you, of course you were on ER, you were on The West Wing. What was it like- I know when you&rsquo;re on it, you might not think &#8216;This is huge&rsquo; and might not realize how big it is. But looking back, reflecting back on your appearances, what does that feel like? To look back and note that you were on these two shows that are probably going down in history as some of the best television?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Oh wow. Thank you. I think it was huge at the time for me. <em>ER</em> in particular because I started on <em>ER</em> in season three and they were the number one show in the country and those numbers were bigger then what you see now because there was less television to choose from. And less appointment television. I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but people had to actually turn on the TV at the right time. VCR&rsquo;s existed but even then, people wanted to a lot of the bigger shows live so they could talk about them the next day. So I was terrified. Even though I hadnât watched ER, it was my momâs favorite show and a lot of my friends favorite shows and I was absolutely terrified when I got the job because I felt like in a week or two&rsquo;s time, everyone in America was going to know I was an impostor. That I was just claiming to be an actor and I was terrible. So I came really close to just driving to Mexico the week before I started and forgetting the whole thing. But I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. I always felt it was a pretty incredible learning experience, to get to spend time with that caliber of people every day, writers and actors and BPs(?) and directors.</p>

<p>And absolutely the same goes for <em>West Wing</em>. I think <em>West Wing</em>&hellip; I was a huge fan then, of Sorkin, and <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> had a number of the same producers. I think the thing that surprised me the most for myself was I could get to be a part of telling a wonderful story like that. It was something that I hadn&rsquo;t even dreamed of. I just felt like it was such an honor to get to try and tell that story. I really like looked after Martin Sheen&rsquo;s daughter. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it! I got to do something like that! I think that Sorkin, he said at the time on <em>West Wing</em>, he&rsquo;s alone, and there had been very few women Secret Service Agents at that time, that had actually been on screen. Even getting to be that, getting to be this female Secret Service Agent was kind of a lot of fun that people hadn&rsquo;t gotten to do.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> And I know, obviously, you&rsquo;ve done a ton of movies and other TV shows, and then you land <em>CSI</em>. Which, again, another- it&rsquo;s like crazy, your career, because it&rsquo;s another huge show! So I want to go back to Season one, and what that was like, finding out you&rsquo;re going to be playing Sara, and where your mind was when you got that call.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Um. That was also a big surprise. I really didnât think that <em>CSI</em> was going to be successful. I fell in love with the story and the idea of it. Again, at the time it was something that was pretty different and something that I hadnât really read about often. You know, <em>Quincy</em> was sort of the thing that I could think of that sort of reminded me a little of <em>CSI</em>. And I thought nobody was really going to watch a show about death on a Friday night, that is just kind of not a really American culture thing to do. I was so wrong about that. I really thought I would do <em>CSI</em>, have some fun and be back on <em>The West Wing</em> by Christmas. You know, that&rsquo;s what I thought was going to happen! I thought the show was going to get canceled and here I am thirteen years later. And it was just this monster. Not &#8212; I guess monster&rsquo;s kind of &#8212; this behemoth that none of us expected. I think that nobody could have imagined how big the ride was going to get.</p>

<p>And thank you for saying that! I&rsquo;m actually starting my eighteenth consecutive season in a row on Prime Time television. It&rsquo;s big for me.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I know! It&rsquo;s crazy!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> So thanks for talking about that stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask- so were you surprised &#8212; before we get into Sara and where she&rsquo;s gone over the course of- and now we&rsquo;re in- there&rsquo;s gonna be a fourteenth season. I want to ask you, I know that in 2007 you had announced that you were leaving the show. Were you surprised at how many fans freaked out and started sending in gifts and money and started a campaign to try to keep you on <em>CSI</em>? Was that shocking to you at how many people cared about this character?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. It was one of the most magnificent experiences. I had no idea there would be that kind of a response. Truthfully, that was my season twelve in a row, and I was tired. I was just thinking &#8216;Oh my god, I just need to lie down for a minute.&rsquo; I just needed to kind of sit down and reground. So I wanted to get off-screen before it started to show on screen, or before my coworkers started to notice. It was an amazing show of support, and I wished I could have changed my mind to show the fans the amount of gratitude I had for them suggesting that I stay. Honestly, if I wasn&rsquo;t so exhausted, I absolutely would have. So yeah, it was an amazing feeling of surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So now that you&rsquo;re back, and you&rsquo;ve been back for a while, everyone&rsquo;s been super excited. I want to know from you how has Sara changed from season one, I know she&rsquo;s had a lot of life changes with the proposal and getting married, but how has she changed from season one to season thirteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It&rsquo;s funny. I think in some ways she really hasnât changed that much [laughs]. There&rsquo;s been some <em>seemingly</em> big changes. When we met Sara in 2000, if anything I think she was very much a product of her past and of her history and the things she experienced as a young kid. You know, her mother killed her father and she was in foster care for a period of time. I think that she had this drive to be a CSI that definitely stems from her experiences as a kid. I think when she left in season 7, and was gone most of season 8, she had a chance to really wrestle those demons and maybe not feel like she is controlled by her past anymore. She kind of cleared all of the ghosts out for herself.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are in season thirteen and I feel like we have a very mature character, who is just as passionate about the cases and just as invested, but is somehow free of her history and that is kind of the way I&rsquo;ve been playing the character for the last couple of season. And yet at the same time, now we are in season fourteen, I do feel that Sara- there is this compulsive drive, something very deep rooted. She can&rsquo;t stop being a CSI, it&rsquo;s what fuels her, maybe the duration of her life, she&rsquo;s going to be there in the trenches, on the street, in the muck, in the darkness, trying to get justice for people. I&rsquo;m looking at it again, myself, and like &ldquo;huh!&rdquo; I thought the compulsive side of her was finished, and now maybe it&rsquo;s not, not at all. Maybe she&rsquo;s just the same.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> What can fans look forward to this season? What kind of cases? What are you guys going to get involved with, cause there&rsquo;s always a craziness happening every episode. So what can fans expect this season for the upcoming episodes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think so far &#8212; we are in the middle of episode 7 and I&rsquo;ve seen the script for eight, and I think we have an amazing season opening up. Really exciting. We have some incredible guest stars including somebody likeâ¦ oh you know what I donât know if I could say cause I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m a spoiler alert. [laughs] We have some really interesting guest stars and a cooking show in episode four that is kind of based on these food contests on the food networks. There is funny stuff, there is haunting stuff â I think the writers this year again, they suggested to me, they like to pick a theme every season, and this one is definitely going to be about darkness and going darker and going deeper.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a darker season of <em>CSI</em>, but within that also there&rsquo;s going to be as much character stuff as there was last year. I think they&rsquo;re continuing to write a lot of character stuff, which is great. Certainly we start the season with Morgan in jeopardy, the stakes are really high. We also start the season with a funeral and itâs not really until we get to the end of the show that you, the audience, will come to find out why we&rsquo;re at the funeral and who has passed. Itâs a very compelling kind of suspenseful episode.</p>

<p>You know, yeah it gets crazier every year. I don&rsquo;t know how the writers come up with stuff in season fourteen. The unfortunate thing is there&rsquo;s no shortage of crazy crime in America to draw from. But the stakes continue to get higher, and I hope the fans will continue to enjoy that. I always am partial to the action/adventure show. And so in those episodes where we get a little kooky, hopefully the fans will still be able to roll with us.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I wanted to ask you, was it nice that all current cast members continued on for season fourteen?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Absolutely! Because we have had so many changes. You know, part of me, you were speaking about <em>ER</em>, <em>ER</em> began to lose their core cast members in season three. So the fact that our show made it to season seven with the core cast intact, I think is a testament to the show and a compliment to how much we actually did get along and liked working together and did like the work itself. I think very few shows have gone seven seasons retaining their full original cast.</p>

<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s been really nice to have a cast that&rsquo;s been able to stay together for a couple of seasons. You can&rsquo;t fake chemistry. You&rsquo;ve sort of got to build it organically. The more you know each other, the more you work together, the deeper you can go. It&rsquo;s given a chance for that. I think it&rsquo;s been kind of a really great thing for the writers, because there were a lot of seasons where it was really hard for them to start breaking stories over the summer, because they weren&rsquo;t completely sure who their cast was going to be. Knowing early enough that they were going to have everyone has allowed them to spread their wings more than they could for a bunch of season.</p>

<p>This team, this troupe of actors, you never think that &#8216;Wow, three new actors in practically one season. This is definitely- this can&rsquo;t go well. This is going to be difficult.&rsquo; And to love these three actors as much as I do, as much as we all do, we&rsquo;re having so much fun every day. I hope it shows on screen. As usual, I&rsquo;m just grateful I get to come here and hang out, because it&rsquo;s a really fun place to be.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Of course I have to ask too, season fourteen, will mark the 300th episode, which is like, nuts. So what is that? What have you guys, I think it&rsquo;s like mid-season, right? The 300th?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> The 300th? Episode five. We&rsquo;re pretty soon, like pretty pretty soon. We&rsquo;re going to do ten new shows in a row. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve done that before. And so, yeah, I think five weeks after the premiere tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the 300th episode.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> So what is that like? Being a part of &hellip; I feel like a lot of this interview is about you being a part of these crazy, amazing, genius shows. And not only do you have this awesome career, but you&rsquo;re a part of another benchmark, which is the 300th episode. So what is that like, being a part of?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> It was such an honor for me. You know, it is a milestone. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it going in, but then we all showed up for work the first day, and a couple people gave speeches, and I started to feel the gravity of it all. I think it&rsquo;s been a great second chance for me. I missed the 200th episode, I wasn&rsquo;t here. I was here for the 100th episode. And to get to be a part of the 300th episode meant a lot to me. More than I even imagined it would. I haven&rsquo;t done 300 episodes yet, I&rsquo;m behind several members of the cast because I did take that season off, and I don&rsquo;t appear in every episode every year. I think with my combined with my <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em> I might be on episode 296 or something. I can share that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because <em>ER</em> went 300 episodes, and Marg Helgenberger, George Eads and myself had all had parts on <em>ER</em>, so with another show that the three of us can be happy for and be a part of this tiny piece of <em>ER</em> history. Of course, the history that we have on <em>CSI</em> is a lot deeper and bigger. It&rsquo;s really cool. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever going to happen to me again, to be a part of something like this. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to be possible for a lot of shows to get to do this. Most shows are doing 13 episodes a year instead of 24, which is what we started out with. It takes a long time doing 13 episodes a season to get to 300 episodes. I think this is kind of a marker we may not see that much of in the future. It meant a lot and I&rsquo;m really proud of- for everyone. I&rsquo;m really proud of everyone and just very excited to get to be a part of it. It&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> I want to ask, and I know it could be a little spoiler, but in the 300th episode, I&rsquo;ve heard rumors there might be some flash backs? Is that&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Ah yes. Flashbacks slash faux-backs. [laughs] That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re calling them. We did out best. It has been thirteen years. [laughs] Thirteen meaningful years. But it was truly fun and embarrassing and silly to try and do it- I hope we pulled it off. I hope the fans enjoy it. There&rsquo;s- You know it&rsquo;s not a huge chunk of the show, but three flashbacks. Four I think! We go back to 2000. There&rsquo;s some funny clothes, and funny hairstyles. I threw in a wig. And it&rsquo;s great. We do, we&rsquo;re- the episode is really about a cold case from 2000, that has certainly haunted Sara for the last thirteen years. And I think it, within the show, Sara feels a certain exuberance at having a second chance at a case she thought had really slipped through her fingers.</p>

<p>So not only did I get a second chance to be a part of something so exciting, but she&rsquo;s getting a second chance to really try and find justice for somebody who&rsquo;s living a nightmare several times.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Is there anything else you want to tell to the fans who are super excited &#8212; they&rsquo;re counting down the hours to the premiere. Is there anything you want to say to them? Anything about the season or just in general that you want them to know?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> I think yes. I wanna say to all the fans of CSI, thank you so much! Thank you thank you thank you thank you for your support all these years. We are continually surprised and completely elated that we get ratings every years, that we continue to get to be on this show and do these things, that&rsquo;s all because of you. Thank you for your loyalty and your willingness to go on some really crazy rides with us. I hope this year we don&rsquo;t disappoint you and we&rsquo;re really excited to show you what we have coming up.</p>

<p><strong>Monica</strong> Okay! Great! Those were all my questions.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja</strong> Thank you so much, Monica, it was great speaking with you.</p>

<p>I like to think that I know Marg very well. And she&rsquo;s one of the toughest, most stoic people &lsquo; forget about woman or ladies &lsquo; I mean one of the most stoic people I&rsquo;ve ever met. And these moments where she&rsquo;s kind of overcome are once in a blue moon. Probably the last time I ever saw that happen her dog died, probably six years ago. She&rsquo;s got nerves of steel. So yeah, it&rsquo;s really overwhelming. I lovingly call this job the &lsquo;Hotel California&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s a line in the song that says that &lsquo;You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave.&lsquo; I&rsquo;ve made that joke to her several times in the last couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be back, don&rsquo;t worry. You&rsquo;re always a part of the team. You&rsquo;re always part of the family.&lsquo; And I think that, I mean, I believe in my heart I think it makes it easier to say goodbye to her right now because I believe in my heart she will be back at some point, some time. Obviously that will be Marg&rsquo;s decision and that will be the writers&rsquo; decision. And, you know, fate will prevail.</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you train or break an elephant? That word, &ldquo;break&rdquo;.</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elephants are extremely social and they need the environment, they need movement, they need exercise.</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Abused, 24 hours until the baby totally lost their mind. Many baby died.</p>

<p>Then the baby elephant fear the man. The man can control and the boy make baby elephant obey.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: We&rsquo;re talking about another kind of crime right now. We&rsquo;ve got a famous CSI investigator on this case looking into disturbing horrific animal abuse. You recognize her &#8212; from CSI? That&rsquo;s right. The CSI investigator, known to the rest of the world as Jorja Fox and she is fighting for elephants.</p>

<p>When people use elephants as entertainment, most don&rsquo;t think, oh, they see these beautiful animals going here, there or everywhere. They don&rsquo;t realize how these animals were captured; how they were taken from the wild. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans. Elephants tortured and abused to perform for humans.</p>

<p>But one 14-year-old girl figured it out. She made the connection. And now she is making a movie, &ldquo;How I Became an Elephant&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s changing hearts and saving lives, one person and one elephant at a time.</p>

<p>Joining me now to talk about her passion for this heroic effort, actress Jorja Fox, star of CSI; you know her from this show. Check it out.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You showed your hand today to a master manipulator, your words.</p>

<p>JORJA FOX, ACTRESS, ANIMAL ACTIVIST: She has a right to know. She did this, five years ago, three weeks ago, and she&rsquo;s going to do it again.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: What do you want to say for the elephants and the movie you&rsquo;re making to save the elephants?</p>

<p>FOX: Well, what I would like to say is I would like to see sort after of a transformation or an evolution in the way that a lot of people view elephants in the way elephants are treated, particularly in captivity, in the entertainment industry, in circuses and zoos. The movie that we made is called, &ldquo;How I became an Elephant&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And truly about a 14-year-old girl who travels to Thailand to learn about elephants. She meets probably the person of elephant information across the globe. The name is Lek Chailert and she has an elephant sanctuary there in Thailand. A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize that there&rsquo;s really only been one way to train elephants from hundreds of thousands of years. It goes back. It is an Asian technique. To this day in 2011, we are using the same technique.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Is it cruel?</p>

<p>FOX: It is beyond cruel. It&rsquo;s beyond. It is completely barbaric and horrific. If you see an elephant in captivity, including a zoo, even if they&rsquo;re not doing a trick, they have probably been trained with these techniques.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Well, Juliette saves an elephant in this documentary. Her bravery is important because these horrific animals, well, they are innocent. Nobody can speak for them except human beings who care.</p>

<p>Check this out. It is called &ldquo;The Crash Box&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They were tied, maybe everything; tied the ear, the tail, the leg, and at the time maybe lost freedom. Moaning, screaming all night.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Where to help &#8212; all right, if you want to help, what do you do, Jorja?</p>

<p>FOX: You go to howibecameanelephant.com. You stop going to circuses and zoos. Sanctuaries are great. We have elephants in captivity that we&rsquo;re going to need to house. Go to a sanctuary and see them there. Don&rsquo;t support those kinds of industries. If you are in Thailand be very, very careful; there&rsquo;s over 300 trekking organizations in Thailand. Go to the right one.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: All right. We&rsquo;re going to leave it there. Love you Jorja.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: And you, of course, know Jorja Fox from &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. And there you are, Jorja Fox working on CSI as an investigator. You&rsquo;ve actually used some of the skills that you learned on the show to help you investigate the plight for elephants.</p>

<p>FOX: Yes. Indeed. Research is really the key. In that clip I&rsquo;m getting hammered by my new boss actually for being a renegade, which is not the first of probably the last time that will happen to me personally and on the show.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: You&rsquo;re an animal lover.</p>

<p>FOX: I am.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Things are changing in the world, aren&rsquo;t they, for animals?</p>

<p>FOX: Well, yes. And I&rsquo;m an environmentalist and a conservationist. And we&rsquo;re really at a critical, critical point. I mean if you look at the (INAUDIBLE) list of endangered animals, if we keep going the way we&rsquo;re going in another 50 years we really critically won&rsquo;t have a lot of the animals that we, as humans, need to survive on the planet. It&rsquo;s not fun and games anymore.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: I don&rsquo;t have any kids, you don&rsquo;t have any kids, but people who have kids want to have animals for them.</p>

<p>FOX: Yes. I would like us to be able to stay on this planet. I don&rsquo;t want to move it Mars. I would like to stay here and I&rsquo;d like &#8212;</p>

		<p>Julie Chen: Welcome back to &ldquo;The Talk&rdquo;. Our first guest is best known for her role as Sara Sidle on the hit CBS drama &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;. Take a look.</p>

<p>&rdquo;(clip from CSI)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julie: Please welcome Jorja Fox.</p>

<p>Jorja Fox: (walks in, waves to audience) Oh wow! (hugs hosts, sits down on the couch with Julie Chen, Sharon Osbourne and Sara Gilbert) I am so honored to be here, thanks for having me&hellip;</p>

<p>Julie: Oh, we&rsquo;re honored to have you.</p>

<p>Jorja: &hellip;I really am.</p>

<p>Sara Gilbert: So are you a good tipper?</p>

<p>Jorja: Oh my goodness. You know, I think that we all would like to think that we&rsquo;re really good tippers (laughs) you know? I did work in the service industry for quite a while in New York, before I was (airquotes) &#8216;acting full time&rsquo;, and so yeah, I do try to tip generously, even if the service is horrible. (laughs)</p>

<p>Sara: And get attention for it, like Leah [Remini]?</p>

<p>Jorja: (nods) Yep. (laughs) That&rsquo;s possible, yeah.</p>

<p>Julie: What&rsquo;s generously? Because like I&rsquo;m straight-forward 20% cause it&rsquo;s a little more than 15 and the math is easy, but I find that-</p>

<p>Jorja: The math is easy. (gestures at Julie)</p>

<p>Julie: -the math is easy.</p>

<p>Jorja: That&rsquo;s an important-</p>

<p>Julie: -but if I&rsquo;m with someone who like, I see is looking at, you know, when you&rsquo;re doing the math, they&rsquo;re just looking, I ntip up because I want them to think I&rsquo;m more generous than I am.</p>

<p>Jorja: (laughs) No.</p>

<p>Julie: -I&rsquo;m like, &#8216;yeah, throw on another ten bucks&rsquo;. Isn&rsquo;t that terrible? So what do you do? Do you do, what, the 20%?</p>

<p>Jorja: Yeah, usually a <em>minimum</em> of 20. Even if it&rsquo;s a big group, you know, with 18 [percent] included.</p>

<p>Sharon Osbourne: So many of us, especially in the industry that we&rsquo;re in now, we all started serving.</p>

<p>Jorja: (nods) Mm-hm.</p>

<p>Sharon: I mean, I did. And didn&rsquo;t do very well at it.</p>

<p>Jorja: Me either. (laughs at herself)</p>

<p>Sharon: But I always feel, I always feel bad because people think it&rsquo;s just an easy job, and it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a very difficult job to do it well.</p>

<p>Jorja: Absolutely.</p>

<p>Sharon: It&rsquo;s tough to be able to serve well.</p>

<p>Jorja: (gestures) And I think in Los Angeles, honestly, sometimes the service <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> so great, because people really are, their passion is something else.</p>

<p>Sharon: Yeah.</p>

<p>Jorja: And they&rsquo;re working to be a writer (ticks things off on her fingers), to be an actor,-</p>

<p>Sharon: Yeah.</p>

<p>Jorja: -to be a musician. So often yeah, you&rsquo;re, you, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have the best service you&rsquo;ve ever had in your whole life, but at the same time, I like supporting the arts-</p>

<p>Sharon: Me too.</p>

<p>Jorja: -so I tip. (laughs)</p>

<p>Julie: You, um, so you worked in the service industry, but were you a child actor, because you are such a wonderful actress.</p>

<p>Jorja: (smiles) Oh, that&rsquo;s so nice of you. Um, thank you.</p>

<p>(audience applause)</p>

<p>Julie: What were you like as a child?</p>

<p>Jorja: Um, the time. I <em>knew</em> I wanted to be an actor when I was five, and I, I grew up in a very very small coastal town in Florida, so, and, and every once in a while I think to myself, &#8216;well, I&rsquo;m living my life based (gestures with her hands) on a decision I made when I was five&rsquo; which is all so (gestures again) kind of interesting, I mean I-</p>

<p>Sara: Me too.</p>

<p>Jorja: -Yeah, yeah.-</p>

<p>Sara. It&rsquo;s weird.</p>

<p>Jorja: Like, &#8216;oh, okay, should I rethink that&rsquo; but, you know, &lsquo;cause acting&rsquo;s not really a grown-up job, I think, I play make-believe for a living, <em>but</em>, it&rsquo;s so rewarding still, I, I kinda decided y&rsquo;know as long as this is fun for me, I&rsquo;m gonna keep doing it. But, I was a chubby kid, um, my mom was a parent of the Depression, and to her, a, a great way to love her kids was to feed her kids, so I ate five times a day. And this was, uh, like late 70&rsquo;s, early 80&rsquo;s so I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, they, there was a really popular t-shirt called &#8216;Foxy Lady&rsquo; that everybody was wearing, you know the one, everybody wore one-</p>

<p>Julie: Kind of.</p>

<p>Jorja: Yeah. And my mom bought one for every day of the week, &lsquo;cause she thought this was amazing, &lsquo;cause my last name was Fox, and I was sent off to school in these &#8216;Foxy Lady&rsquo; t-shirts-</p>

<p>(laughter from audience)</p>

<p>Sara, Julie: Ohhhh&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: I learned some humility real, really young.</p>

<p>Sara: But then it all turned around, right, because you became a model&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: Weird.</p>

<p>Sara: Right.</p>

<p>Sharon: No, not with those legs it ain&rsquo;t, missy. Those&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: Thank you.</p>

<p>Sara: No, it&rsquo;s not weird now.</p>

<p>Jorja: I went to&hellip; we had built a mall in this small town, probably, you know, a couple of years, you know, I was about 14 when this mall showed up. So I&rsquo;m about fifteen and a half, and my mother told me I was hanging with the wrong circle of friends, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not to hang out with them any more, they were older than me, and they had cars, and we would go places that were a little further than my mother wanted me to go. So I arranged to meet these friends at the mall to say goodbye, to have a very dramatic goodbye with them, and I had been crying all morning, and, there was a modeling contest at the mall. It was the last thing that I wanted to do, but of course my friends were very fashion-forward and really cool, they&rsquo;re like, &#8216;well let&rsquo;s, you know, I know we&rsquo;re saying goodbye to you, but let&rsquo;s just join the modeling contest&rsquo;, and oddly, weirdly, strangely, I won. And again, you know, growing up in Florida in a small town, sort of the idea - you, you described this earlier (looking at Sharon) - what was beautiful in Florida was blonde, tanned,-</p>

<p>Sharon: Mm-hmm.</p>

<p>Jorja: -you know I was <em>none</em> of those things, I mean, um, obviously I&rsquo;m very fair-skinned, I&rsquo;m <em>taller</em> than most of the men even in Los Angeles, forget about the women-</p>

<p>(audience laughs)</p>

<p>Sharon: Most of the men I date, anyway.</p>

<p>Jorja: Some of them, yes. And, yeah, so winning this contest was the, the greatest fluke that ever happened to me, and my face was in the *paper</e,>, and the kids at school were like (covers her mouth briefly) &#8216;okay, chubby, Foxy Lady girl won the modeling contest?&lsquo;. Like-</p></p>

<p>Sharon: Never.</p>

<p>Jorja: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Julie: We&rsquo;ll have more with Jorja Fox when we come right back.</p>

<p>[commercial break]</p>

<p>Julie: Oh, we&rsquo;re on <em>this</em> camera - sorry. Maybe I should do television sometime. Hah hah. Welcome back to &ldquo;The Talk&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re having a conversation with Jorja Fox. Hello, hello, hello.</p>

<p>Jorja: Hello, hello.</p>

<p>Sharon: I wanted to ask you about the work that you do with Bob Barker because you do a lot of work for animal advo-</p>

<p>Jorja: Ahhh.</p>

<p>Sara: Advocacy.</p>

<p>Sharon: Thank you.</p>

<p>Jorja: That&rsquo;s a tough one, right?</p>

<p>Sharon: I can&rsquo;t get it, I can never get it out.</p>

<p>Jorja: Um, I had the honor and pleasure of working with Bob this spring-</p>

<p>Sharon: He is amazing.</p>

<p>Jorja: He is. He is a force to be reckoned with. And he funded the transport of 25 lions from Bolivia, ex-circus lions, to a wildlife sanctuary north of Denver, Colorado. This has never been done before, 25 lions have never gotten on a plane and, and been taken somewhere else-</p>

<p>Sharon: Wow.</p>

<p>Jorja: -in connection with an organization called ADI. And basically, Bolivia outlawed their travelling circuses, which is a thing that&rsquo;s sort of happening all over the world, and they didn&rsquo;t have the infrastructure afterwards to, to provide sort of decent, compassionate homes for these animals. So the wildlife animal sanctuary in Colorado took all 25 of them, and now they have <em>80 acres</em> to share-</p>

<p>(audience cheers, applauds)</p>

<p>Sharon: That must give you tremendous satisfaction.</p>

<p>Jorja: You know, on a personal level it really does, and then, you know, it stems, like I&rsquo;m an environmentalist, I care about the planet, and, and these <em>great</em> land mammals that we have are, are falling off the planet at a very fast, fast pace, and&hellip; so for me my commitment is habitat for them, to keep the wild places wild, and the animals that are in captivity that we <em>already</em> have, let&rsquo;s take good care of them, I think they deserve it. So&hellip;</p>

<p>Julie: What I, actually, but what I also hear about you is that you love to play games. (Jorja smiles) So we have a little game for you.</p>

<p>Jorja: Uh-oh.</p>

<p>Julie: You have to get up and switch seats with me.</p>

<p>Jorja: All right.</p>

<p>Julie: Okay.</p>

<p>(they switch seats)</p>

<p>Jorja: Very exciting.</p>

<p>Julie: This is a little game that we call &#8216;Jorja On My Mind&rsquo;.</p>

<p>(audience applause)</p>

<p>Julie: (hands Jorja a red headband)</p>

<p>Jorja: Any game that involves a headband, something I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>

<p>Julie: Put the headband on with the velcro facing out and here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>

<p>Jorja: (puts on the headband, straightens her hair)</p>

<p>Julie: I have a stack of cards-</p>

<p>Jorja: I do uh, all [Jimmy] Fallon or Bjork style?</p>

<p>Sara: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Jorja: Cool. (makes a funny face)</p>

<p>Sara: Wait, pull the hair down a little&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: Pull it down a little? (adjusts her hair)</p>

<p>Sara: The hair, there we go.</p>

<p>(Jorja and Sara laugh)</p>

<p>Julie: This stack of cards is a picture of a celebrity. We&rsquo;re going to give you clues as to who you&rsquo;re wearing on your forehead, and-</p>

<p>Jorja: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Julie: -and like you, Jorja Fox, they too have the name of an animal in their name, but it might be the first name. Okay, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the last name.</p>

<p>Jorja: Okay.</p>

<p>Julie: But it could be, either-or.</p>

<p>Jorja: Can I get hints from the audience?</p>

<p>Julie: No.</p>

<p>(audience &#8216;awwws&rsquo;, Jorja looks around)</p>

<p>Sharon: No.</p>

<p>Julie: No, you only get hints, we&rsquo;re going to take turns giving you hints,</p>

<p>Jorja: Okay.</p>

<p>Julie: If you don&rsquo;t want one, you can pass and we&rsquo;ll go on to the next one.</p>

<p>Jorja: Okay.</p>

<p>Julie: Okay, and if you get five right in 45 seconds, everyone in the audience goes home with a &ldquo;Talk&rdquo; t-shirt (holds up the t-shirt).</p>

<p>(audience applause)</p>

<p>Julie: 45 seconds on the clock, please!</p>

<p>Jorja: No pressure there&hellip;</p>

<p>Julie: The most famous golfer in the world, cheated on his wife.</p>

<p>Jorja: Tiger Woods.</p>

<p>Julie: Allegedly!</p>

<p>Julie: Go, Sharon.</p>

<p>Sharon: Singer, songwriter, beautiful, blonde&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: Male, female?</p>

<p>Sharon: Gorgeous blonde lady!</p>

<p>Jorja: Okay.</p>

<p>Sharon: Gorgeous!</p>

<p>Sara: If it makes you happy.</p>

<p>Jorja: Sheryl Crow!</p>

<p>Julie: Sara, go!</p>

<p>Sara: Okay, he&rsquo;s a singer married to Heidi Klum, it&rsquo;s on a rose, an animal&hellip;</p>

<p>Jorja: Oh, Seal!</p>

<p>Julie: Okay, the most famous Tibetan monk.</p>

<p>Jorja: Dalai Lama.</p>

<p>(audience starts counting down the clock)</p>

<p>Sharon: You&rsquo;re good at this! She thinks she&rsquo;s Angelina Jolie.</p>

<p>Sara: Married to Brian Austin Greene.</p>

<p>(clock counts down to zero)</p>

<p>Sara: She once transformed into each other- (buzzer sounds)</p>

<p>Jorja: (makes a face) Augh!</p>

<p>Julie: She has the same last name as you.</p>

<p>Jorja: Megan Fox.</p>

<p>Julie: You know what, everyone goes home with a t-shirt! (Julie and Jorja hug; Jorja bangs into Julie&rsquo;s chin) Jorja Fox!</p>

<p>Julie: You can see &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; every Thursday night at 9 o&rsquo;clock right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p>(as the camera cuts away, Julie points to her chin)</p>

<p>Jorja: I&rsquo;m so sorry about that.</p>

<p>TIM PHILLIPS, ANIMAL DEFENDERS INTERNATIONAL: These lions have lived their life in a tiny, rusting, disgusting cage on the back of a lorry. Tomorrow they&rsquo;re going to feel the wind blow in their face. They&rsquo;re going to feel grass beneath their feet. They&rsquo;re going to roam into the bushes. They&rsquo;re going to do whatever they want. They&rsquo;re going to be as lions, possibly for the first real time in their lives.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Tonight, an unprecedented flight to freedom for 25 magnificent animals. Bravo. Abused lions rescued from hideous conditions in Bolivia are now living out their lives in an amazing Colorado sanctuary. Last week&rsquo;s operation was the largest ever rescue of its kind. It could not have been done without the help of two amazing animal-loving celebrity who join me right here on ISSUES tonight. I&rsquo;m talking about my dear friends and my heroes, Bob Barker and Jorja Fox.</p>

<p>Now, when Jorja is not busy solving murders on CSI &#8212; come on, how many episodes have you seen her on, right? This time she is investigating real life crimes against animals.</p>

<p>And of course, Bob Barker is a legend from &ldquo;The Price is Right&rdquo; fame. You know, he is my hero because he helped pay for this massive rescue mission. I think he gave something like $200,000. He is an amazing, amazing hero for the animals and he&rsquo;s long time vegetarian and just an activist all the way around for these animals.</p>

<p>Listen to this.</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>BOB BARKER, ANIMAL ACTIVITIES: Help control the pet population, have your pet spayed or neutered.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. Have your pet spayed and neutered. That&rsquo;s his famous line.</p>

<p>Straight out to my dear friends: Jorja Fox and Bob Barker; Jorja, going to start with you. First of all, bravo to all of you, to both of you and the organizations involved for getting these animals out.</p>

<p>Tell us about the conditions that these poor, poor lions have endured for their entire lives. What did you get them out of, Jorja?</p>

<p>JORJA FOX, ANIMAL ACTIVIST: Jane, thank you so much for having us. Again it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be with you.</p>

<p>To give you a few examples we had eight lions, a pride of lions, a whole family living together. This is adult lions, living on the back of a truck, the size of two double beds. That&rsquo;s one example of the conditions of these animals.</p>

<p>Another lion had been in a very small zoo cage for 11 years; hadn&rsquo;t seen another lion in all of that time. Two other lions had never seen another lion before; they were kept in small cages in circuses all by themselves.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Some of these lions, literally as you just heard, never set foot outside a small, filthy cage. Now, take a look at these conditions. No surprise that many were malnourished, stressed and traumatized. But within days of being rescued they were healthier, they were less aggressive, they had shiny coats even. Listen to this.</p>

<p>Bob Barker, again, you gave $200,000 to help make this happen. You are my hero. What runs through you emotionally when you see these animals taken from this hellish situation and put in this fabulous sanctuary where they literally have a 15,000 square foot biosphere to live out their lives as if in nature? Bob.</p>

<p>All right. Jorja, went to take that one?</p>

<p>FOX: Yes, I just wanted you to know that the biosphere is actually temporary. It is 15,000 square it, it has heat, it&rsquo;s got grass inside, it has toys. This is merely a space for the lions to acclimate to the Denver climate.</p>

<p>In a couple months they will have 80 full acres to share there. The animal sanctuary, a wild animal sanctuary north of Denver has two other lion prides. And it was a surprise to me to find out that lions actually are genetically wired for winter as they traversed Africa they spent a lot of time in the mountains in northern Africa, it gets very cold. So this will be a great place for them. But because they&rsquo;re just out of Bolivia they&rsquo;re going to stay a little warmer until the weather warms up a bit.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: well, I want to go to my big issue. I got to say, zoos are basically prisons. Ok. That is my opinion. It is easy to criticize other nations where zoos are terrible.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about the United States. We have countless animals, like Billy the elephant, he is the subject of a huge battle. He is stuck in concrete enclosure at the L.A. Zoo with no companion. See the way they&rsquo;re rocking like that. That is a sign of distress.</p>

<p>These animals are not meant to live this way, Bob Barker. What would you say to anybody who goes to a zoo?</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, let me say first, that I have heard nothing that has been said thus far. So, I don&rsquo;t know what you have asked me. I understand you&rsquo;ve been talking.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL:L Tell me about the zoos, Bob, come on. Tell us about the zoos and why you are against them?</p>

<p>BARKER: I am against zoos. I consider them prisons for animals. And the Los Angeles Zoo has kept that poor Billy out there for years, alone with &#8212;</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: More after the break. More Bob.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We certainly couldn&rsquo;t have done it without your help, Mr. Barker.</p>

<p>BARKER: Line number one, come on down.</p>

<p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Yes. This is an amazing story, the largest airlift of lions ever, thanks to Bob Barker, of &ldquo;Price is Right&rdquo; fame; a second chance at life for 25 beautiful lions. They spent their entire lives in filthy cages as part of really deplorable Bolivian circuses and we&rsquo;re going to show you that video as we talk.</p>

<p>Bob Barker, the Bolivians aren&rsquo;t really the bad guys here because they&rsquo;re actually way ahead of us. They&rsquo;ve actually passed a law that the United States needs to pass. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, the ADI people went undercover and they collected such horrendous tape on the treatment of animals in Bolivia that the government actually passed this legislation that banned circuses that used any animals, even domestic animals. They are banned in Bolivia.</p>

<p>And after that legislation was passed, with other wildlife organizations, ADI went out and gathered up lions and other animals of all kinds and the lions, they brought to the United States, 25 beautiful lions.</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Jorja why don&rsquo;t we do this in the United States? We just showed you video of Billy, the elephant at the L.A. Zoo. We could put him up again. You could tell he is in distress, he&rsquo;s rocking back and forth. There&rsquo;s been, I don&rsquo;t know how many legal battles over this elephant. They want to keep that elephant.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a sanctuary that&rsquo;s dying to take him. There he is. Look, when they rock back and forth like that, that shows that they are not happy, they are in distress, this poor guy on concrete.</p>

<p>Now, Bolivia is ahead of the United States. Why the heck, when we have the video here, this animal is not happy, we cannot get this animal freed to go to a sanctuary?</p>

<p>JORJA: Well, Jane, I want to say, you know Billy is an amazing example of just how horrible zoos can be for animals. He is not the exception, you know. Billy&rsquo;s story is a very, very common story. He happens to be one of the more famous elephants out there.</p>

<p>I think it is coming to the United States. I think that the more people find out what&rsquo;s going on and also examples, it is a true testament to the Bolivian people what they were able to accomplish very quickly. And when you hear a success story like that and you see that it can actually be done, and you see these lions moving to a sanctuary, it brings it all into the realm of the possible.</p>

<p>I think in the United States, we are going to see a movement like this becoming more and more powerful over the next couple of years. It&rsquo;s a long time coming. And I believe in the goodness of people. This lion expedition was really for the lions and about the lions.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, it was a true testament to the human spirit and what people can accomplish when they work together to make something great happen; so many people stepped forward.</p>

<p>(CROSSTALK)</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: Absolutely. Yes. And I want to thank some of the organizations. You can help the lions as well by supporting the amazing groups that were involved and made this happen, check out Animal Defenders International, you can go to AD-International.org. You can also visit wildanimalsanctuary.org and make a donation and get involved.</p>

<p>Listen, Bob Barker, I am going to give you the last word. You are just a hero. What would you say to Americans about zoos?</p>

<p>BARKER: Well, I think that the progressive, well-informed zoos are already closing their elephant exhibits. I would like to see them close all of the big animal exhibits. I think that the sooner that there are &#8212;</p>

<p>VELEZ-MITCHELL: We are out of time. I love both of you. Thank you.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
