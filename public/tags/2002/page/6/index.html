		<p>We go &ldquo;undercover&rdquo; with C.S.I&rsquo;s Jorja Fox. By which we mean we dress her in crazy getups and ask her silly questions. It&rsquo;s our m.o.!</p>

<p>Silver Lake, California, 3:19 on a sunny afternoon at the dog park, about a softball pitch away from downtown L.A.: I was scheduled to meet Jorja Fox at 3 P.M. and follow her around with a tape recorder while she walked her dogs. Just when I start to think, This sucks, I see a sprightly, tank-topped, ponytailed woman come bounding through the gates. It&rsquo;s her Jorja Fox! And I was just beginning to feel like a creep sitting in this place without a dog. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m late! You must have felt like a creep sitting in this place alone without a dog&rdquo;, she says. &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;, I say. After stints on ER and The West Wing, Jorja Fox is now riding high atop the crest of the hit CBS series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. And with a role in last year&rsquo;s indie-film sensation Memento, the lovely Ms. Fox is proving that she&rsquo;s a lucky charm of sorts - or at least something I&rsquo;d like to have draped around my neck. On CSI she plays a scientist who must find the answers to many bizarre and often sordid questions. I decided to turn the tables on her. It&rsquo;s funny seeing her there - you know, under the table.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Your character on CSI knows a thing or two about crime scenes. What sort of things should we watch out for if we murdered someone and didn&rsquo;t want to be linked to the crime? Theoretically, of course.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Well, I definitely think you should not murder anyone, under any circumstances - ever!</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> It&rsquo;s a little late for that right now.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I would say call the paramedics first then call the cops. If you can&rsquo;t do that, then just cover your entire body in latex and get rid of the corpse and you&rsquo;ll probably get away with it.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> How should I get rid of the body?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> A piranha fish tank is my personal pick.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> When a director asks you to be angry, do you think of the time the neighborhood bully threw your pet turtle down a well.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Anger is very easy for me. The hardest thing a director could ever ask me to do is cry. That&rsquo;s when I become super-actory. I have to go in a corner and psyche myself up for it. I think I&rsquo;m kind of an angry person. Anger is something I identify with. For better or worse.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the strangest outfit you like to put on when nobody else is home?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Well, my friend who works for the city left his uniform at my house one night and didn&rsquo;t come back, so I tried on this whole weird sort of construction thing with a tool belt. That&rsquo;s pretty kinky.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Let&rsquo;s say I showed up at your house on a typical Sunday morning, flashed my badge and dusted the headboard of your bed for fingerprints. How many different sets would I find?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Fingers and toes?. Probably only five or six right now.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> That&rsquo;s a big headboard.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I sleep on the floor, by the way.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> In preparation for the weekend, have you ever stolen a set of handcuffs or rubber gloves from the set?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Rubber gloves always comes in handy. I don&rsquo;t use handcuffs on the show, but there&rsquo;s probably a set in my house.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> When someone creepy sidles up to you at a bar, how do you get rid of him?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t really happen to me. I might have that weird-radar, because people who talk to me are almost never creepy. I&rsquo;m really lucky that way. You&rsquo;ve gotta wonder what kind of vibe you&rsquo;re putting out there if you&rsquo;re having really creepy people come talk to you.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the worst pickup line you&rsquo;ve ever heard that used your last name?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Maybe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling very sly, and I know &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re a Fox that you&rsquo;d want to make it with me&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> I don&rsquo;t even get it. How do you respond to something like that?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> If I have a drink in my hand, sometimes it accidentally falls in the direction of the person. If somebody&rsquo;s nice enough to come up to me and be interested in me, it&rsquo;s almost always a really cool thing. Unless they&rsquo;re really gross about it. I haven&rsquo;t gone home with anybody who tried to pick me up in a long time.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Would you say you&rsquo;re crazy like a fox, or is your last name nothing but a lie?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Until I was 14 years old, I was really fat - I was obese. And I have this gap between my teeth. At that time, it was twice the size - you could put a quarter through it - and I had freckles. My mom bought FOXY GIRL T-shirts - which were big, sort of, in the 70&rsquo;s - for every day of the week, and I had to wear one every day. It was kind of brutal. It was very difficult to live up to that. The whole &ldquo;foxy&rdquo; thing is funny, because for most of my life it was so not true. It was like a reverse joke. But, yeah, I&rsquo;m crazy. I&rsquo;m totally crazy. It&rsquo;s true. All of my family members are crazy, too. There&rsquo;s a lot in a name.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What&rsquo;s the strangest thing you&rsquo;ve ever gotten stuck in that gap between your front teeth?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I&rsquo;d have to say rocks. A couple of rocks, I was camping, it was dark, I was caught up in the moment and I got some rocks in my teeth.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Rocks. Your face was in the dirt?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Gently, but yes.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What are some of your vices, besides the cigarette you&rsquo;re smoking right now?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Ha! Well, I stay up really late, I drink coffee and alcohol and I like to be bad. Bad! But I don&rsquo;t have so many vices.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> What kind of drink could I buy you?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> A beer. I would really be impressed. A bottle of beer. Nice beer - a microbrew. No glass. Amber is my favorite.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> You play guitar: Have you ever gone to a store and tried out a new guitar by playing &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> No, but I do know how to play &ldquo;Stairway to Heaven&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen people do that. Once or twice I&rsquo;ve even taken them outside and let them know that it&rsquo;s probably not all that cool.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> You&rsquo;re a self-described liberal. Will you use your fame to save the world?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Wow! I would sure love to try.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Where would you start?</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> Honestly? Two places: the environment, to be very serious, and sex.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Sex.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> I think &ldquo;Make love, not war&rdquo; might be the most profound statement that&rsquo;s ever been made. If people were spending more time having sex, they&rsquo;d be a lot less inclined to be violent.</p>

<p><strong>STUFF:</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>JORJA:</strong> You&rsquo;re not going to ask me what my favorite dildo is or something?</p>

		<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong>: Although it now may seem hard to believe, it was just two years ago the hit drama &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; barely made it on to the primetime schedule. The show has since become a hit with an unusual look at forensic investigators who solve crimes with science.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> The stars of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; are William Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan, Jorja Fox and Paul Guilfoyle. Good morning, everybody.</p>

<p>(EVERYONE): Good morning, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Show of hands. Who thought this show was gonna be a hit? &ldquo;(Everyone but Jorja raises their hands.)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Oh, come on!</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> It was the script. See, it was the material&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Absolutely. No doubt in my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> A hit. We knew it was gonna be good, but I think that no one expected it.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We didn&rsquo;t know it was gonna be, you know, 25, 28 million people watching.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We didn&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> &ldquo;(jokingly)&rdquo; And I think everything I do is gonna be a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, it&rsquo;s the one next to you &ldquo;(pointing to Jorja)&rdquo; that seems to be the good luck charm. I mean, regular on &ldquo;[[ER]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;[[The West Wing|West Wing]],&rdquo; regular on &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; Sign you up in the making!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Thank you. I didn&rsquo;t think the show was gonna be a hit. I think I was the only one that didn&rsquo;t. I had so much hope and faith and so much belief in &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; but I really wasn&rsquo;t quite sure we were gonna stay on the air, but I was really happy&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Why not?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Well, I think it was a hard pitch at first for a lot of people. We were last to go at everything. Last to get picked up, like you said. And talking about death and science.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Hair fibers are a major element of the thing, and fingerprints. It was a question of how well we were gonna be able to translate that to the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Well, usually audiences are turned off by things that are about death, that are bloody, that are macabre. What are they responding to in this case?</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> Well, I think that the professionalism of the people. I think all drama is about people and interaction and I think they&rsquo;re really responding to all of us as a group. However we all cemented together is, I think, what people are responding to.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re all just working people, I mean, on the show and we operate in our jobs the way people go to work and operate in their jobs. We&rsquo;re very technical, very proficient, and I think it&rsquo;s interesting to watch the process. I think people enjoy watching the process of us put the science to the crime and solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But most of the time, people view people who are engaged with science as nerds. How are nerds turned into heroes?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> We&rsquo;re nerds. We just have better clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> I think also that the plot, that crime is the antagonist of our show. So, you watch this group of dedicated professionals try to come up against or conflict with the crime itself. So I think that&rsquo;s what takes it away from the nerd thing is because of what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> How much do you really know, any of you, about forensics?</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> We&rsquo;re getting to know more and more everyday. I mean, I knew very little when we began.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I don&rsquo;t leave my fingerprints on anything.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> No, I do. I think about that all the time, whether or not I need to put on a pair of gloves or not.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Come on!</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> I do!</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Every couple of months, we get better and better, at least, at being able to use the tools and being able to know what the tools are used for. I&rsquo;m certain now if we came across a crime scene, we would at least know how to secure it.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> Well, for instance, sometimes they&rsquo;ll do shots that don&rsquo;t include us, like tape-lifting prints from something and it would have been an added shot. And I saw this on an episode recently and my character was supposed to be doing it and I actually did it on the master. And then I saw the close-up and it was not my print. And it was so sloppy. And I felt like I wanna be doing my own inserts now because it was done&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> I&rsquo;m gonna ask you, look, the show is fiction, but is the science [exact]? I mean, is that the one thing you never tamper with?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> The science is all real. The stuff we use is real, and the way we use it is all real.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And I think some of the crimes are all real. They&rsquo;re based on real crimes. There&rsquo;s a lot of crime out there, unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Marg Helgenberger</strong> The process is sped up.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> You&rsquo;re never hurting for story lines.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Unfortunately.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Yeah, it is unfortunate. Talk to me about the collaborative effort of this. I mean, as I look at all of you, you&rsquo;ve all had individual achievements and have been primary players in something else. Is it something where you have to check your ego at the door of a show like this?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> I think that&rsquo;s the wise thing to do with all work. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a long day. It&rsquo;s a long day if you don&rsquo;t. And the great thing about this show, and I think in this case we&rsquo;re different than a lot of &ldquo;hit&rdquo; television shows in that our writers, our producers, our actors, our crew, even all the way to the network, we are very collaborative. It&rsquo;s not just one person&rsquo;s decision, as many hit television shows are. They come from one voice. We have a whole lot of people that work very hard all day long with each other to try and make this stuff work.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Do you get involved in the plot lines, the story lines? You&rsquo;re making a face there, Jorja. Yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. We do.</p>

<p><strong>Gary Dourdan</strong> Somewhat, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &#8216;Cause we&rsquo;re dedicated. So, I don&rsquo;t know. Sometimes even for better for worse, I don&rsquo;t know if everybody always wants to hear from us, but they always act like they do. And they let us talk and they listen to us a lot, which is very kind of them.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> And acting is kind of the detailed work, almost like the way forensics is and in the course of the process of creating a television show, the acting is kind of the final touchstone of reality, and so I think that&rsquo;s where we all have our own unique experiences.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> In the final moments we&rsquo;ve got left the show is now going to have a spin-off. How uncomfortable are all of you with that?</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> As actors, I think anytime something else comes along to try and compare to your stuff, you get a little queasy about it.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> But you have the same people and they now have their attention split.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Here&rsquo;s the deal. It&rsquo;s a very successful show and the network is &hellip; and what &ldquo;Law and Order&rdquo; has done to television is a remarkable thing and I think that CBS is interested in some of that.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Guilfoyle</strong> That&rsquo;s a very provocative question, by the way, Bryant.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> We&rsquo;ll have to pursue it during the commercial. Guys, thanks very much and congratulations.</p>

<p><strong>William Petersen</strong> Congratulations to you. Great job all these years.</p>

<p><strong>Bryant Gumbel</strong> Thanks, Bill. The season finale of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; airs tomorrow night at 9, of course, here on CBS. We&rsquo;re back in a moment, right after this.</p>

		<p><strong>CSI Star MIA at ER Funeral</strong></p>

<p>On tonight&rsquo;s ER ? airing 10 pm/ET on NBC ? many ex-cast members are expected to return for the farewell of Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). Who? Exec producer John Wells has kept that info under tight wraps. But we can tell you who won&rsquo;t be there: CSI star Jorja Fox, who played lesbian lady doc Maggie Doyle from 1996-99.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did call a couple of weeks ago asking if Maggie Doyle could go to Dr. Greene&rsquo;s funeral,&rdquo; Fox tells TV Guide Online. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to do it because I was working that day for CSI. They invited a tremendous amount of people who worked on ER throughout the years ? it&rsquo;s going to be one of the saddest shows on TV. I was sad I couldn&rsquo;t go because Maggie loved Dr. Greene!</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were free that day, I would&rsquo;ve courtesy-called CBS,&rdquo; she wants to assure fans. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they would&rsquo;ve responded, but they probably would&rsquo;ve let me go.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Fox just wrapped taping CSI&rsquo;s second season in Las Vegas. She looks forward to tonight&rsquo;s episode ? airing 9 pm/ET ? which introduces David Caruso and Emily Procter&rsquo;s characters, who&rsquo;ll be in the CSI: Miami spin-off this fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honestly, every time I think I&rsquo;m over it, they remind me how disturbing our show is,&rdquo; Fox ? who plays lab-rat Sara ? hints. &ldquo;Two upcoming episodes are the grossest ones we&rsquo;ve had on. This summer break will be nice. I&rsquo;ll do things where the sun is shining, and I&rsquo;m not going to be interested in dead people at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So far, leading lady Marg Helgenberger has snagged most of CSI&rsquo;s awards show nods ? but has Fox any Emmy hopes for herself? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thrilled for Marg; she&rsquo;s brilliant,&rdquo; the 33-year-old says. &ldquo;I would be a liar if I said I didn&rsquo;t have hopes for an acting nomination. Everybody does.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The character Sara is ten gazillion times more courageous than I am. You know, we do things sometimes and me, Jorja, in between takes is like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this, I can&rsquo;t do this. Let&rsquo;s make sure, we need to be careful, where&rsquo;s the medic?&rdquo; And then the camera&rsquo;s start rolling and Sara Sidle kinda just goes in and does it. We did a helicopter scene. This year George Eads and I had a scene where we were rappelling out of a helicopter.</p>

<p>The intent is not to be gratuitous. At the same time, because the show is so visual and we can go places with that, there&rsquo;s moments where we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology! So you want to have that opportunity if you can. Yeah, it shows up very heavily in the scripts. Sometimes the scripts are- I can&rsquo;t read the scripts late at night. I have to read them earlier in the day or I don&rsquo;t sleep very well.</p>

<p>I have so much respect and admiration for the folks who do this. You can show up every day and try and figure out what has happened. There&rsquo;s sort of that quote we have on the show, that we meet people on the worst day of their lives, and take things from there and try to provide, at the very least, some closure.</p>

<p>Sara Sidle is not squeamish. She&rsquo;s very cerebral, and she lives for what she does. And I think she can become emotional affected by what she&rsquo;s experiencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of her ability to be there, to be present.</p>
