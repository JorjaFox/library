		<p>One person&rsquo;s death is another person&rsquo;s breath. That&rsquo;s something Jorja Fox knows everything about. The part of a forensic investigator on the television show C.S.I. has introduced her to a large audience. We talked to the American actress about her own life and her love/hate-relationship with death.</p>

<p>That she would ever be standing next to dead bodies that aren&rsquo;t even cold yet, for a living, surprises Jorja more than anyone. The thirty-three year old actress slowly but surely made her way up to Hollywood. Thanks to relatively small, but outstanding roles in shows like &#8216;ER&rsquo; and &#8216;West Wing&rsquo;, Jorja has managed to make a name for herself. When you get to know her a bit better, you will find that Jorja is just as unconventional as the characters she portrayed throughout the years. In &#8216;ER&rsquo;, she played Maggie Doyle (&ldquo;I was a lesbian, but still had a mouth as sharp as a machinegun.&rdquo;), she was in the famous coming-out-episode of &#8216;Ellen&rsquo;, in &#8216;West Wing&rsquo; she was seen as a clever cop and in the movie &#8216;Memento&rsquo; she portrayed Guy Pierce&rsquo;s dead wife. (&ldquo;Even the actors didn&rsquo;t know what that movie was about when they started it.&rdquo;)</p>

<p><strong>Foxy Woman</strong></p>

<p>Now, every week in C.S.I., she stoops over the strangled, the shot, the stabbed and the other gruesomely murdered. Not bad for a girl that, for a long time, lived a gypsy&rsquo;s life with her parents, an Irishman and a Belgian woman who moved to the States just before Jorja was born. &ldquo;My parents were incredibly restless,&rdquo; she says about that period in her life. &ldquo;My mother needed to move every other year. If possible to another country, but if there was no other possibility, we would just move into the house on the other side of the street.&rdquo; The only constant factor in the Fox family was mom&rsquo;s cooking; she put five meals together every day. As a result, Jorja weighed about 140 pounds at the age of twelve. &ldquo;I was huge,&rdquo; Jorja exclaims. &ldquo;I was horribly bullied in school. And if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough already, my mother bought me this whole stack of oversized t-shirts that said &#8216;Foxy Woman&rsquo;. I felt miserable.&rdquo; She finally lost the extra weight as the result of a long term crush. &ldquo;That was the first time I realised you can eat three meals a day, instead of five. That was a revelation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her new slender figure, she felt confident enough to enter the Miss Melbourne Beach beauty peageant in Florida, where she lived at the time. And what nobody expected, happened: Jorja won. &ldquo;Picture me standing there; stick thin, pale and with dark hair, when all the other girls were voluptuous, tanned blondes.&rdquo; Her triumph gave her enough confidence to register with a professional modeling agency. It turned out to be the beginning of a wonderful period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to be a model. It&rsquo;s good pay, you get to travel all over the world and you meet lots of different people,&rdquo; Jorja says. But her ambitions went beyond the lens of the photocamera. She took actinglessons, started her own theater production company Honeypot and went to as many auditions as she could. But the biggest step turned out to be moving from New York to Los Angeles. &ldquo;I thought LA would be terrible,&rdquo; Jorja says, laughing. &ldquo;To me, it was a city for people who are willing to sell their soul to the devil, just to become a star. But by now, I&rsquo;ve figured out that that&rsquo;s nonsense. I met a lot of warm and sensitive people here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t much later though that Jorja had to deal with some rough times. Just when her career started to take off, her mother died of cancer. &ldquo;I was really depressed, but at the same time I was doing better than ever, professionally. At a time like that, all you can do is make the best you can of your life. It&rsquo;s useless to keep looking back at the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Weak stomach</strong></p>

<p>For the role of Sara Sidle in C.S.I., which is set in Las Vegas, Jorja regularly resides in a dried out desert in California, where a set is build. Staying over there has brought the cast closer together. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to do there,&rdquo; Jorja explains. &ldquo;So we really don&rsquo;t have any other choice than to go grab a beer in the evenings. We talk about ourselves, but also about the job. At first, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure whether they were going to let me stay, since they only asked me for three episodes. I made about two hundred dollars for one episode!&rdquo; In spite of the often gaunt storylines of the show, the colleagues have a lot of fun in between (or during) scenes. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fascinating, all those dead bodies with outrageous injuries. There&rsquo;s something grotesque about death.&rdquo; And even though her co-actor William Petersen states that Jorja doesn&rsquo;t even have the stomach to look at those injuries, as far as Jorja&rsquo;s concerned, the show could use even more death and decay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pushed my limits on many ocassions. There have been a couple of episodes that really walked the line in picturing brutal violence. But I don&rsquo;t have any boundaries. The more &#8216;gore&rsquo;, the better. And a little more sex in the show wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad idea, either! I think it would be kinda exciting actually, out there in the morgue.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Personal file</strong></p>

<p>Name: Jorja-An Fox, Jorjan for short. She changed it to Jorja later.</p>

<p>Date of Birth: July 7th, 1968, in New York.</p>

<p>Curriculum Vitae: Jorja starred in &#8216;ER&rsquo;, &#8216;West Wing&rsquo;, and had a small part in Memento.</p>

<p>Fun facts: Jorja has been a vegetarian for years and wants to become a vegan one day. She owns a boxer named Ali, and two cats, Sid and Rumplestiltskin.</p>

<p>Civil Status: Is dating an actor who&rsquo;s name she won&rsquo;t mention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&rdquo; was a TV Talk show/variety show, hosted by Craig Kilborn.</p>

<h2 id="transcript:c902db5878260160d5668aa316d27c31">Transcript</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Can I, can I just say something?</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> You may say something.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Something that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to say, perhaps on national television. Ding dong, you son of a bitch. Ding dong.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That was good, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It was great!</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s exciting, seeing Buddy Hackett.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It was, and I just met him outside.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Did he talk your ear off? Did he tell you a dirty joke? What did he do?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> He told me that he&rsquo;s a police officer. And I got nervous.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Oh really. Why would you get nervous? Meeting a cop?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I don&rsquo;t know, I just, I don&rsquo;t meet a lot of police officers on the Craig Kilborn show. I didn&rsquo;t know if it was a set up, something&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> There&rsquo;s nothing in your dressing room, is there?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No. No, no.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Okay, last time you were on here was one year ago.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes! As a matter of fact.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> To the day, or something to that effect.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yes, it&rsquo;s maybe quite possible our anniversary.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Of you being on the show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Actually, I brought you a little something.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> You brought me a gift? You didn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s an anniversary present. And um, you know the 1-year anniversary I was just told is paper, so I brought you a paper.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> The L.A. Times.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Because it&rsquo;s an L.A. story.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> This is the second one I got today. This is very nice.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Do you read that?</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Yeah, I get it at my door. Um, your name - your name is Jorja Fox. Is in fact -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> My name.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> No, no, is your nickname though Foxy? Do people call you Foxy? Tell me they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No, they don&rsquo;t really. No, they do. I mean, usually when they do &hellip; I mean, it&rsquo;s a nickname I had when I was a kid and -</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s understandable.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Because there was the whole thing about the Foxy Girl thing. And they were making t-shirts about Foxy Girl and stickers and bumper stickers and stuff like that.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> About what Foxy Girl? Just in general?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Just Foxy Girl as a thing, you know. Like, you know, &ldquo;Have a good day.&rdquo; You know, it was just kind of a thing that happened. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe where I&rsquo;m from.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Where was this?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> A small coastal town in Florida. It was a small town.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> There was a whole thing about Foxy Girls there?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Does anybody remember that? The Foxy Girl thing with the t-shirts? [Audience cheers, applause] But I wasn&rsquo;t foxy at all.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> You were not foxy?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No I wasn&rsquo;t. And my mother bought me a t-shirt for every day of the week. Because my last name was Fox and she thought that was really funny. And she would send me out into the world and I would get, you know, attacked and beaten.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> So, mom&rsquo;s funny &hellip; or not funny.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah mom&rsquo;s very funny, she&rsquo;s very funny. And usually they call me Foxy at work when I bend over in a parking garage, you know, with latex gloves on, looking for blood spatter. Something like that. That&rsquo;s usually when I get, &ldquo;Hey, Foxy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Oh, you mean when you&rsquo;re taping CSI?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, at work.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> They call you Foxy?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s a teasing thing.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> What did they say about you in Stuff magazine?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh, that&rsquo;s not me.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Not on the cover.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No, no, I mean in the magazine.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> This is, this is &hellip; What do you think? Was it hard to say yes to do this or was it fun? Did you wanna do it or?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> You know, I was really surprised and shocked that I was invited to do it, actually. And I was interested in it. I went to work and I said to the guys, I was like, &ldquo;You know, what do you think about Stuff magazine? Do you think that would be something that would be good to do?&rdquo; And their lips started to move and they got these really strange looks on their faces and I was like, no, I don&rsquo;t know if I can really do this. They got too excited about it. I was like, &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Well, yours are different than the other photos because you are, like, wearing wigs and outfits.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. It was, I had an amazing time and for someone like myself, because, like I said, I couldn&rsquo;t believe I was invited to do it. I was really happy to do it. I don&rsquo;t think somebody like me would normally get to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Oh, what do you mean someone like you? You&rsquo;re tall and lovely. What are you talking about?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Well, thank you. I don&rsquo;t, you know, I just don&rsquo;t think of myself as like that kind, that girl that gets in magazines for men.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Well, that&rsquo;s even more, the reason that&rsquo;s appealing. You know, you&rsquo;re just an innocent girl, and you&rsquo;re beautiful. Now look at this quote - I wanted to say you&rsquo;re innocent. If you can read this. Come in tight on this quote. It says something to the effect, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use handcuffs on the show, but I probably have some in my house.&rdquo; What is that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> That was a question, you know, a specific question that was asked.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Oh, they always trick and they &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, about household items. You know, which I think, you know, if people really went through a list of household items, of things they have in their house, I think most people, if they were being honest, would say that maybe they have a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Do you have a pair of handcuffs in your house?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I probably, quite possibly do.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s the same answer. I don&rsquo;t. I do not. And I know I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no probably.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Well, maybe you just don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re there. Because &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Did you purchase handcuffs in your past?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh, maybe I was detained or maybe it was a birthday present.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> No wonder you got so scared when Buddy Hackett said he was a cop. That&rsquo;s the reason right there! You&rsquo;ve been arrested before.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It was, you know, for me it was like I was in Boogie Nights. And it was fantastic. It was like the one day of my life you know, and I felt like that. You know, I got into the Hollywood house and it was kind of very 70&rsquo;s, a beautiful house, and I could hear the music, like the Boogie Nights music and I had a great time.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Okay. Wow. I&rsquo;m gonna move off that just for a second.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Actually no, I&rsquo;m gonna move off it and not come back. [Jorja laughs] You were over in Europe recently, and was this for CSI promotion? I didn&rsquo;t know CSI was on over there, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, it is, actually, which is interesting. It&rsquo;s playing in a lot of countries. I think, the last I heard we&rsquo;re playing in 41 countries -</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &#8212; other than United States.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> How was uh, where&rsquo;d you go in Europe?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Oh, we started in New York for the show, and then Gary and Eric and I -</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Gary Dourdan.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Gary Dourdan, Eric Szmanda, found ourselves in Paris together and then I went on to the south of France. Just got back.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> We have pictures of you now, and you slept a lot while you were in Europe?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> You know, Craig, I was very tired.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> So this is you. This is you in London &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s London.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> &#8212; sleeping. Beginning of the trip. No handcuffs in sight, thank goodness.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> There were no handcuffs!</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> No handcuffs. And this is you, um, this time you have company in bed. I don&rsquo;t know if we can &hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s Paris actually.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s Paris, and that&rsquo;s the dog, also called Paris. And then this is you in Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s a different hotel in Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> That&rsquo;s a man. That&rsquo;s Gary.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It is Gary, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> You don&rsquo;t even know who that is?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> No, yeah, it&rsquo;s Gary.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> And you guys are getting along swimmingly, obviously.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> We haven&rsquo;t talked. We haven&rsquo;t talked since Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> We don&rsquo;t have much time left but are you still a vegetarian? How&rsquo;s that going?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> You don&rsquo;t miss -</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It was interesting in Europe. But it was good.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Yeah! How&rsquo;d you enjoy the food over there?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I ate a lot of pasta, and pastries, a lot of coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Boy, that&rsquo;s healthy!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good diet.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> There ya go. I&rsquo;m a vegetarian. I&rsquo;m having pastries and coffee. Alright, well, I think it&rsquo;s very exciting. CSI, number 1 show. Nice to see you again. That&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn</strong> Jorja Fox. We&rsquo;ll be right back.<br />

		<p><em>Within six years, Jorja Fox has graced three top 10 shows - ER, The West Wing, and now CSI. She&rsquo;s the kind of Hollywood Success Story that seems, well, almost suspect.</em></p>

<p>They call her the lucky charm. First, Jorja Fox was gun-toting intern Dr. Maggie Doyle on <em>ER</em>. Then she was Secret Service Agent Gina Toscano, who protected the president&rsquo;s daughter on <em>The West Wing</em>. When both of those story lines ended, Fox went on to play forensic-science hotshot Sara Sidle on CBS&rsquo;s smash hit <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> (Thursdays, 9 P.M./ET). The actress with the angelic face and raspy voice has hopscotched to yet another hit series. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like out talisman,&rdquo; says costar Gary Dourdan, who plays criminalist Warrick Brown, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s been on all these great dramas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fun for <em>CSI</em> viewers is following the crew as they unravel the mysteries behind assorted revolting crime scenes: lacerated bodies in shopping carts, corpses whose mouths are stuffed with apples. For Fox, 33, dealing with the nitty-gritty role can take its toll. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t even the blood and guts [that really get to me],&rdquo; she says over a brunch of a chocolate croissant and cappuccino. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the violence. There&rsquo;s such an emptiness of soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Am intriguing combination of a big-city and small-town girl, Fox was born the younger of two children (her brother is 12 years older) in New York City and raised from age 3 in Melbourne Beach, Florida. Her bother is a 78-year-old retired paper-products salesman; her mother, an Air Canada reservations agent, died of ovarian cancer at age 69 in 1996. &ldquo;My mom was a child of the Depression,&rdquo; Fox says. &ldquo;The thing that gave her the most joy was feeding us. We were eating six meals a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At 14, a crush on an older boy helped Fox tackle what had become a serious weight problem (152 pounds at age 12). At 15, the newly slim, self-described &ldquo;messy tomboy&rdquo; shocked everyone by willing a shopping-mall modeling contest. Fox subsequently returned to New York, where she lived in a residence for models while working and completing high school. She used her earnings over the next three years to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, among other schools. &ldquo;My mother had wanted to be a painter and my father a writer. They didn&rsquo;t do any of those things,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but they really supported me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is especially poignant that in 1996 her mother was diagnosed with cancer when Fox landed her &ldquo;dream role&rdquo; on <em>ER</em>. That was the last thing Marilyn Fox ever saw Jorja do. &ldquo;I was having the biggest personal crisis and the greatest professional thing happening at the same time,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>The loss affected her deeply &#8212; and <em>CSI</em> reminds her of it often. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always surprising how close [death] is,&rdquo; she says. And Fox worries that her 12-14 hour days are hurting her relationships with the people who are still here. &ldquo;Sometimes, I feel like I&rsquo;m a terrible daughter, a terrible friend,&rdquo; Fox says quietly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lucky, people stick around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That kind of insecurity may explain why Fox, who&rsquo;s dating a film actor (whom she won&rsquo;t name), has yet to marry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some really great affairs, but I&rsquo;m allergic to marriage,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>This summer, Fox is visiting her dad in Florida before she takes a European vacation. And she hopes her lock will still hold. She calls <em>CSI</em> &ldquo;the best job ever.&rdquo; Could she do it in real life? No way, says costar William Petersen, who remembers a white-knuckled Fox clutching his arm during a helicopter ride over the Nevada desert during one episode. &ldquo;She has a very delicate stomach,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t even like looking at crime photos.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>[CSI] has an outstanding cast with William Petersen, Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Actress Jorja Fox, also known for her roles in <em>ER</em> and <em>West Wing</em>, who conducts her murder investigations detatched and focused on tv: &ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m an absolute pascifist. The show gives me nightmares. When the shootings are over [for the season]. I&rsquo;m relieved that I can escape for a couple of months. It&rsquo;s all just so realistic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>Her collegue Eric Szmanda: &ldquo;In the show, I&rsquo;m completely obsessed with DNA and cloning. Jorja and I have a kind of romantic relationship. Maybe, in the future, we&rsquo;ll at least have a one-night stand.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Who better than Eric Szmanda of the #1 television drama C.S.I. to investigate his beautiful co-star Jorja Fox? Eric says that when filming wraps for the summer he plans on &ldquo;travelling to Europe and hitting the film festivals&rdquo;. May we suggest a less violent approach, say a handshake, when arriving in Berlin?</p>

<p><em>Jorja Fox, actor interviewed by Eric Szmanda</em></p>

<p><strong>Eric Szmanda:</strong> Has working on CSI changed your outlook on life?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, last night when I cooked dinner for myself in my toaster-oven, I sat down and watched NOVA. [laughter] I sat right down and picked that station. They were having this great show on black holes and stars in the galaxy, and I don&rsquo;t know why, of all the channels, I thought maybe I&rsquo;ll watch NOVA tonight.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> You feel this obligation to study up.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I was always into true crime. It was always about the psychological aspects, the thin line that people walk, you know. What makes somebody go one way and somebody go another? And how two people can have the same sort of family situation and one becomes a violent mind and the other becomes a great writer. Forensic psychology is an area of the show that I wish we had more of because it fascinates me so much. I miss it and we started to do it for a minute and they pulled back on it and decided it was another show. I&rsquo;m also interested in the Sci-Fi and horror genres. So it translated really well.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Nice combination.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I know, even though I had sort of pulled back. I was scared of everything because I was always engulfing myself in scary things. So I needed to cut myself off a little bit and now it&rsquo;s good balances it out a bit better.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How was it working on MEMENTO with Guy Pearce?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Working on MEMENTO was a dream literally. I had no idea what was going on and was too embarrassed to say anything. I found out later nobody knew what was going on. Chris Nolan had three separate story ideas going on in the editing process. It was really fun and a complete surprise from shooting it to even right now. And Guy Pearce was one of my favorite movie husbands. He&rsquo;s totally grounded and sweet. Very wise.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What was that thing in your life that steered you in this direction?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Steered me in the acting direction?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I always wanted to be an actress. Maybe because I grew up in an immigrant family - I have a 99-year-old grandmother - and this idea if the old world and the storytelling. I loved for my mom and my grandmother to sit down at night and tell these stories and they were really good at it. So from a really young age I just loved the idea of storytelling. I had a little TV problem, too. From age 5 to 15.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What were your favorite shows?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, there several over the ages. CHARLIE&rsquo;S ANGEL was a big one. LOST IN SPACE I loved, and THE BIONIC WOMAN.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> All those are just a little bit before my time. Those were all in syndication by the time I was-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Well, yeah, LOST IN SPACE is old. They were in syndication when I watched them too. MASH, was one of my favorite shows ever. I think I&rsquo;ve seen every MASH ever made.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> It&rsquo;s the MASH anniversary right now.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Is it really?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yeah, I saw Hot Lips on THE TODAY SHOW this morning.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Nice. The show was going on during the Vietnam War, but they called it Korea because they couldn&rsquo;t be that controversial.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> If you weren&rsquo;t doing this what would it be?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Music, which no one ever paid me a cent to do.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Singing?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Guitar probably. Or maybe I&rsquo;d go into politics. Yeah, I have a romance about it. Which is probably all because I&rsquo;ve never done anything in politics. It seems so romantic and cool to me. Everyday doing things that you think you believe in, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s better in thought. What do you think you&rsquo;d be doing?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I&rsquo;d probably still be working in the music business. It&rsquo;s the only other thing I can see myself doing. I think it would have to be some kind of promotion or entertainment of some kind.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It seems to me, I don&rsquo;t know much about the music industry, but it seems that it&rsquo;s always at the insanity level, except for maybe the Motown years. Everything got made right for awhile but it seems like the pendulum has gone to the other side again. A band can have number one singles and still not have any money at all.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> The average member in a rock band makes about the same salary as a 7-11 employee.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Whoa!</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Until your album starts selling millions you don&rsquo;t seeing anything in terms of residuals. So a lot of them just blow their wad way too early and then they are left with nothing, which I have seen happen to a lot of my friends.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> You imagine it&rsquo;s the beginning of your new life, you know. You get this great deal and the money comes in. You get better equipment and a nice van, and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> It still comes out of your budget, which a lot of bands don&rsquo;t realize either. Dirty business, I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re involved in such a dirty business. [laughter]</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Is there a business that&rsquo;s not dirty though?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I doubt it. I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s all pretty relative. My dad sells medical supplies and there&rsquo;s really no difference in the everyday interaction with clients versus what I was doing when I was trying to sell records. It&rsquo;s all the same, it&rsquo;s just products. Even what we&rsquo;re doing, we are just selling a product.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Absolutely, a very popular product. A product that a lot of people are interested in and they&rsquo;ll spend money on. It&rsquo;s going to be real interesting to see Time/Warner this year with the new CEO. If I ever had a company, I would try to keep as much integrity as I possibly could, and I think they&rsquo;ve done that with so much genius. Or at least compared to a lot of other companies out there. They&rsquo;ve done some pioneering, beautiful things.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> When you got into this acting thing, did you ever think some day you&rsquo;d be seen as a product?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah, I think what&rsquo;s so funny about it is that you&rsquo;re lucky if you&rsquo;re seen as a product. That&rsquo;s a lucky thing. Probably from the time I was 16 there started to be an awareness of that, but this really is a business. There is art and there&rsquo;s business and sometimes they get together. Art needs business and business definitely needs art.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How do you deal with it?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I haven&rsquo;t been called on to be a product really. I think I&rsquo;ve been really lucky, It&rsquo;s weird because I was coming from New York City and I had some ideas about LA that weren&rsquo;t very nice. I thought it was a place people came to sell out. That greed is at the base of everything that happens in LA. It was naive of me. Im glad I&rsquo;ve stayed and stuck it out for a while because in LA I&rsquo;ve met more people with more heart and soul than maybe I ever got to meet in New York. How long have you lived here?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Seven years.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Longer than me even.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Yes, I spent a year of that in Chicago and six months in Vancouver.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> What year were you in Chicago?</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> &lsquo;96-&lsquo;97</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I think I was already in LA. I spent a year in Chicago in 1995.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Doing what?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I did a TV series in Chicago.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> What was it?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> It was called MISSING PERSONS. We looked for missing people. [laughter] Which is sometimes what we do here on CSI. We didn&rsquo;t have the gadgets at all. Mostly we just talked to people, we did interviews and things like that. We did look for clues sometimes, but it wasn&rsquo;t really the kind of clues we look for now.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> How did you like Chicago?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I love Chicago in the summertime, but it was really hard for me to work there in the winter. You are in high heels and it&rsquo;s 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and it&rsquo;s negative 60 degrees. That kind of grueling cold. The camera was frozen and they&rsquo;d have to thaw out the camera. I think it&rsquo;s an amazing city.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> Do you think you&rsquo;ll stay here in LA.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever stay anywhere forever. If I want to keep acting there&rsquo;s only really one place that I would want to go. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit acting so I came here. And it&rsquo;s been really good to me. It&rsquo;s been really good to you too.</p>

<p><strong>ES:</strong> I&rsquo;d say. No reason to complain. [laughter]</p>
