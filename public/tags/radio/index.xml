      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m Danni and I&amp;rsquo;ll be your host today. We have another very exciting show this afternoon. We&amp;rsquo;ll be talking to Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; is, you must have been living under a rock. So. While we are waiting for her to call in, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a music break. So enjoy it. This is going to be Kimberly Cole, &amp;ldquo;Arrow through my Heart&amp;rdquo;. (music plays). [&amp;lsquo;¦] I&amp;rsquo;m very excited! We do actually have Jorja, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to go ahead and bring her on. Hi, Jorja, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, Danni. How&amp;rsquo;s it going? I&amp;rsquo;m good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m great. We&amp;rsquo;re very excited! We don&amp;rsquo;t have a whole lot of time so I want to jump right into it. Because obviously &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; is premiering Season 12 starts. What can we expect? What are some of the biggest changes we&amp;rsquo;re going to see this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, we&amp;rsquo;re counting down, you know we&amp;rsquo;re always hopeful about a new season. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the best times of the year actually, is to get to work and not be on the air because you can just kind of go away and concentrate on your stuff and not worry too much about, you know, the ratings and all the other stuff that comes with premieres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But obviously we have a new, two new actors that have joined us this year, the first one being Ted Danson, who I swear I&amp;rsquo;ve seen feathers coming out of the back of his jacket. I think he&amp;rsquo;s an angel. I will confirm that later in the year. He&amp;rsquo;s just the warmest, coolest cat and so funny. So you know, that&amp;rsquo;s on. &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; might just be a bit funnier this year. We&amp;rsquo;ve done some dark humor stuff. We love to put comedy in the show where we can. There&amp;rsquo;s just something about having Danson with us that I&amp;rsquo;ve got bets that we might be a funnier show this year. He&amp;rsquo;s going to join the cast tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another surprise is we have Elizabeth who plays Morgan, who kind of guest starred on the show near the end of last season. She was a lab tech when some of the cast when to Los Angeles when we were chasing this horrible serial killer. She was in the lab and she&amp;rsquo;s going to join us this season. She&amp;rsquo;s Marc- Ecklie&amp;rsquo;s daughter, who is often the evil villain top of the police chain, that gives a lot of the characters a hard time. So she&amp;rsquo;ll be with us. I think she&amp;rsquo;s, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember if she&amp;rsquo;s in this episode tonight, I think she joins us next week. She&amp;rsquo;s fantastic and edgy and young. So we&amp;rsquo;re looking to have a really good year. We&amp;rsquo;re really optimistic and hope the fans stick with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I am very excited. I&amp;rsquo;m sure fans are too. Obviously, you have to be a fan favorite. Was it a shock for you when you left in 2007 and you saw all the fans campaigning to get you back? What was that like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh. It was probably the nicest thing that&amp;rsquo;s ever happened to me. And uh, really overwhelming and a surprise. You know I kind of left because I was exhausted. And I think somewhere along the way because I&amp;rsquo;d had some skirmishes in the past with the show, I think some of the fans thought I was being sort of angled off the show. And I just needed to lie down for a while and take a break. And so it was, it was really, you know, to this day it still kind of still surprises me when I think about it. I got some rest and then I came back. And then Billy got tired and so he left. And we&amp;rsquo;re hearing murmurs that Marg is tired. The year will &amp;lsquo;¦ You know, &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; I think we do some of our best work when we have unexpected changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re always devastating. Nobody knew that Lawrence wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be coming back. And that was heartbreaking for me. He&amp;rsquo;s a great guy and I really loved working with him and then sort of in the middle of the summer, we got this email during the middle of the night that perhaps he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be joining us. You know, I guess in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing when there are changes to a show that&amp;rsquo;s been on for 12 years. In other ways, it&amp;rsquo;s really sad and hard to adjust to. And even though we&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily what people would think of as a character-driven show, you know, the fans get attached to characters and we certainly, tended to fall in love with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s one thing that &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; has been really good at is they&amp;rsquo;ve always seemed to bring people into the cast that really get along and have a lot of chemistry. So it is hard to say goodbye when people want to, but I understand because I was the first one that got tired and needed to lie down. I understand other characters do to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Well you did come back so obviously you love playing Sara. What is one of your favorite things about being on the show and playing her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; I think one of my favorite things, and this is probably weird considering it is &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, but, I got to do this sort of long, slow kind of mysterious love story in the midst of the show with William Petersen. You know, it was sort of over five or six seasons. I was always struck by through all the darkness and all the heaviness and all the despair, that somewhere in there could be this idea of love and intimacy and sort of a stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it&amp;rsquo;s also been one of the hardest to play now that he&amp;rsquo;s gone. You know, I think that Sara&amp;rsquo;s kind of, she&amp;rsquo;s lonely&amp;rsquo;¦and I think she&amp;rsquo;s getting slightly more frigid by the episode since he&amp;rsquo;s not around. (laugh). It&amp;rsquo;s hard to have a long-distance love affair. I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all had at least one in our lives. So I miss him but playing that love story and the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re still married and that they&amp;rsquo;re still in love is kind of one of the most fun things for me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Now obviously aside from that, that&amp;rsquo;s got to be an emotional you know, having that long distance relationship, but Sara&amp;rsquo;s gone through some really emotional storylines, being kidnapped, everything like that [Jorja says Ugh!]. Any particular episode that sticks out as being particularly nerve-racking for you to shoot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the hardest, most recent episodes is actually this episode we did about hoarders and which George Eads and Eric Szmanda had a real big storyline in. It had been George&amp;rsquo;s dream, he&amp;rsquo;d started watching some of the documentary shows that are on about hoarding and became quite obsessive compulsion about that in his own way and had made some suggestions to the writers that we need to do one of these&amp;rsquo;¦we should tell this story, this would be great. And so about a year and a half coming, and when the episode came out, we were thrilled for George and I was thrilled that I got to be a part of it, but you know, even though we built a set that was actually a hoarder&amp;rsquo;s house, it was incredibly claustrophobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though all the garbage was set garbage, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t real garbage, by the time we got out of there, we spent about four days on that set, and something inevitably did start to smell quite bad. It took three days to figure out I think it was a bag of frozen noodles that was supposed to in the fridge that somebody forgot to unpack. It ended up like under eight feet of sheets, and televisions and video tapes, and so even by day three there was a smell on stage that nobody could quite put their finger on and we were worried that it was like a mouse or something that had met with a horrible demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got off that stage when we were done, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize, I knew I was a little claustrophobic and I know that I&amp;rsquo;m not a stuff person, I&amp;rsquo;m more a minimalist person, and it confirmed everything that I thought about myself when we were finally done. It was hard to shoot but we were really happy with the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it was intense, and put a whole camera crew in there, you know, it was just like little, we called them goat trails, these tiny little pathways throughout the set, where everybody would try and hang lights and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; It has to be amazing to be a part of something like this. In early 2011, &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; was the most watched show in the entire world. So what is it like knowing you&amp;rsquo;re a part of such a phenomenon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; That, first of all, is an amazing compliment. And it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a serial, because the ratings have slipped a bit in the States, but we still have our game on, you know we&amp;rsquo;re still hoping that this year we&amp;rsquo;re going to surprise everybody one more time. First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s such an honor to be the number one show once, even just one week, forget a couple weeks in a row, and here worldwide. I got to travel to Europe this summer, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done in a few years. And that was an amazing experience. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really hit home, sometimes, until you go out into the world and you start talking to people and meeting people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in some pretty remote places, the southern tip of Europe, but everybody&amp;rsquo;s got a satellite dish! I kind of thought, &amp;lsquo;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have a kind of low key vacation! It&amp;rsquo;ll be quiet and I won&amp;rsquo;t think about &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; for a few weeks.&amp;lsquo; and I was very pleased to find out everybody was watching the show, and knew who I was. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing, and it is, like, to have &amp;#8212; We&amp;rsquo;ve been very lucky to have a pretty diverse crowd that&amp;rsquo;s followed the show. Not only is it age-wise and ethnicity and different regions of America, like wether it&amp;rsquo;s city people or country people, but to think about that it goes out beyond the States is a really, really, really amazing feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Very awesome. Now, aside from &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, anything you&amp;rsquo;re working on right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh gosh, I&amp;rsquo;m always shuttling around my little projects that I love. I have a feature documentary that we&amp;rsquo;ve just finished. That&amp;rsquo;s really the story of 14-year old girl that goes to Thailand to learn about elephants. The movie&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&amp;lsquo; We have a website, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://howibecameanelephant.com&#34;&gt;http://howibecameanelephant.com&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;ve submitted to festivals. It&amp;rsquo;s a really exciting documentary. There are some hard things to watch, obviously. Elephants sometimes get a raw deal in our post-modern world, where space is at a premium. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful story. We&amp;rsquo;re hoping &amp;#8212; We&amp;rsquo;re going to do the festivals for a few months. We&amp;rsquo;re talking to distributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to tell you more about that in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Very awesome. Those are pretty much all the questions that I have for you, because this is such a short time. But if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind, we like to get a tag from all of our guests. So if you would just say &amp;lsquo;This is Jorja Fox. You&amp;rsquo;re listening to Artists on Demand.&amp;lsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay great! And I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I would have been listening to your station this morning, but I was scared to hear my voice in stereo while we spoke! [everyone laughs] Hey! This is Jorja Fox, and you&amp;rsquo;re listening to Artists on Demand Radio!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Awesome. Well thank you so much for coming on and talking to us. Definitely we&amp;rsquo;d love to have you back again. In the meantime-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you! I love you guys, you guys do great stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ARTIST ON DEMAND:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, thank you! Well it was such a pleasure and have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright! You too, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s 9:15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; And what a treat for us. &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; returns tonight at 9 on CBS. Ladies and gentlemen, Jorja Fox right now on the Kevin and Bean show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Aw, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; More importantly, Sara Sidle returns tonight. That&amp;rsquo;s what I care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Yes yes yes.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; What your character has been put through in the course of this series, Jorja-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; My goodness gracious! Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; is been ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I would have to agree. But happily so. It&amp;rsquo;s been so much fun to do all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Great stuff to play, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; There was one episode alone where I felt like the writers were trying to kill me. Just about every way that you could try to kill somebody on this show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; They crushed you with a car, I remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! There was under the car, there was getting thrown out of the car, there was a fistfight, there was walking through the desert. You know, pretty much, yeah! The whole episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; And then they sent you off to Costa Rica. And now you&amp;rsquo;re back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;ve last seen Sara. That was a big moment, cause there Billy and I were, under the sort of like, the Costa Rican canopy, and it was-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; By Billy you mean William Petersen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; William Petersen, of course, yes. He plays Grissom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m gonna start calling him Billy! I like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Only it may be a little overly familiar! But I thought &amp;ldquo;Well, this might be it!&amp;rdquo; You know, &amp;ldquo;This might be the end of Sara&amp;rsquo;s chapter, it might be the last time I&amp;rsquo;m here.&amp;rdquo; So I was very surprised to get a call this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; And that time, you came back cause Warrick got shot. Right? That was the circumstance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well that was, you know, that&amp;rsquo;s still something that&amp;rsquo;s sort of a touchy subject. I wish that Warrick was alive out there, somewhere. But. Warrick was murdered, before the last scene where Billy goes to Costa Rica. So the last time we see &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! that&amp;rsquo;s right that&amp;rsquo;s right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; William Petersen and Sara Sidle, is in a Costa Rican rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; My timeline was off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, you know, Jorja, time travel is very big on TV these days. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it possible that you guys could go back to just before he was shot and stop it? Save him? Put him back on the show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I- You know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pitching a prequel for years! It gets harder and harder. We&amp;rsquo;re starting our tenth season, so to try and do a prequel means people have to de-age us by a decade. And that&amp;rsquo;s pretty challenging at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Piece of cake! Piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe the animated prequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Before we get caught up and talk about what happens tonight, and the return of season 10, thereâs no way anyone, in the beginning, thought that &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; would turn into one of the biggest hits in the history of television. When you guys started, I mean, this was something new on network television. Your show came out, doing stuff different. But nobody expected the juggernaut that it became, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought a show about death, on a Friday night, was gonna be a gigantic clunker. Really, terrible, horrible, clunker. But the story was so intriguing to me, I sort of fell under a trance from the moment I read the script. I was like &amp;ldquo;Alright, well I have to do this!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I think, people take it for granted now, but at the time we had never seen anything like it before on television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you. Well, there was Quincy! That goes back a ways&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host 2:&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] This is far stretch from Quincy. Forensics have come a long way since Quincy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] Yes. And they&amp;rsquo;re still coming a long way which, I think, is an advantage that we have. New technology is coming out every month, and we can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; I remember in the early episodes, where they would follow the path of a bullet into the body, and show you all the damage it does. And your head would explode! You&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it, even in a movie, let alone on television! And then, you thought initially, week to week, solving cases, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen this done on tons of procedural cop shows, and that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the standard. The old standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; But the character development in &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; is what I feel really set it apart. How we got so attached to your characters and followed them through all these different permutations over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Like an old suit, from the 70s, slowly but surely-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; But you find twenty bucks pockets! Now you must have, in the course of research or just interaction with experts that come by to advice on the show, you must have dealt with a lot of real life C.S.I. people over the years. Who are the people that go into this field, that love this kind of work? What drives them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a very diverse group. I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a couple things they have to have. They have to have almost like an OCD type of focus, and a patience and a persistence. And I think they&amp;rsquo;ve got to be very, very, committed to crime fighting. And we still, every day, we have a tech advisor on our set, every day, still trying to help us look as realistic as possible. There&amp;rsquo;s real crime scene investigators in the writers room almost every day. We have personal relationships with a lot of those guys, both from &amp;ndash; The cool thing about our show because we shoot in LA but we take place in Vegas is that we can &amp;ndash; if it&amp;rsquo;s real in either one of those cities, we can put it on air. So we have people from both cities giving us stories and advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh I see! Are there are lot of women that go into the field? And are there &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; women going into the field now because of you? And because of Catherine&amp;rsquo;s character?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Well that&amp;rsquo;s very kind of you. They tell us that that&amp;rsquo;s true. That yes, there are a lot of women going into the field. One of our first advisors, Liz Devine, was in Los Angeles, a very early sort of woman in the field, and she was blonde and well endowed in all the right places. Sort of faced that textbook stuff you hear about when women enter fields that they&amp;rsquo;re not traditionally in. More and more so, I think women, if I&amp;rsquo;m going to get stereotypical, I think women are really, really geared towards the field because of that patience and that persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; But they&amp;rsquo;re not really smart enough though, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;rsquo;re very good at detail oriented work, where you&amp;rsquo;re on hour eleven and you&amp;rsquo;re still holding your focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Really it&amp;rsquo;s just puzzle solving more than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, great big puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me ask you one more question before the break. Jorja Fox is here and will tell you all about the premiere of season ten of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. But here&amp;rsquo;s the question I have to ask, is it true that because of the success of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, it is harder now to impress a jury? Or harder to &amp;ndash; in many cases a jury will think that they real life is like the television show, and it makes it harder for prosecutors sometimes, when they don&amp;rsquo;t have the slam dunk, scientific evidence that you often come up with on your show. Have you heard that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; What we hear, actually, is the opposite. We hear it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder for cops. For instance, I get my car broken into, and a police officer arrives, and I want the crime solved in, like, 48-hours, and I want him to pull out his DNA kit, fingerprinting and stuff. I think, originally, in courtrooms, it made it a little easier, because these guys were pitching this kind of science, for a while, but juries weren&amp;rsquo;t quite grasping it. Now they have a really good understanding of what all of it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Ballistics, GSR, latent GSR! GSR all over his hands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Laypeople &amp;ndash; We amateurs know so much more about police work and science of the C.S.I. than we ever would have thought possible, because you found a way to make it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; returns tonight at 9. A quick break! More with Jorja Fox, if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us all the Swine Flu, when we return, right after this on the Kevin and Bean Show!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Jorja Fox is in our studio. The return of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, season 10, tonight at 9 on CBS. Now because you&amp;rsquo;re the big dog on the television schedule, every year the other networks try to figure out &amp;ldquo;How are we going to take &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; down.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What are we going to do this year to take &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; down?&amp;rdquo; You have been up against every show in the history of television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; True! Yeah, and we&amp;rsquo;re up against a pretty good one right now, who&amp;rsquo;s name I can&amp;rsquo;t mention on the air. But you guys have been promoting it several times this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa (co-host):&lt;/strong&gt; Oops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re not responsible for commercials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, little medical drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t hold it against us! &amp;ndash; OH! That one! Oh that show SUCKS! It&amp;rsquo;s all &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;! It&amp;rsquo;s way &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Aww! Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re either gay or Lisa if you&amp;rsquo;re gonna watch that show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s just a chick show, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; So Sara returns tonight. Do we find out the state of her relationship with Grissom, while they&amp;rsquo;ve been away? Do we look into that at all this evening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; In about 12 short hours, in Los Angeles, you will. I think you&amp;rsquo;ll get at least a sort of an establishing amount of information that I was very pleased with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve all been curious what&amp;rsquo;s been going on after that kiss in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I think we were in Costa Rica for a nice long time. That&amp;rsquo;s all I can say at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa:&lt;/strong&gt; Got a lot accomplished, did you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; How used to seeing Sara can we get, as fans of the show? You gonna be around for a while, or is this another hit and run? You gonna tease us and run off again? Another foreign country you gonna run off to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I know, right? I keep having these really big, dramatic, goodbyes, and then &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s like &amp;ldquo;Oh, gosh! It&amp;rsquo;s her again!&amp;rdquo; I think you can&amp;rsquo;t pull that off that much before &amp;ndash; I mean people are already rolling their eyes at me. They&amp;rsquo;ve done that for years. That will continue, I think, if I keep saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m back! Goodbye!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;But this time I mean it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Send me flowers!&amp;rdquo; No, I&amp;rsquo;m visiting, and I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to do so. As I said, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting it at all, especially after the Costa Rican episode. SO we&amp;rsquo;ll see! We&amp;rsquo;re taking it one day at a time. It&amp;rsquo;s so much fun, it&amp;rsquo;s like going home in some respects. In some respects it&amp;rsquo;s like having a brand new job and being somewhere for the first time. I have so much love and devotion in my heart for everybody there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; How&amp;rsquo;s Laurence Flishburn- Fishburne to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Laurence Flishburn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Everyone laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Laurence Flishburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Notable actor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve started drinking already. Laurence Fishburne, one of my favorite actors, and he&amp;rsquo;s so good on the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; He is! He&amp;rsquo;s spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; How exciting is it to work with that stature when you come back to a project like &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Very humbly. You know, Liev Schrieber guest stared a couple seasons ago too, and he and Fishburne would be two of my all time favorite actors. It&amp;rsquo;s just kind of weird that all of the sudden they&amp;rsquo;re sort of like at your house. You know? Like they knock on the door and you&amp;rsquo;re like &amp;lsquo;Hey, come on in! Would you like a cup of coffee?&amp;rsquo; or something. He&amp;rsquo;s amazing. He&amp;rsquo;s as kind and benevolent and generous and sweet and funny as you could ever imagine that he might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s where you&amp;rsquo;ve got smart guys and gals running the show. Because when you lose your star, when you lose Mr. Grissom&amp;rsquo;s character, when you lose that you need a guy with &amp;ndash; not only a great actor, but with gravitas. Who can come in and pick up the slack. And he has that. He&amp;rsquo;s one of those guys, you can&amp;rsquo;t take your eyes off the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Mesmerizing. And he&amp;rsquo;s sicker than I am and he&amp;rsquo;s in New York doing the press, so you&amp;rsquo;ve gotta give him credit for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; He&amp;rsquo;s spreading the virus on that coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; We all have the &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; bug, it&amp;rsquo;s very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; What did you do, when you left the show, about the show? Did you continue to watch it as a fan, or did you not want to see your boyfriend move on with another woman?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah! That was scary! And that happened a little bit. Sort of. They left that very ambiguous, thank God. I watched for a while and then I realized, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on sabbatical. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a year off.&amp;rdquo; And then I kind of turned off my TV. So for the most part there was very little that I watched, including &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, in that year. I did a bunch of traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! That&amp;rsquo;s a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought, if I&amp;rsquo;m really gonna take a year off, as long as my heads in the game, if I&amp;rsquo;m watching TV every night. But, when they called this summer, I had them TIVO&amp;rsquo;d, most of them, and I did sit down at watch a lot of them. I still have a couple left to watch. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked my way up to the season finale of last year, it&amp;rsquo;s the one episode I haven&amp;rsquo;t see yet. Which is weird, because we&amp;rsquo;re premiering tonight, so I&amp;rsquo;ve probably have to go home and watch it today! I have to watch it this afternoon! And I thought last season was amazing, I thought they did a really great job. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to lose three characters in the space of a year or so. The writers are brilliant. I thought they handled very well, and I thought that &amp;ndash; there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a ton of subtext on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; the last year. Everybody&amp;rsquo;s been grieving the loss of old people, and also hopeful of new folks coming in. I think that played on screen a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; And plus, you just want to see McDreamy happy. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa:&lt;/strong&gt; Not the same show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, who are you? What radio show is this? Where am I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa:&lt;/strong&gt; Big boy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s a tweet question for you, Jorja. Eric wants to know if it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard to act with all the special effects that they use on the show?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Eric. To be honest with you, I rarely see the special effects. We&amp;rsquo;re generally in a stage, we&amp;rsquo;re in a room. We see more &amp;ndash; we see the stunts and the car wrecks and things like that. But a lot of the &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; stuff that they do comes in post-production, which is one of the reasons I actually really watch the show! Because so much of it happens in post. The music gets laid in post. We&amp;rsquo;re really proud of our music, we&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of really amazing bands come through. And I like to watch everybody else&amp;rsquo;s work and see what they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Tonight at nine on CBS. For folks who are gonna try &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, or haven&amp;rsquo;t been paying as close attention as they should, what is the 30-second setup that you give people that are prepared to sit down and watch &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Ten years of work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s not saying recap every plot point!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; I gotta pitch it? I can say this. When I read the script this summer, I think, whenever you&amp;rsquo;ve been on as long as we have &amp;ndash; and we&amp;rsquo;re ooooolllld now, I feel like we&amp;rsquo;ve got canes and walkers and all kinds of stuff &amp;hellip; Geritol. I read the script, I was excited I was coming back, and I was like, &amp;ldquo;You know, this show&amp;rsquo;s probably peaked. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a great script.&amp;rdquo; I thought it&amp;rsquo;s probably &amp;hellip; The best is in the past. And when I read the first page of the first scene, I was strapped into a seatbelt and I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Game. On.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow! That sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; And I hope that Sara and Catherine will finally act on their long standing attraction to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s been coming up a lot, actually!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&amp;rsquo;s about time for that wrinkle to be &amp;hellip; on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone should get something on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, sweeps have got to be right around the corner. Let&amp;rsquo;s not be crazy here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, Jorja, so nice to finally meet you. We&amp;rsquo;ll happily take the Swine Flu from you-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; -just because you happen to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much for having me, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan. You guys have been so nice to me for such a long time, and it&amp;rsquo;s really an honor to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you, Jorja. &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; tonight at 9 on CBS!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Barnes:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Michael Barnes and I&amp;rsquo;m here with actress, Jorja Fox. Jorja has become a familiar face by playing major roles in three of the most successful television dramas in history: &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and, most recently, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be playing excerpts of songs she selected that have inspired her over the years, as part of KCRW&amp;rsquo;s Guest DJ Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi Michael. First of all, thank you so much for having me. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan, I&amp;rsquo;m a little nervous. So what I finally did [for my song selections] is stick a little bit to a piano/keyboard theme. I kind of had to try and find something to sort of narrow it down. The first song I picked is &amp;ldquo;Jet&amp;rdquo;, which was written by Paul McCartney and done by Paul McCartney and Wings. I was at the Coachella Music Festival &amp;ndash; Coachella &amp;lsquo;09 &amp;ndash; Paul McCartney headlined on Friday night, and I knew by the second verse of this first song that it was going to be one of the best concerts I had ever been to in my entire life. And he opened with &amp;ldquo;Jet&amp;rdquo;, so I figured I would open with &amp;ldquo;Jet&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, obviously, I could talk about The Beatles probably for about two weeks straight and not even come up for air. It was very hard to pick one song. I grew up with The Beatles. My brother was 12 years older than me, and when he went to college my mom got him an eight track, so he left me all of his albums and his 45âs, and I scored this giant Beatles collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; You just heard a sample from Paul McCartney and Wings. The song is &amp;ldquo;Jet&amp;rdquo;, picked by Jorja Fox, who is our guest here for KCRW&amp;rsquo;s Guest DJ Project. What do you have next for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a song called &amp;ldquo;The Story&amp;rdquo;, by the Matthew Herbert Big Band. Matthew Herbert has done a whole bunch of different genres of albums. I think this is his second compilation of big band music. I&amp;rsquo;m a subscriber to KCRW, a proud subscriber, and I got the winter CD you guys give out to all of us that give to the station, and on it was this song. The first time I heard it, I was in rapture, like from the first couple of notes of this song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; My father &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m gonna take you through a tour of my family I think at this point &amp;ndash; my father is 85 years old, he lives in sunny Florida, he served in World War II, he&amp;rsquo;s a huge, huge, huge music lover. My mother never cared for music at all, as a matter of fact, she would often argue with him to turn it off. So my love of music comes from my dad and my brother. My dad grew up with big bands and jazz, so from a very, very early age, I was exposed to that [genre] &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s kind of the only records he had. He still puts Brylcreem in his hair. And I feel really honored cuz growing up sort of in the seventies in a beach town in Florida, I would have never been exposed to big band and jazz if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been for my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; You just heard an excerpt from Matthew Herbert Big Band. The name of the song is &amp;ldquo;The Story&amp;rdquo; from the most recent record, &lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s Me and There&amp;rsquo;s You&lt;/em&gt;. And that was something that was picked by actress, Jorja Fox, who you may know from &lt;em&gt;ER&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt; and, most recently, from &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; as Dr. Sara Sidle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, Doctor, I love that &amp;ndash; scientist, technically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientist, okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; But yeah, kind of doctor, and a lot of people think cop. But I guess technically we were always scientists. We worked for the cops, but we weren&amp;rsquo;t technically cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; There you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Obscure fact, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; So what do you have next for us, Jorja?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, this is where I start to get a little crafty. Again, because it was so hard to pick five songs, I started to find songs that I loved that were covered by artists that I love, in an effort to talk about more songs and more artists. My favorite band right now is a band called Hot Chip. I love them &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re so danceable, they&amp;rsquo;re listenable, they&amp;rsquo;re fun. I love their lyrics. [This is] one of the newer songs they have out that I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with, I think was released in February of &amp;lsquo;09. [It] is a cover of Joy Division&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Transmission&amp;rdquo;, which is on a great compilation album called &lt;em&gt;War Child: Heroes, Volume 1&lt;/em&gt;. And what I had heard about it, which I think is so interesting, is the bands that were covered, actually picked the artist to cover their songs. So it&amp;rsquo;s my understanding that the New Order guys picked Hot Chip to do a Joy Division cover. I love Joy Division, I love New Order, I love Hot Chip &amp;ndash; here&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Transmission&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; I was lucky enough to grow up with this college radio station in Florida called WFIT. It&amp;rsquo;s a small, small, small, small town where I came from &amp;ndash; like one street with an ice cream parlor and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. And we had this radio station &amp;ndash; we sort of had a window to the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; Music from Hot Chip. &amp;ldquo;Transmission&amp;rdquo; is the name of the song, originally done by Joy Division and featured on &lt;em&gt;War Child: Heroes, Volume 1&lt;/em&gt; collection, picked by our guest here at KCRW, actress Jorja Fox. What do you have next for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Ugh, next. Again growing up in Florida it was really sort of heavy rock alternative music time. And when I finally got to New York, I finally made some friends who were kind of my own age and they were listening to Joni Mitchell who, I think, is one of the better song writers that ever was and guitarist and pianist. This particular track is &amp;ldquo;Black Crow&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s preformed and arranged by Diana Krall, who&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite contemporary jazz pianist artists right now. It&amp;rsquo;s a song about traveling. It&amp;rsquo;s a song about being on the road. But when I listen to it, I really feel like I&amp;rsquo;m flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Black Crow&amp;rdquo;, by Joni Mitchell covered by Diana Krall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; I love music. I actually took up the drums about a year and a half ago. I&amp;rsquo;m a very late beginner. In &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, as a mater of fact, we had a lunch time band for the longest time. There are so many people that play music on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. And lunch is only a half hour and people would run to the food truck, like just run, and get the food and throw it in the trailers and then go into the stage and we&amp;rsquo;d just leave our instruments there and we&amp;rsquo;d have jams for as long, you know, until they&amp;rsquo;d call us back to work and then you just eat your lunch cold throughout the day when you had time, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB:&lt;/strong&gt; You just heard a sample of Diana Krall doing Joni Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Black Crow&amp;rdquo;, you can find that on her album &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Other Room&lt;/em&gt; and that was selected by our guest here in the studios, actress Jorja Fox. So what do you have next for us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;So Danco Samba&amp;rdquo;, written of course by Getz and Gilberto. This particular version of it is my favorite. It&amp;rsquo;s performed by Ella Fitzgerald and I was in Costa Rica last spring, I surf and I&amp;rsquo;d been surfing all day in Costa Rica, and I get out of the water with my surfboard and I go down this tiny little hotel that had 20 tables set up in the sand on the beach, huge palm trees hanging over head, like 40-foot palm trees. And there is this gentleman, who is from Brazil. He&amp;rsquo;s a one man band: he&amp;rsquo;s got his drums, his percussion, his keyboard, his guitars. And what he does is he lays down a riff and it records itself so he can lay down the drums of what he wants to do, and then his keyboard sound. Then, he&amp;rsquo;ll put in a little guitar &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s recorded as he&amp;rsquo;s doing it right there. And I got to just sit there and watch the sun go down listening to this amazing musician. And he did a lot of Bossa Nova that night and my favorite moment was &amp;ldquo;So Danco Samba.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;hellip;author of &amp;ldquo;When Elephants Weep&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Pig Who Sang to the Moon&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Dogs Never Lie About Love&amp;rdquo;. Um, now, uh, oh, I guess we have - is it, Jorja Fox is calling now? Okay, Jorja Fox is on the line, Chris DeRose I hope can hold on a little longer now, but Jorja Fox, I know, is in the midst of shooting right now, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, and uh, taking a break. Jorja, welcome to Go Vegan With Bob Linden. It&amp;rsquo;s, ah, great to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much Bob. Hi Chris, how are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris DeRose:&lt;/strong&gt; Good, how are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Very good, very good. Nice to talk to both you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s great to have you both on the line here and, uh, Jorja Fox, ah, people will know from, ah, her work on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. Since ah, since 2000 she&amp;rsquo;s had a starring role there and, actually, anybody who&amp;rsquo;s watched television over the last ten years, um, would know Jorja Fox because she was, ah, on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Missing Persons&amp;rdquo;, um, and now &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. So ah, and Jorja you um, I guess often play, um, characters with a kind of a alternative lifestyle and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing) That&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to put that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and I think (laughing), and I think uh, people want to know, people in the public are curious, if you yourself are a vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I am indeed a vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah-hah! Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; And ah, you know what&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that the character of Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; is a vegetarian, and also when I was on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, the character I played, Dr. Maggie Doyle, was also a vegetarian. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been really lucky that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, did you, um, influence the writers to make it that way? Or um, ah, was it written that way already. I mean, or, or, was it your influence in, in making the characters vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, you know both stories are kind of similar, and they both involve pigs, oddly enough, and my love for pigs, and uh, back in the day on &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, um, the writers had put into the script that my character would practice, you know, doing stitches on a pig&amp;rsquo;s foot, which is sort of a common practice with doctors in residency. And I called the writer who was, y&amp;rsquo;know, there at the time, who&amp;rsquo;s now on &amp;ldquo;Law &amp;amp; Order&amp;rdquo;, and um, and I said to him &amp;lsquo;is there like anything else I might practice on&amp;rsquo;? you know cause I, I just really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do the pig&amp;rsquo;s foot thing, and um, and so then he immediately wrote into the story that my character was a vegetarian and that I was going to be stitching up an eggplant. And then on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; it was a similar thing, we were going to be conducting an experiment on a pig where we&amp;rsquo;re trying to prove how long somebody had been died by sort of, kind of doing the same experiment on a pig, and I called the writers and I said &amp;lsquo;Can we please not, you know, of course we&amp;rsquo;re not going to use a real pig for this, are we&amp;rsquo; and they said &amp;lsquo;oh, are you a vegetarian?&amp;rsquo; and I said &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo; and they wrote it into the story that my character would be a vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Wonderful, yeah-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; and didn&amp;rsquo;t you also influence, like, not using real animals on the show or something to that effect&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Well you know, of course, I, it was more naivety on my part because, you know, they would never use real animals, ah, particularly for any of the dead animals on our show. We&amp;rsquo;ve had some fantastic animal actors come through &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, but all of them have been alive and well and breathing and (laughs) we even have, we use a lot of bugs on the show, and we have, ah, special humane bugs&amp;rsquo; guys that are here to make sure the bugs are taken care of, and that, you know, everybody who arrives on the set leaves the set (laughs) in good shape. So yeah, we do, everybody who&amp;rsquo;s dead on the show whether it&amp;rsquo;s animals, or people of course, are either not real or actors portraying people that are dead, so yeah, no animals have ever been harmed in the making of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; thank goodness, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, that&amp;rsquo;s wonderful, yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s, that&amp;rsquo;s terrific. So um, and, and how did you yourself get interested in, in vegetarianism, and, and animal issues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, wow. Again, I go, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this kind of stuff for so long, y&amp;rsquo;know, I say definitely that when I was a teenager, my grandmother, who&amp;rsquo;s passed away now, she lived a long beautiful life, to 99, uh, I grew up in a very rural town in Florida, and it was obviously very meat and potato oriented and, she, from as long as, y&amp;rsquo;know I grew up with her in the household, she was always very very concerned with the environment, and very, a huge lover of animals, and, and a believer in compassionate, um, treatment towards animals. And so um, from a really early age I was exposed to that, and I would definitely, I would think that she was the person that was most significant in teaching me about that stuff, and I, and I, realized that I, I kinda, I felt the same way that she did, I had the same beliefs as her about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; So, uh, and when did you become vegetarian? Was there a moment&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, I was nineteen years old in New York City, and I was in Brooklyn, and I was eating a meatball hero, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened, I just looked at the sandwich, and I just, it all just clicked in my head, and that was it, I&amp;rsquo;ve never eaten meat again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I was, uh, I was nineteen in New York City and I was looking down at a piece of chicken I just cooked and I said &amp;lsquo;Ah, it&amp;rsquo;s a body!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; No kidding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, it&amp;rsquo;s a-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yuck! Something just all of a sudden, you know, there&amp;rsquo;s just a register there. And you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been really blessed, I lived a lot of big cities, you know it is really easy to have a vegetarian lifestyle in Los Angeles, New York, and places like Chicago, and um, I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful for it, I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful for the knowledge, y&amp;rsquo;know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, definitely. Oh we have, in L.A. we have vegan restaurants everywhere now, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Mmm-hmm. Just in the last couple of years-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; like a (???)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; They&amp;rsquo;re thriving, yeah. I mean, they&amp;rsquo;re, so that&amp;rsquo;s, so that&amp;rsquo;s great. Now, you know, if you, if you look at your acting resume though, I mean, these are amazingly, these are the biggest shows of, of the last few years, and um, how did we get these roles, how uh, how uh does an &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;West Wing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; happen? &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; is like the biggest show, you know that cause there are so many spin-offs on it, you know, so uh, um, how did it, how did it happen for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, thank you, thank you. You know, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I really just think, y&amp;rsquo;know, I really just think I&amp;rsquo;m the luckiest person you know, this, Los Angeles has been really really good to me, everything was kind of just the normal way, like my agent sent me on an audition and I went in, and I had a callback, and then I came back, and I, I feel really really blessed I&amp;rsquo;m uh, right now I&amp;rsquo;m in my eleventh consecutive season on primetime television,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and who knew? I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d get where I am so I&amp;rsquo;m, I&amp;rsquo;m [in] completely uncharted territory. I know, ah, there&amp;rsquo;s other people that are in the club with me but, other than Noah Wyle I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure, I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly who they are. But uh, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s, it&amp;rsquo;s much huger than my wildest dreams I could&amp;rsquo;ve ever thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; So, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t at all the producers in Hollywood were vegan and sympathetic to you necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughs) No, I wish, I wish. That&amp;rsquo;d be pretty fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anything exciting coming up for &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh we&amp;rsquo;re really excited. We premiere September 21st, Thursday mights, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a two-parter episode, ah, that we&amp;rsquo;re going to start the season out with, it&amp;rsquo;s very very high stakes, very traditional, you see most of our season premieres there&amp;rsquo;s, you know, Vegas is highlighted beautifully, a lot of night shots, and, and exteriors, and there&amp;rsquo;s deep deep trouble for Marg Helgenberger&amp;rsquo;s character Catherine Willows, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be quite a thrill ride the first few shows, we&amp;rsquo;re excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Excellent, excellent. Well I&amp;rsquo;m uh, and, and you&amp;rsquo;re shooting today, right now? You, you ran off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m gettin&amp;rsquo; to talk to Bob, which is quite an honor and very rare. Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s uh, you know there&amp;rsquo;s somebody dead and I gotta go check on some dead person, find out what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Well if you ever need, y&amp;rsquo;know like, uh, a dead vegan who needs to lie there, I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to audition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Although, y&amp;rsquo;know, wait a second, vegan and dead don&amp;rsquo;t go together, actually vegan and life go together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly, yeah you&amp;rsquo;re right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; So I guess I&amp;rsquo;m-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Tell you what though, I&amp;rsquo;m going to present that to the producers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I said thank you very much so I&amp;rsquo;m going to present that to the producers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Apparent, yeah, please do that, or, or a live vegan talk show host. Either way, I mean that uh-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay then go back to work then, Jorja Fox. Um by the way, uh, what&amp;rsquo;s the, the spelling of your name is uh, do you need help or uh getting it right or uh-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing) My mother made that up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; How do we, how do we have Jorja from J, O, R, J, A? How did, how did, how did you uh get a spelling like that? What&amp;rsquo;s the derivation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, yeah, for better, for worse, my mom made it up, I&amp;rsquo;m a child of the 70&amp;rsquo;s, and uh, she was from Montreal, French-Canadian, so my name is actually very common there, Jorja-An, and she just threw in the J&amp;rsquo;s to uh, mix it up a little bit and confuse me for like the first twelve years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; (chuckles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; And that made you an actor, so-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, yeah. (laughs) My early childhood pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, your early childhood pain. Well thank you, go back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Bob, thanks Chris, have a, have a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris DeRose:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you, bye-bye Jorja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bob Linden:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll go directly to Chris now I think then? Yes, okay, because Chris has been patiently waiting and Jorja was just taking a quick break from, uh, shooting right now and Chris DeRose who gosh, has been on this show quite often, so you know that he founded and is the president of Last Chance For Animals and um, gosh, he&amp;rsquo;s just one of the heroes in the animal rights movement, but you may not know that on his resume too, well-&lt;/p&gt;
