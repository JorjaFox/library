		<p><strong>You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship. We got &lsquo;em!</strong></p>

<p>William Petersen &ldquo;and&rdquo; Jorja Fox &ldquo;tell all about CSI&rsquo;s biggest mystery yet&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Las Vegas. Sin City.</strong> The night was black as an oil patch left by a perp&rsquo;s getaway car, but the neon lights of the Strip cast a glow on the town tlike a rainbow on a bender. That&rsquo;s when we saw them &hellip; Grissom and Sidle, two CSIs who had no business being in a bedrobe together. The dame wore a robe, like she&rsquo;d just stepped out of the shower. And Grissom &hellip; her boss &hellip; lay on the bed, talking about death.</p>

<p>Turns out relationships that happen in Vegas don&rsquo;t always stay in Vegas. Here&rsquo;s the evidence: In the last scene of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;&rsquo;s May season finale, Gil Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) shocked viewers with their romantic rendezvous. Fan Web sites went nuts. TV GUIDE got lots of letters &#8212; some people liked the relationship; others wanted to send the storyline on a slow boat to China. We had to know: What were the producers thinking?</p>

<p>Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn came clean. This promises to be the most personal season of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; yet. Good thing, too, since it&rsquo;s now going up against TV&rsquo;s sudsiest smash, &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;. &ldquo;The bones of Season 7 will be the toll the job has on our CSIs,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The sin in Sin City is beginning to wear on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next we talked to exec producers Naren Shankar: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to turn into a soap opera, but we&rsquo;re going to see their anger with the world, and them reaching out to each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they really sang like canaries: Turns out &ldquo;all&rdquo; the CSIs will get roughed up this season, in one way or another.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what we got. Now it&rsquo;s your turn. TV GUIDE sat down with Petersen and Fox to ask the &ldquo;your&rdquo; questions (collected on <a href="http://www.tvguide.com">tvguide.com</a>) about all that&rsquo;s happened and what&rsquo;s still to come on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Does the fan response to this new relationship shock you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>William Petersen:</strong> We knew there was a shock value to it because of the little bits and moments that Sara and Grissom have had over the years. So to see them together that way would have impact in terms of, &ldquo;Whoa, there they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I like the mystery of it. It left so many more questions than it really answered. And I think we&rsquo;re all going to figure that out as we go into this season. Billy and I aren&rsquo;t necessarily that far ahead of the audience with this one.</p>

<p><strong>How long have Grissom and Sara been seeing each other?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> We may find out more about that from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you think Grissom so coldly said no to a relationship in earlier seasons but decided to accept it now?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Obviously, this relationship is fraught with danger for Grissom. He and Sara have a mentor-protegee relationship and it&rsquo;d be difficult for anyone in that situation. What one might say one day might not necessarily be how one feels. And what one ends up doing may not be what one thought he or she would be doing.</p>

<p><strong>Please, please, can we have a kiss before all is said and done?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> &ldquo;[Laughing]&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to think we could. We&rsquo;d love to kiss but the network would have to cough up some more money for that. Tongue would cost more. Sometimes they pay you for things that are fun.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Petersen, what were you thinking when you chose to wear that aloha shirt in the Season 6 finale? Did the thought of being shirtless ever cross your mind?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Regarding being shirtless, it never crossed my mind. That aloha shirt has a history. I got it in the Philippines 10 years ago off a guy&rsquo;s back. I traded him shirts in the jungle. For Grissom, it was something different. This is how he lets his hair down when he&rsquo;s with someone he trusts.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Sure, Sara loves Grissom in the buff. But I don&rsquo;t think that was what the scene was about. One of my favorite things was Grissom talking about the nearness of death for these characters. And maybe they go home after the things they&rsquo;ve seen and have some tenderness of their own.</p>

<p><strong>Which character will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s hidden romance?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> Sara and Grissom are not going to let people find out, which makes it even more intense. I don&rsquo;t know who would find out first or how they&rsquo;d react. I do know there are several actors dying to be the one who finds out. &ldquo;[Laughs]&rdquo; Paul Guilfoyle has already gone to the writers saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The chemistry between the entire group seems to be changing &hellip; the bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why?</strong><br />
<strong>Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m sorry the writer feels that way. The writer will be happy to find out there&rsquo;s some Warrick and Nick stuff coming up early in this season.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, you play Sara so well, I wonder if you are like her?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I am probably more like her than any other character I&rsquo;ve played, which is lucky considering that this has been going on for six years. Billy swears that he&rsquo;s acting like Grissom, and that must be exhausting for you &ldquo;[Petersen laughs]&ldquo;. I do like her a lot. She&rsquo;s much smarter than I am. But I also like to focus on one thing for a while. We have OCD in common. I&rsquo;m very idealistic, like Sara.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Lady Heather is Grissom&rsquo;s soul mate?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Petersen:</strong> I think she&rsquo;s his spanking partner. Every now and then a guy needs a good spanking. Lady Heather could teach this country a lot. How to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Definitely how to dress.</p>

<p><strong>Miss Fox, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It would be great if Lady Heather and Sara met. It would be a fun scene to do. When we go places that are sensual, sexual or a bit exotic or scandalous, Sara&rsquo;s never there. She&rsquo;s at the car-wash murder across town &ldquo;[laughs]&ldquo;. So it is a pet peeve of mine that these episodes get written and I&rsquo;m miles away. And I wonder if that&rsquo;s partially control on Grissom&rsquo;s part, since he hands out the cases.</p>

<p><strong>Now that you&rsquo;ll be going up against &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo;, will you be adding more story lines about the personal relationships on the show to attract some of the &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; fans?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I wish them well. It&rsquo;s a great show and a lot of wonderful people are involved.</p>

		<p>You wanted answers about Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship, and we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em. For the occasion of &ldquo;CSI**s Season 7 premiere (tonight at 9 pm/ET), TV Guide brought your burning questions, collected at TVGuide.com,&nbsp;to series stars William Petersen and Jorja Fox. In addition to what follows, look for many more Q&rsquo;s and A&rsquo;s in the new <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/Magazine/default.aspx">TV Guide magazine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Are you surprised that a show that is not knownfor its romantic plots is now getting such a huge reaction for one scene at the end of one episode?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **Very surprised. It&rsquo;s a huge compliment to the show. There&rsquo;s this sense that the folks who have been watching loyally for so long are still really invested in what&rsquo;s happening to the characters. I know there are&nbsp;positive &ldquo;and&rdquo; negative responses, but it&rsquo;s nice to be causing a strong, emotional response.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **We held back on any of that kind of stuff for six years for a reason. If you were going to do something like this a couple of years ago, where would we be now? Probably divorced.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: We know Mr. Petersen will be away for a couple of weeks this season [performing in a play in Providence, Rhode Island]. Do you think Sara will be true to Grissom while he&rsquo;s away?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **I would like to think she would. It&rsquo;s only for a couple of weeks. We&rsquo;re still working on how that&rsquo;s going to unfold.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t know if they even have a monogamous relationship. I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve defined that. It&rsquo;s possible Sara would be true to him, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s definite.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: Knowing that eventually the administration will find out about the relationship, what consequences do you think will be in store for them career-wise? And if they were told to choose between their relationship and their jobs, what do you think they would do?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **I don&rsquo;t know that Grissom has ever been in love, or that he&rsquo;s in love now, so I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to answer that question.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Sara, by virtue of being a realist, is also very much a romantic. So I think if she really was in love with someone, and it came down to a choice between work and love, I think she&rsquo;d go in the direction of love.</p>

<p><strong>Question: If you do not already know, which character do you think will be the first to discover Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s hidden romance?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t really know how to answer that one.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **People call this show a procedural, but it&rsquo;s a procedural that has characters the audience has come to know. As actors, there&rsquo;s a fine line to balance between the show you&rsquo;re doing and what you might like to do with your character. Go too far and it becomes a soap opera, and that&rsquo;s something we won&rsquo;t let happen. That&rsquo;s why the scene at the end of last season was so subtle. It was one camera move, a&nbsp;little conversation. There were people who wanted us to be in bed talking but that was not something we wanted to do. That&rsquo;s not Grissom and Sidle. I don&rsquo;t think they have any idea where their relationship is going. They haven&rsquo;t been able to go to a restaurant together, they can&rsquo;t go out and have a date, because everyone in the place would know us&hellip;. The show is about solving puzzles, to solve things and figure out things. And that&rsquo;s what this is:&nbsp;a puzzle to us and to the audience.</p>

<p>**Fox: **But part of the fun of a puzzle is at least thinking that&nbsp;at some point you&rsquo;ll figure something out. The show does that well.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **There were all kinds of [hints] over the years &#8212; people saw they were flirting &#8212; but that was just between Jorja and I. There were never other people in the scene getting these little tidbits, but the audience got them and was confused by them. Do they like each other? Do they not like each other? Are they doing it, are they not doing it? There was a time, years ago, where they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve flirted around with Grissom and Sara, but it&rsquo;s time for us to stop. This will be a moment, a big moment, and it&rsquo;ll be over.&rdquo; We said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s foolish. We have great chemistry together. We enjoy the banter they have. We enjoy the subtext of all that. Why end it just because you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going to go? Allow us to play whatever it may be, and who knows?&rdquo; So now we&rsquo;ve ended up with this. Had we done what they talked about, we wouldn&rsquo;t be where we are now. If you give it all away, you can&rsquo;t go anywhere from there. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;&nbsp;&#8212; you have a big scene one week, and you&rsquo;re dead the next.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, Sara&rsquo;s character used to lean on Nick in the earlier seasons. What kind of relationship would you like to see for them in the upcoming season?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **I hope that George [Eads] and I get to work together a lot this year. We have a great familiarity and a great sense of humor when we&rsquo;re together.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Sometimes we go through many episodes without working with some of the guys. It&rsquo;s just the way the story lines evolve. [In] the beginning, we were all together on everything, but now they can do whole stories with just one or two of us.</p>

<p><strong>Question: The chemistry between the entire group, in my opinion, seems to be changing. I&rsquo;ve noticed the strong bond that Warrick and Nick had is dwindling. Why do you think that&rsquo;s happening?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **There is less of a camaraderie than there was.</p>

<p>**Fox: **You think so?</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Part of it is because of the growth of the characters. In the beginning, everyone was struggling to do the job right. Now they&rsquo;ve all grown and become very good at it, and there&rsquo;s less opportunity for the chemistry to play. It&rsquo;s&nbsp;like the first few days on a championship baseball team [where] they all have fun in the locker room, they all have fun in the bars. It&rsquo;s a very serious tone on the show, too. The tone has changed over time.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I don&rsquo;t know if I agree. [The episode] &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo; brought everyone back together.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **I&rsquo;m not saying anything about the chemistry &#8212; it&rsquo;s still there &#8212; there&rsquo;s just not as much opportunity to play it. We used to always go into the DNA lab and have fun with Greg. Well, Greg isn&rsquo;t in the lab anymore; he&rsquo;s out in the field, going through all kinds of trials, so he isn&rsquo;t the same fun, happy-go-lucky Greg. George has had a terrible trauma so he&rsquo;s no longer punching Warrick in the shoulder, going, &ldquo;Hey, I bet I can do this better than you can.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re not kids anymore. It&rsquo;s like life in that way.</p>

<p><strong>Question: What has been your favorite episode to film?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **Certainly the Quentin Tarantino episode [&ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo;] was great. That was a full two hours, a big job for everybody.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I really liked &ldquo;A Bullet Runs Through It,&rdquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Parts&nbsp;1 and 2. That was incredibly good.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **The big ones create more memories for us. Sometimes we&rsquo;ll work on a show for&nbsp;eight or&nbsp;nine days, so to spend &ldquo;three weeks&rdquo; on the same story line is great for us. You feel like you were there because it was bigger.</p>

<p>**Fox: **We have a two-parter coming at the start of the [new] season that feels like we have been shooting for three months.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, in his TV Guide interview, Eric Szmanda said that Greg hasn&rsquo;t give up on Sara yet. What do you think Sara&rsquo;s reaction will be once she learns about the deep feelings Greg has for her?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **That question intrigues me because Eric &ldquo;broke up with me&rdquo; in a magazine last summer. We were working a little tension on the show between Greg and Sara, when I read in a magazine that Eric was done with all that. I called him and said, &ldquo;If you want to break up with me, at least do it in person.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so great to have your private relationships play out in the press.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **Isn&rsquo;t that great? Now our characters are in the &ldquo;National Enquirer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Question: Jorja, do you think Sara will ever meet Lady Heather? If so, how would Sara react to her and Grissom&rsquo;s past?</strong></p>

<p>**Fox: **It would be a fun scene to get to do. Sara sat out a lot of the Lady Heather stuff.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **We had this scene where we talked about the guy with the corset damage. Sara asks Grissom where he got his information and he just said, &ldquo;I have my sources.&rdquo; To those who caught that, they&rsquo;ll think he must have learned what he knew from Lady Heather. He doesn&rsquo;t talk to Sara about Lady Heather or his infatuation any more than any guy would discuss his infatuation with another woman while talking to his woman.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Grissom is good at keeping secrets.</p>

<p><strong>Question: If &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is allowed to go for six &ldquo;more&rdquo; years, what would you like, or not like, to see happen?</strong></p>

<p>**Petersen: **How we&rsquo;d raise our 5-year-old baby. [&ldquo;Fox laughs&rdquo;] Less death, I guess. More robberies, fewer murders.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I&rsquo;m determined that when I see gray hair on Eric Szmanda&rsquo;s head, I&rsquo;m leaving. I&rsquo;m done.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **I don&rsquo;t think we can even afford to think like that. When we started, we were on Friday nights at 9 o&rsquo;clock and were just hoping we&rsquo;d see Christmas. We get the scripts two days before we shoot them, so it&rsquo;s pretty hard to think what we&rsquo;d like to do next year.</p>

<p>**Fox: **I will say thanks to the [question] writer for saying that there will be six more years for us.</p>

<p>**Petersen: **When you&rsquo;re first building something, you&rsquo;re fearless because every moment is desperate. Every moment could be your last. When you achieve success over time, you can&rsquo;t live like that anymore, and you don&rsquo;t have to. But then you have to figure out how to stay sharp, and that becomes a very tricky dance.</p>

<p>**Fox: **Every year that we&rsquo;re lucky enough to be on, the statistics make it seem more likely that it&rsquo;ll be our last. But I think we&rsquo;re bringing our game face this year.</p>

		<p><strong>- Feature film will cover animal rights activists&rsquo; trial and conviction -</strong></p>

<p>An animal rights group known as the SHAC7 (Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty) will be sentenced today September 12th on domestic terrorism charges in Trenton, New Jersey. This was a landmark test case for the U.S. government and the first of its kind using the Animal Enterprise Protection Act. The defendants said it was a &#8216;freedom of speech&rsquo; issue, and the U.S. government disagrees and call them &ldquo;thugs&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Producer/director Curt Johnson follows this historic case in his latest film &ldquo;Your Mommy Kills Animals&rdquo;; an indepth look at the animal rights movement and the FBI&rsquo;s recent declaration calling them the &#8216;number one domestic terrorist threat to the United States&rsquo;. Johnson&rsquo;s recent films include the 2002 Academy Award winning documentary &ldquo;Thoth&rdquo;. The film looks at both sides of the animal rights movement.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>The film is slated for a spring 2007 national theatrical release and includes child star Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy from &ldquo;Peanuts&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo;, &ldquo;Odd Couple&rdquo;), Willie Nelson, Moby, Joe Mantegna, Jorja Fox, Drew Carey, Ben Stein among others voicing their opinions on this controversial movement and trial.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox</p>

<p>Name: Jorja Fox</p>

<p>Character: Smitten investigator Sara Sidle on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; (Thursdays at 9 p.m. on WBZ, Ch. 4)</p>

<p>Hometown: Melbourne Beach, Fla.</p>

<p>Age: 38</p>

<p>Where you&rsquo;ve seen her before: Fox was Agent Gina Toscano in &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; and Dr. Maggie Doyle in &ldquo;ER.&rdquo; She also guest starred in the landmark coming-out episode of &ldquo;Ellen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fun fact: She didn&rsquo;t find out that Sara and Grissom (William Petersen) would be revealed to be in a romantic relationship until four days before shooting the scene.</p>

<p>On going up against &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rdquo; this season: &ldquo;There will be very little about our show that will change. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to try to be more like &lsquo;Grey&rsquo;s.&rsquo; I think that would be really foolish of us to do. I think that we&rsquo;ve got a loyal following for what we&rsquo;ve done, and they&rsquo;ve got a really amazing following for what they&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On playing out the Sara and Grissom relationship: &ldquo;You have to think all over again, really who is this person and how would she respond and how would she be in this situation. Because she had a couple of boyfriends that she liked, but her sights have sort of always been on this one man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On how she feels about the Sara and Grissom story line: &ldquo;These two people, they have a lot in common. They&rsquo;re both really not great with people in many respects, and they&rsquo;re emotionally detached in many respects. If two people like that can kind of find each other, there&rsquo;s something really beautiful in that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where you&rsquo;ll see her in five years: Helping to launch the spin-off &ldquo;CSI: Boise.&rdquo;</p>

		<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> &hellip;author of &ldquo;When Elephants Weep&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Pig Who Sang to the Moon&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Dogs Never Lie About Love&rdquo;. Um, now, uh, oh, I guess we have - is it, Jorja Fox is calling now? Okay, Jorja Fox is on the line, Chris DeRose I hope can hold on a little longer now, but Jorja Fox, I know, is in the midst of shooting right now, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, and uh, taking a break. Jorja, welcome to Go Vegan With Bob Linden. It&rsquo;s, ah, great to hear from you.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thank you so much Bob. Hi Chris, how are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Chris DeRose:</strong> Good, how are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Very good, very good. Nice to talk to both you guys.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s great to have you both on the line here and, uh, Jorja Fox, ah, people will know from, ah, her work on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. Since ah, since 2000 she&rsquo;s had a starring role there and, actually, anybody who&rsquo;s watched television over the last ten years, um, would know Jorja Fox because she was, ah, on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Missing Persons&rdquo;, um, and now &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. So ah, and Jorja you um, I guess often play, um, characters with a kind of a alternative lifestyle and&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughing) That&rsquo;s a nice way to put that.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah, and I think (laughing), and I think uh, people want to know, people in the public are curious, if you yourself are a vegetarian?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I am indeed a vegetarian.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Ah-hah! Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> And ah, you know what&rsquo;s interesting is that the character of Sara Sidle on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; is a vegetarian, and also when I was on &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, the character I played, Dr. Maggie Doyle, was also a vegetarian. So I&rsquo;ve been really lucky that way.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Now, did you, um, influence the writers to make it that way? Or um, ah, was it written that way already. I mean, or, or, was it your influence in, in making the characters vegetarian.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, you know both stories are kind of similar, and they both involve pigs, oddly enough, and my love for pigs, and uh, back in the day on &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, um, the writers had put into the script that my character would practice, you know, doing stitches on a pig&rsquo;s foot, which is sort of a common practice with doctors in residency. And I called the writer who was, y&rsquo;know, there at the time, who&rsquo;s now on &ldquo;Law &amp; Order&rdquo;, and um, and I said to him &lsquo;is there like anything else I might practice on&rsquo;? you know cause I, I just really didn&rsquo;t want to do the pig&rsquo;s foot thing, and um, and so then he immediately wrote into the story that my character was a vegetarian and that I was going to be stitching up an eggplant. And then on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; it was a similar thing, we were going to be conducting an experiment on a pig where we&rsquo;re trying to prove how long somebody had been died by sort of, kind of doing the same experiment on a pig, and I called the writers and I said &lsquo;Can we please not, you know, of course we&rsquo;re not going to use a real pig for this, are we&rsquo; and they said &lsquo;oh, are you a vegetarian?&rsquo; and I said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and they wrote it into the story that my character would be a vegetarian.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Wonderful, yeah-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> &#8212; and didn&rsquo;t you also influence, like, not using real animals on the show or something to that effect&hellip;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well you know, of course, I, it was more naivety on my part because, you know, they would never use real animals, ah, particularly for any of the dead animals on our show. We&rsquo;ve had some fantastic animal actors come through &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, but all of them have been alive and well and breathing and (laughs) we even have, we use a lot of bugs on the show, and we have, ah, special humane bugs&rsquo; guys that are here to make sure the bugs are taken care of, and that, you know, everybody who arrives on the set leaves the set (laughs) in good shape. So yeah, we do, everybody who&rsquo;s dead on the show whether it&rsquo;s animals, or people of course, are either not real or actors portraying people that are dead, so yeah, no animals have ever been harmed in the making of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; thank goodness, I&rsquo;m proud to say.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Ah, that&rsquo;s wonderful, yeah, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s terrific. So um, and, and how did you yourself get interested in, in vegetarianism, and, and animal issues?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Um, wow. Again, I go, I&rsquo;ve been doing this kind of stuff for so long, y&rsquo;know, I say definitely that when I was a teenager, my grandmother, who&rsquo;s passed away now, she lived a long beautiful life, to 99, uh, I grew up in a very rural town in Florida, and it was obviously very meat and potato oriented and, she, from as long as, y&rsquo;know I grew up with her in the household, she was always very very concerned with the environment, and very, a huge lover of animals, and, and a believer in compassionate, um, treatment towards animals. And so um, from a really early age I was exposed to that, and I would definitely, I would think that she was the person that was most significant in teaching me about that stuff, and I, and I, realized that I, I kinda, I felt the same way that she did, I had the same beliefs as her about it.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> So, uh, and when did you become vegetarian? Was there a moment&hellip;?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Ah, I was nineteen years old in New York City, and I was in Brooklyn, and I was eating a meatball hero, and I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I just looked at the sandwich, and I just, it all just clicked in my head, and that was it, I&rsquo;ve never eaten meat again.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah. I was, uh, I was nineteen in New York City and I was looking down at a piece of chicken I just cooked and I said &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a body!&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> No kidding!</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> You know, it&rsquo;s a-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yuck! Something just all of a sudden, you know, there&rsquo;s just a register there. And you know, I&rsquo;ve been really blessed, I lived a lot of big cities, you know it is really easy to have a vegetarian lifestyle in Los Angeles, New York, and places like Chicago, and um, I&rsquo;m really grateful for it, I&rsquo;m really grateful for the knowledge, y&rsquo;know?</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah, definitely. Oh we have, in L.A. we have vegan restaurants everywhere now, it seems.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Mmm-hmm. Just in the last couple of years-</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &#8212; like a (???)</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> They&rsquo;re thriving, yeah. I mean, they&rsquo;re, so that&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s great. Now, you know, if you, if you look at your acting resume though, I mean, these are amazingly, these are the biggest shows of, of the last few years, and um, how did we get these roles, how uh, how uh does an &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, &ldquo;West Wing&rdquo; and &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; happen? &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; is like the biggest show, you know that cause there are so many spin-offs on it, you know, so uh, um, how did it, how did it happen for you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh, thank you, thank you. You know, I don&rsquo;t know, I really just think, y&rsquo;know, I really just think I&rsquo;m the luckiest person you know, this, Los Angeles has been really really good to me, everything was kind of just the normal way, like my agent sent me on an audition and I went in, and I had a callback, and then I came back, and I, I feel really really blessed I&rsquo;m uh, right now I&rsquo;m in my eleventh consecutive season on primetime television,</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, and who knew? I never thought I&rsquo;d get where I am so I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m [in] completely uncharted territory. I know, ah, there&rsquo;s other people that are in the club with me but, other than Noah Wyle I&rsquo;m not really sure, I don&rsquo;t know exactly who they are. But uh, yeah, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s much huger than my wildest dreams I could&rsquo;ve ever thought.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> So, so it wasn&rsquo;t at all the producers in Hollywood were vegan and sympathetic to you necessarily.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughs) No, I wish, I wish. That&rsquo;d be pretty fabulous.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anything exciting coming up for &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; this year?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh we&rsquo;re really excited. We premiere September 21st, Thursday mights, you&rsquo;ve got a two-parter episode, ah, that we&rsquo;re going to start the season out with, it&rsquo;s very very high stakes, very traditional, you see most of our season premieres there&rsquo;s, you know, Vegas is highlighted beautifully, a lot of night shots, and, and exteriors, and there&rsquo;s deep deep trouble for Marg Helgenberger&rsquo;s character Catherine Willows, it&rsquo;s gonna be quite a thrill ride the first few shows, we&rsquo;re excited about it.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Excellent, excellent. Well I&rsquo;m uh, and, and you&rsquo;re shooting today, right now? You, you ran off?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah, they&rsquo;ve actually knocked on my trailer door two minutes ago, they want me to go to set and uh, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Tell them, tell them you&rsquo;re on &ldquo;Go Vegan with Bob Linden&rdquo;-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I know, I&rsquo;m a (???)</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> -and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll understand.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; to talk to Bob, which is quite an honor and very rare. Yeah, there&rsquo;s uh, you know there&rsquo;s somebody dead and I gotta go check on some dead person, find out what happened to them.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Okay. Well if you ever need, y&rsquo;know like, uh, a dead vegan who needs to lie there, I&rsquo;ll be glad to audition.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughs)</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Although, y&rsquo;know, wait a second, vegan and dead don&rsquo;t go together, actually vegan and life go together.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Exactly, yeah you&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> So I guess I&rsquo;m-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Tell you what though, I&rsquo;m going to present that to the producers today.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> What&rsquo;s that?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I said thank you very much so I&rsquo;m going to present that to the producers today.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Apparent, yeah, please do that, or, or a live vegan talk show host. Either way, I mean that uh-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Glad to read for it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Sounds good.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Okay then go back to work then, Jorja Fox. Um by the way, uh, what&rsquo;s the, the spelling of your name is uh, do you need help or uh getting it right or uh-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughs)</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> How do you-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (laughing) My mother made that up.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> How do we, how do we have Jorja from J, O, R, J, A? How did, how did, how did you uh get a spelling like that? What&rsquo;s the derivation?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Well, yeah, for better, for worse, my mom made it up, I&rsquo;m a child of the 70&rsquo;s, and uh, she was from Montreal, French-Canadian, so my name is actually very common there, Jorja-An, and she just threw in the J&rsquo;s to uh, mix it up a little bit and confuse me for like the first twelve years of my life.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> (laughs)</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> (chuckles)</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> And that made you an actor, so-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Oh yeah, yeah. (laughs) My early childhood pain.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Yes, your early childhood pain. Well thank you, go back to work.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thanks Bob, thanks Chris, have a, have a beautiful day.</p>

<p><strong>Chris DeRose:</strong> Thank you, bye-bye Jorja.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Bob Linden:</strong> Okay, I&rsquo;ll go directly to Chris now I think then? Yes, okay, because Chris has been patiently waiting and Jorja was just taking a quick break from, uh, shooting right now and Chris DeRose who gosh, has been on this show quite often, so you know that he founded and is the president of Last Chance For Animals and um, gosh, he&rsquo;s just one of the heroes in the animal rights movement, but you may not know that on his resume too, well-</p>
