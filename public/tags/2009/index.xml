      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love the idea of returning as an &amp;ldquo;invitee&amp;rdquo; to &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, she has just returned to the series. Between Jorja Fox and &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat &lt;em&gt;I love you &amp;hellip; me neither&lt;/em&gt;. The 41-year-old actress who plays Sara Sidle welcomes the return to her uniform. Even if her character has changed, including a marriage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TELE STAR: You posed with Marg Helgenberger for some sexy photos. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time that the heroines of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; are just as glamorous?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope that we have been in the past! (She laughs.) But the content requires otherwise. They are usually in jeans and waterproof shoes than an evening gown. And all this is not flattering. I can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s not right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you regret not being able to play the glamor card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;J.F.:&lt;/strong&gt; No. Femininity is primarily a state of the spirit. Anyway, now that Sara, my character is married, she is not supposed to flirt &amp;hellip; (She smiles.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Sara returned to &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, we learned she was married to Grissom. But how do you, since in the United States is no longer seen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;J.F.:&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make problems. Sara has decided to return to help the team. Anyway, she never wanted to be a homemaker. She has never hidden her desire for independence &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you see William Petersen from time to time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;J.F.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, there are still a few weeks, in Los Angeles. When we decided to leave the series, I told him that I wanted to leave first, because I did not want to play [Sara] without him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why did you come back?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;J.F.:&lt;/strong&gt; The proposal the producers made was interesting. I just wanted to have a deadline, because I was involved in other projects. I love the idea of returning to the series as an invitee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are very secretive about your private life. Do you have enough time to think about love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color: #339999;&#34;&gt;J.F.:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure! (She laughs.) I love being in love. This is my problem, I have a hard time and my family points it out often enough to me &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Thursday night (November 19) on CBS at 9pm, one of the most-watched shows on television, CSI (the original version, set in Las Vegas), will air a bowling-themed episode titled &amp;ldquo;Lover&amp;rsquo;s Lane&amp;rdquo; (watch the 30-second promo below) on which yours truly had the pleasure of working as a bowling consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I made my way through the various set-pieces, word of my arrival must have somehow percolated through the building, as everywhere I went I overheard various actors and crew members giddily discussing bowling. In one instance, the gorgeous (and surprisingly tall) Jorja Fox, who plays workaholic Sara Sidle on the show, mentioned how she &amp;ldquo;hates&amp;rdquo; bowling because she &amp;ldquo;sucks at it.&amp;rdquo; I pretty much feel the same way about acting (and those of you who&amp;rsquo;ve seen my show &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Bowling&amp;rdquo; would probably agree with me-that I suck at acting, that is), so Jorja, at least we have that in common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CSI Producer discusses the big crossover, what&amp;rsquo;s coming up in the remaining sweeps episodes of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; and the return of a memorable nemesis. Lights spoilers inside!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November sweeps has already seen the historic first three CSI show crossover, but there&amp;rsquo;s more excitement to come, &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; Producer &amp;ldquo;Allen MacDonald&amp;rdquo; promises. In addition to teasing the episode he&amp;rsquo;s at work on now-which brings back a familiar face-MacDonald discusses the return of Sara Sidle (&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt;), the departure of &lt;strong&gt;Lauren Lee Smith&lt;/strong&gt; and Nick Stokes&amp;rsquo; (&lt;strong&gt;George Eads&lt;/strong&gt;) promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSI Files:&lt;/strong&gt; Sara Sidle sure is spending a lot of time away from her new husband! Are we meant to read anything into that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacDonald:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&amp;rsquo;s always been clear Grissom and Sara would have a non-traditional approach to marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSI Files:&lt;/strong&gt; What was behind the decision to have Sara and Grissom marry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacDonald:&lt;/strong&gt; We felt it was a natural conclusion to where we left them both at the end of &amp;ldquo;One to Go&amp;rdquo; in the rainforest of Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSI Files:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you at work on a new episode now? Can you hint at what it might be about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacDonald:&lt;/strong&gt; I am. And the only hint I can provide is that it would be the completion of a CSI storyline trilogy involving Sara Sidle and a very, very smart young girl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBS couldn&amp;rsquo;t please their millions of fans more. Jorja Fox is back on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. Gone from Las Vegas since season 8, Sara Sidle is back ever since the first episode of season 10, currently airing in the US. There are many reasons to rejoice. TÃTUE.COM will tell you why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallelujah! After two years absence, Jorja Fox is back on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. Thanks to her, the &amp;ldquo;butchest&amp;rdquo; of the &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; girls, Sara Sidle, is back in Vegas in Season 10. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t great new, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what is! Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, Sara Sidle is (almost) &amp;#8216;butch&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to say this? The hair style, the vibes she send when she walks in a room, the displeased look, the sheriff star on her sleeveless vest, the leather jacket, the boots, the hands in her pockets, to add, the gun and that she uses a few judo moves on a suspect who wants nothing to do with her, is a bonus. It explains, Sara calls to us from a subconscious level. She&amp;rsquo;s a delicious &amp;#8216;butch&amp;rsquo; who doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk about it. And it is even more emotional that that she has some difficulties with her relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, but she got married &amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The romance with Gil Grissom, it&amp;rsquo;s been there for a while. Kept secret from the other members of the team, their relationship was clear in the eyes of the public in season 7. But in season 10, its worse, they&amp;rsquo;re married! Except that, and here is where we can relax, it&amp;rsquo;s an &amp;ldquo;unconventional marriage&amp;rdquo;. Understand that Sara and Gil don&amp;rsquo;t live under the same roof. And not even in the same town! &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re a very modern couple,&amp;rdquo; mentions executive producer Carol Mendelsohn in &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve found a balance that permits them to realize themselves in their marriage and in their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re breathing, like we were saying: married women, we know a lot of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And, most of all, Jorja Fox is a bombshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Jorja Fox, Sara Sidle would be nothing. The producers of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; have finally realized it. A little late, sure, but we already know that. Thrown away like a dirty rag in season 8, the woman who also played Maggie Doyle in &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; and Gina Toscano in &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; returned on a carpet of dollars. Planned for only five episodes only, her return is now extended for an &amp;ldquo;unlimited stay&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Jorja has been the cement that permits the links to be rebuilt in the team,&amp;rdquo; recognized Carol Mendelsohn. Yes, people love her! When the first rumors of her departure surfaced in the summer of 2007, tens of thousands of fans would have sent the money to the producers so Jorja wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave. A petition &amp;ldquo;Save Jorja&amp;rdquo; went around on the net and banners with the same message had been tied to planes that flew over Universal Studios. Her most active groupies were, without a doubt, girls! Included in those girls, certain pushed the limit until they created the &amp;ldquo;approved&amp;rdquo; fan club of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s Physique. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Bombshell&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Bomb&amp;rdquo;. First rule of this club is very serious: &amp;ldquo;You must really be a fan of Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s physique. For what other reason would you join?&amp;rdquo; Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because she&amp;rsquo;s vegetarian and she loves baby seals, and every year PETA selects her in its list of &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rsquo;s sexiest Vegetarians.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest puzzler for the &amp;#8216;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rsquo;: How to stop a ratings slide that began with William Petersen&amp;rsquo;s departure last season and has continued into a new season, during which the granddaddy of forensic procedural dramas has lost its crown as TV&amp;rsquo;s top-rated scripted series to &amp;#8216;NCIS&amp;rsquo;? Answer? Stunts, starting with extending Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the show from temporary (five episodes) to indefinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment Weekly&amp;rsquo;s Ausiello Files reports that &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; producers want to keep Fox&amp;rsquo;s Sara Sidle around as long as they can. Executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told EW that Fox&amp;rsquo;s return will last a lot longer than the five episodes initially slated. &amp;ldquo;From our point of view, the more the better,&amp;rdquo; Mendelsohn said. &amp;ldquo;As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mendelsohn said of the mysterious Sara&amp;rsquo;s return to the Las Vegas crime lab, &amp;ldquo;The season is about bringing the [CSI] family back together again,&amp;rdquo; yet that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Sara&amp;rsquo;s husband, Gil Grissom [Petersen], will be coming back as well. Mendelsohn told EW that there are no plans for Petersen to return, but said that future episodes will offer some explanation as to their long-distance marriage. &amp;ldquo;We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Everyone on the team is a little interested. They&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;#8216;What&amp;rsquo;s the deal? Grissom&amp;rsquo;s there, you&amp;rsquo;re here, how does that work?&amp;rsquo; They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship. They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a return visit from Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Grissom, we&amp;rsquo;ll see a three-way series of crossover episodes built around his replacement, Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s Ray Langston. Throughout the second week of November, in the heart of ratings sweeps month (when networks and advertisers give extra scrutiny to audience numbers), Langston will rack up the frequent flyer miles with appearances on all three &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; shows as he tries to solve a murder case that takes him to Florida (&amp;#8216;CSI: Miami,&amp;rsquo; Nov. 9), then Manhattan (&amp;#8216;CSI: NY,&amp;rsquo; Nov. 11), and finally back to Vegas (Nov. 12). Severed limbs, organ trafficking, and prostitution rings will be involved. Fun for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can having Fox&amp;rsquo;s fan-polarizing Sara settle in for a long stay, or Langston&amp;rsquo;s cross-country crime-busting, can return &amp;#8216;CSI&amp;rsquo; to its former ratings glory? Or do you think Mendelsohn and co. will have to persuade Petersen (like Fox) to return from his self-imposed exile? And if he does, will that strike fans as a brilliant move or a desperate one?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think we all saw this coming, right? The return of Sara Sidle (uhh, Grissom) cannot be just for five episodes this season. Now, it has been confirmed that Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to the current season of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; will be indefinite, which means we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of her than we initially thought this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This season is about bringing the family back together again,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Carol Mendelsohn told &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s Michael Ausiello. &amp;ldquo;Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From our point of view, the more [episodes], the better,&amp;rdquo; she added. &amp;ldquo;As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the extension of Fox&amp;rsquo;s stay doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean a return to CSI for William Petersen, who played her former supervisor (and current husband) Gil Grissom. Future episodes will address the unusual living arrangement between the two: Grissom teaching in Paris, and Sara solving crimes in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,&amp;rdquo; Mendelsohn said. &amp;ldquo;Everyone on the team is a little interested. They&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;#8216;What&amp;rsquo;s the deal? Grissom&amp;rsquo;s there, you&amp;rsquo;re here, how does that work?&amp;rsquo; They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship. They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Question: I’m thrilled Jorja Fox is sticking with &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, but what about William Petersen? I want to see Grissom and Sara &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ndash;Alex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; They &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; just together, albeit off screen. As exec producer Carol Mendelsohn tells me, Sara will reveal in this week’s episode that she “just got back from visiting Grissom in Paris.” Mendelsohn adds that, “We have no plans for Billy to return at the moment, but the door’s always open.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This long-distance marriage thing seems to be working for Grissom and Sara on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. Exec producer Carol Mendelsohn confirms to me exclusively that Jorja Fox’s five-episode comeback has been extended &lt;em&gt;indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja,” says Mendelsohn. “The season is about bringing the [&lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;] family back together again, so [this] was just a natural. Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact number of episodes that Fox will appear in is still being worked out, but Mendelsohn says it’s substantially more than five. “From our point of view, the more the better,” she says. “As many episodes as we can have Jorja for we want her for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the extension, Mendelsohn says there are no current plans for Grissom (William Petersen) to join his wife in Las Vegas. Upcoming episodes will shed light on the couple’s unconventional living arrangement. “We will address the fact that Grissom is somewhere else and Sara is living in Vegas,” she reveals. “Everyone on the team is a little interested. They’re like, ‘What’s the deal? Grissom’s there, you’re here, how does that work?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are a very modern couple and they have a very healthy relationship,” Mendelsohn elaborates. “They have found a balance in their life that allows them to still feel fulfilled in their marriage and their careers. If it works for them, it works for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox will be returning to &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; this season indefinitely, TVGuide.com has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We will be seeing a lot more of Jorja,&amp;rdquo; executive producer Carol Mendolsohn tells EW. &amp;ldquo; This season is about bringing the [&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;] family back together again &amp;hellip; Jorja has been the glue that has really helped to reform the bond of our team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of Fox&amp;rsquo;s stay remains unknown but it will definitely be more than the five episodes she was originally scheduled for. &amp;ldquo;As many episodes as we can have Jorja for, we want her for,&amp;rdquo; Mendolsohn told EW, which was the first to report the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; in 2007 but has returned to the show multiple times since. Her character, Sarah Sidle, is married to former team leader Gil Grissom, played by William Peterson. Peterson left the show last season and will not be returning to the show to coincide with his on-screen wife&amp;rsquo;s appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox, who we will soon see back on &amp;ldquo;CSI,&amp;rdquo; guest stars as housewife in jail in desperate need of legal services on &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Drop Dead Diva&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Sunday, Lifetime, 9 p.m.). Do you remember a few years ago, when &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; acted like they didn&amp;rsquo;t need Jorja Fox or George Eads and that basically the cast was replaceable a la &amp;ldquo;Law &amp;amp; Order?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that this hasn&amp;rsquo;t turned out to be the case. The show has suffered in the ratings since all the cast changes. My fearless prediction &amp;ndash; Fox will soon be back as a full-time member of the cast.&lt;/p&gt;

Your gorgeous &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; cover (&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;) proves what I&amp;rsquo;ve known all along: Jorja Fox is the sexiest woman on the show! Now if only the producers would bring her Sara back full-time as a lab tech and kick brown-noser Hodges to the curb. Welcome back, Jorja. We&amp;rsquo;ve really missed you.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;strong&gt;Maureen from N.Y.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have been counting the days till Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ever since it was announced in July that she&amp;rsquo;d be back. Now you put the lovely duo of Jorja and Marg Helgenberger on your cover in their sexiest photo shoot yet? Sweet!&amp;rdquo; - &lt;strong&gt;Shane from N.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;: I went to bed Thursday night thinking, &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to ask Matt what he thinks of &lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/&#34;&gt;http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/&lt;/a&gt; CSI]&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rsquo; and then Friday I saw there was a &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/csi/sara-is-back-2548.html&#34;&gt;http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/csi/sara-is-back-2548.html&lt;/a&gt; recap] by Neil Turitz and found it SO RIGHT ON that I commented right away. I&amp;rsquo;d always loved the show and had high hopes for it after Gil left, thinking Laurence Fishburne would bring something different to the mix and the rest of the wonderful cast was still there (Sara had left already) so I gave it my all but it didn&amp;rsquo;t give back. I kept watching, hoping, cause nobody likes to see an old friend get sick and die, but it was losing me emotionally, and then came the return last night and &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; is really the word for it. I found it had gotten back its sizzle and excitement. Having Sara back and talking about Grissom and that they&amp;rsquo;re married and she&amp;rsquo;s just there because they were shorthanded and he&amp;rsquo;s doing a seminar made it seem so right, and the wild stop-action opening, and the what&amp;rsquo;s-in-that-body closing, added even more sizzle, as did the story that kept me guessing, the way their stories used to. Ray is now more into forensics, Catherine looked awful (green blond STRAIGHT HAIR) but I thought it was in keeping with her being &amp;ldquo;in charge&amp;rdquo; and overwhelmed, and forgetting what Sara so perfectly said that the thing missing is HER, and Nick now being into spiders, and Greg feeling he was the bottom man on the totem pole yet doing a great job on a supposedly unrelated case, even telling the bored cop how important it all was. I was SO delighted. I really think &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; (not just Sara) is BACK. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it stays exciting and fresh and fun, and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what you, my favorite critic, think of the NEW &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Dorothy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Roush&lt;/strong&gt;: From the dazzling opening tableau to that tease at the end, it was a very satisfying way to start the season. (Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s already the 10th!) Sara coming back, even for a limited run, is a very good thing, and so was the off-camera departure of Riley, who never quite fit in. Promoting Langston, hopefully making him more pro-active this season, was also a necessary move. Everyone knew going in that last season would be a transitional and probably rocky one for the show, but Thursday&amp;rsquo;s opener reminded us that how solid the mothership of this franchise still is. But the competition this year is outrageous, and I&amp;rsquo;m afraid many weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll be catching up with these episodes the next day or over the weekend. The mantra I heard in the office over and over on Friday: &amp;lsquo;Thursdays are going to kill me!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights of the Week Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All times listed are Eastern Standard Time for September 28- October 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how sometimes I have to remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m only watching a TV show and the characters aren&amp;rsquo;t real? That&amp;rsquo;s EXACTLY how I felt when we found out Sara and Grissom are married on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (Thursday, CBS, 9 p.m.). I was so happy that those two crazy kids had finally found a way to make it work. Such good times. But other than that the episode still felt a little off to me. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure the show has found the right balance in the post-Grissom world. This week, the team investigates the murder of a porn producer and a drug dealer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; Trifecta: &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;CSI: NY&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;CSI: Miami&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mothership clearly had the strongest opening, with that stellar freeze-frame shot that traveled all through the lab, water droplets floating in the air, bullets rippling by. It was visually arresting, almost like a comic book come to life. So some actress died. The sad thing about being a procedural fan is that there are so many things you&amp;rsquo;re hip to, that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;ndash;like the fact that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cast Cromatie (Garret Dillahunt) from &lt;em&gt;Sarah Conner&lt;/em&gt; unless he was doing some dirty. I&amp;rsquo;m curious, though: How do people feel about Sara (Jorja Fox) becoming Mrs. Grissom? I dig it, I just wish Jorja would figure out whether she&amp;rsquo;s coming or going. All of this on-off mess is too much for a relationship. They either need to bring her back on as a regular, or cut the tie. This is getting a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sara returns to a team in transition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting through the remains from the wood chipper clearly brought back memories for Nick and special guest star Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox). Lord knows how many car trunks they&amp;rsquo;ve opened that contained human soup. I always enjoy Sara coming back to the show. She&amp;rsquo;s badly needed right now. She did come bearing some news: she and Grissom are married now and living in Paris. It was somewhat surprising considering we never got to see them get married. No wedding photos were offered for show-and-tell. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a wedding flashback in a future episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;CSI**s season openers are never this packed with action and character developments. It&amp;rsquo;s generally same ol&amp;rsquo;, same ol&amp;rsquo;. It made for a very interesting night, even if I did find a few faults with the way things developed. With the dismissal of Riley, the promotions of Langston and Nick, and Sara Sidle&amp;rsquo;s recurring guest spots, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; seems to have everything in order to start the season off on a positive note.&lt;/p&gt;
