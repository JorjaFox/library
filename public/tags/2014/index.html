		<p>Jorja Fox at the 30th Annual IDA Documentary Awards Gala #IDAawards</p>

<p><strong>Quinn Marie:</strong> So what brings you out today? You are presenting, correct?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I am presenting best episodic series and best limited series, TV awards, which should be kind of fun.</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> Very cool. And you recently narrated a documentary, correct?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> You know, I have actually. Thanks for knowing that! Actually a bit ago I narrated a documentary about Gidget. One of the first female surfers in California. I produced a couple of documentaries and most of those are wildlife based. Lion Ark, Extinction Soup, and How I Became an Elephant.</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> Awesome. Working in television and documentaries, what is the different process that you go through initially?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Entirely different process. Obviously usually with television you&rsquo;re dealing with a script- at least in my world! I&rsquo;m not part of reality television or news television. And so you&rsquo;ll develop a script for a really long time and then hopefully somebody will be interested in it. And I think with documentaries, at least for me so far, someone has just had an idea and a camera and decided that they had a story that they needed to tell, and almost started the process of telling it without even knowing where it was going to end up, or what the results were going to be. Those are the projects that I&rsquo;ve been a part of so far. I think there can be pre-production in documentaries. People sit down and they kind of scope it out. But so far ours have just sort of been like run and wing it.</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> Very cool. Do you plan on doing more in the future?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I hope so, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying it. It&rsquo;s a fun thing to do.</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> And then &hellip; Robert Redford is being honored tonight. He&rsquo;s kind of been the founder of Sundance-</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Do you see my boots shaking?</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> Are you a- Obviously you a fan, yes?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yes. You know, I think everybody has a couple heroes in their lives. For many, many people, Robert Redford is one of those people. He&rsquo;s absolutely one of mine from the time that I can remember. I am a huge, huge &#8212; not only fan of his but he&rsquo;s been a personal hero for me. So yeah, it&rsquo;s going to be incredibly exciting to see him. An honor he clearly deserves, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to be fun to see.</p>

<p><strong>QM:</strong> That&rsquo;s so cool. Thank you so much, have fun tonight!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Alright, thank you.</p>

		<p><strong>Robert Piper: What inspires you?</strong></p>

<p>Jorja Fox: Wow. I think I&rsquo;m very easily inspired. People, wildlife, nature, music, art. I think that I&rsquo;m lucky that I have this great sense of wonderment about life in general.</p>

<p><strong>RP: How do you stay healthy?</strong></p>

<p>JF: I like to think I&rsquo;m healthy. I exercise a lot. I have this great dog, and I walk her about five days a week. I dance, I surf. I eat mostly vegan, try to get enough sleep. For me, that&rsquo;s really critical.</p>

<p><strong>RP: What kind of research goes into a role?</strong></p>

<p>JF: Well, it depends. For instance, [on] <em>CSI</em> is a character that I had very, very little experience with when I started, so I did a lot of research. I went to the Los Angeles crime lab; I went to the Las Vegas crime lab. Spent some time with folks that really do the job. I did a lot of reading and&ndash;thank goodness for the Internet at that time&ndash;a lot of web searches about the idea of it. Science is not something that comes all that natural to me, and then, of course, every once in a while, you&rsquo;ll get that character that I feel, like, Oh, I know this person or This person would be a good friend of mine or This person&rsquo;s a lot like me. Then, of course, there&rsquo;s less research involved.</p>

<p><strong>RP: What projects are you working on right now?</strong></p>

<p>JF: Right now, I&rsquo;m doing the fifteenth season of <em>CSI</em>. We premiere September 28, so [I&rsquo;m] kind of getting excited. It&rsquo;s always nice to be off the air, to just sort of be away somewhere, working quietly, and then it&rsquo;s really exciting to actually get back on the air and get that adrenaline rush every week. I&rsquo;m looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I produced a couple of documentaries recently. One of them is called <em>Lion Art</em>, and the other one&rsquo;s called <em>Extinction Soup</em>. Both of those documentaries are on the film-festival circuit right now. <em>Lion Art</em> deals with transporting twenty-five former circus lions from Bolivia to a wildlife sanctuary outside of Denver, Colo. <em>Extinction Soup</em> is kind of a combination of stories, but the primary purpose of the film is to sort of tell the tale of shark-fin soup and what it&rsquo;s doing to the oceans and to shark habitats across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>RP: How do you find balance in life?</strong></p>

<p>JF: It&rsquo;s really about being outside, being in nature. I can kind of go into the wild places and immediately feel rested and rejuvenated. Often, even if I&rsquo;m struggling with a decision or something, if I just go out into the ocean, that answer will come without thinking about it too much. I try to balance work and play. Again, I&rsquo;m really grateful that I can kind of have that philosophy, so I can try to get out of the city as much as possible, even though I love the city and I&rsquo;m not ready to leave it.</p>

<p>*Jorja Fox is an actress and musician. She can currently be seen on the hit show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She has also starred in ER and The West Wing *</p>

		<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Catch up with the <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> star, find out her favorite places in Los Angeles and more.&ldquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Jorja Fox&rsquo;s is not a typical success story. The <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn&rsquo;t in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt. Today, Fox is diving back into a 15th season on <em>CSI</em> as forensic scientist Sara Sidle, and sharing with us her favorite L.A. spots. Listen in.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve been playing the role of Sara on <em>CSI</em> for 14 years. Do you ever think about the show coming to an end?</strong></p>

<p>Every year we think about it a little bit. Most shows are picked up one season at a time, so there&rsquo;s always a moment where you think, âThis could be it.&rsquo; And if it is, then wow, what an amazing ride we&rsquo;ve had. <em>CSI</em> grounds me, and I&rsquo;m so grateful for the work that Sara gets to do. Maybe if we went on for another 14 years I might get tired, but so far, so good! [Laughs] I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve starred on three of the most popular dramas in the history of TV&ndash;<em>ER</em>, <em>The West Wing</em> and <em>CSI</em>. Who&rsquo;s your favorite leading man from each show?</strong></p>

<p>Uh-oh! [Laughs] I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to work with so many amazing leading men. First is Noah Wyle from <em>ER</em>. He&rsquo;s amazingly charming, shy and an incredibly intelligent guy. On <em>The West Wing</em>, I&rsquo;m going with DulÃ© Hill. He&rsquo;d break into dance at any given time during filming. I really enjoyed that, and him! For <em>CSI</em>, I&rsquo;ll say Eric Szmanda, who plays Sanders. Eric was barely legal when he first started on the show.</p>

<p><strong>You also appeared on the historic coming-out episode of Ellen. Did you realize the importance of that moment at the time?</strong></p>

<p>[Back then,] it was a really big deal, and it was a really, really big deal for Ellen [DeGeneres]. I think I was asked to do it because my character on <em>ER</em> was a lesbian. It was a moment in my life that I was really proud to be a part of, and it has been so great to see Ellen be even more huge now.</p>

<p><strong>In honor of our arts and culture issue, what are your favorite places to see live music?</strong></p>

<p>I love the Greek Theatre. It&rsquo;s open, it&rsquo;s intimate, and the sound is really good. I love the Disney Concert Hall. The sound is legendary. For smaller venues, I love the Hotel Cafe and Satellite. [They book] bands that are just sort of entering the scene.</p>

<p><strong>And I hear you&rsquo;re quite the budding musician!</strong></p>

<p>But I have no natural talent! I&rsquo;ve played guitar on and off since I was 14, and I took up the drums five years ago, but I&rsquo;m terrible! I&rsquo;ll practice, but I honestly thought I was tone-deaf for a long time. I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m just really bad. But I love it, and I&rsquo;ll [play] with friends every once in a while on a Friday night. Thank goodness I&rsquo;m not trying to actually make a living at it.</p>

<p><strong>Describe your perfect day.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have breakfast at Sage on the Silver Lake/Echo Park border. It&rsquo;s a plant-based restaurant, and they have amazing smoothies and green drinks. They have this great ice cream counter and all the flavors technically are vegan. Then I would head to Descanso Gardens. I love to go seasonally because it&rsquo;s filled with native flowers. And the Theodore Payne Nursery, which sells native and indigenous plants to California. I love the Ace Hotel downtown for cocktails after dark. The bar is beautiful. I also love to go to the downtown Standard for drinks up on the roof. They have a beautiful view. There&rsquo;s also a restaurant called The Must with a whole bunch of comfort food. They have a ton of vegetarian options and great wine. It&rsquo;s a little off the beaten path. When it comes to shopping, I love going to the [local] surf shop or REI. I also love to hike, and I love Commonwealth near Griffith Park. Once you get to the top, there are trails that go for hours. You can connect yourself to the Hollywood sign. There&rsquo;s parking and it&rsquo;s dog-friendly, too.</p>

		<p><strong>Tiffany Paige:</strong> We&rsquo;re here with actress Jorja Fox from CSI. What brings you here tonight?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;m very excited about this event, it&rsquo;s an event very close to my heart. I&rsquo;m representing Artists &amp; Athletes tonight. I&rsquo;m on the advisory board and we&rsquo;re a collective of artists and athletes that connect with Washington DC on issues that are close to everybody. Kind of create a dialogue between the different camps and bring us together to get things that we care about on the floor and up for conversation.</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> That&rsquo;s so important. Are you an athlete yourself?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I&rsquo;m a surfer. I don&rsquo;t know if that really counts.</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> Of course that counts. [&hellip;] Do you have a green tip? Is there something that you could tell our viewers?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Okay, well I&rsquo;m going out on the edge here, but I&rsquo;d like to take &ldquo;Meatless Mondays&rdquo; into three more days a week. Probably the single-handed biggest thing that any individual can do to really help the environment is to eat vegetarian. And maybe not all the time, but even just more would make a huge difference.</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> That is a good one. So are you a vegetarian?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> I am, yes.</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> How long have you been a vegetarian?</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Like &hellip; twenty-two years?</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> Wow!</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Yeah like that. You know, for me it&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t even think about anymore. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; it&rsquo;s not complicated, it&rsquo;s not hard. [&hellip;] In terms of raising cattle and raising food, the water that gets used and the land that gets sort of clear-cut to make that happen&hellip; you don&rsquo;t think about that when- I mean, why would we?</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think people put faces to their food. How that works, where their food comes from. That is a great one, thank you for that tip.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Thanks Tiffany.</p>

<p><strong>TP:</strong> Have a great night.</p>

<p><strong>JF:</strong> Alright, you too.</p>

		<p>It is hard to believe the &ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; writers specifically meant for an episode surrounding panic around an Ebola-like virus to land on the schedule exactly when Ebola panic has permeated the US consciousness at yet to be matched levels of cable news attention. Even so, with multiple references to Ebola in the first fifteen minutes alone, the comparisons are too timely and specific to be a complete coincidence.</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s episode &ldquo;Bad Blood&rdquo; (Oct. 12) centers around the death of a former viral researcher and doctor found in his home by Sara and Greg. A bullet to the head after a long battle with the unknown illness originally masks the cause of death, exposing the two investigators to a disease with an 80% mortality rate and no know cure.</p>

<p>The way the show embraces the panic and rural outbreaks of Ebola is part shameless co-opting of a real problem for drama&rsquo;s sake and part easy promotion for the veteran show. Much of the episode is a Mad Libs version of any contagion movie or show, but mines some emotional material from the case that it rarely gets to do outside of a season finale.</p>

<p>Greg&rsquo;s video call to his grandmother is sweet, but it is he and Sara&rsquo;s conversation that spurs the call that gets at the heart of why the connections between the CSI&rsquo;s are still so potent after so many years on the air. Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda are entwined in the fabric of the show, and their mutual reflection on what they&rsquo;ve left unfinished in life is poignant in a way that many procedurals are unable to reach in such a true way. As the final scene proves it may be obvious that these team members love each other, but it is nice for the show to remind everyone of such every now and then.</p>

<p>Ted Danson is at his best when he is in &ldquo;protect the team&rdquo; mode, and even though he takes part in minimal field work this episode he has the chance to take a bite out of suspects when they stand between Russell&rsquo;s investigation and the team&rsquo;s safety.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t stage a major outbreak before the case is solved or kill Sara off without promoting Jorja Fox&rsquo;s sendoff day and night for a month, and in fact the outcome is obvious from early on. Even so, there are enough suspense-filled and relationship-building moments that they more than outweigh the lack of surprising developments in the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI:Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on CBS.</p>
