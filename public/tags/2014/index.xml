      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox at the 30th Annual IDA Documentary Awards Gala #IDAawards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quinn Marie:&lt;/strong&gt; So what brings you out today? You are presenting, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I am presenting best episodic series and best limited series, TV awards, which should be kind of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; Very cool. And you recently narrated a documentary, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I have actually. Thanks for knowing that! Actually a bit ago I narrated a documentary about Gidget. One of the first female surfers in California. I produced a couple of documentaries and most of those are wildlife based. Lion Ark, Extinction Soup, and How I Became an Elephant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; Awesome. Working in television and documentaries, what is the different process that you go through initially?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Entirely different process. Obviously usually with television you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a script- at least in my world! I&amp;rsquo;m not part of reality television or news television. And so you&amp;rsquo;ll develop a script for a really long time and then hopefully somebody will be interested in it. And I think with documentaries, at least for me so far, someone has just had an idea and a camera and decided that they had a story that they needed to tell, and almost started the process of telling it without even knowing where it was going to end up, or what the results were going to be. Those are the projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of so far. I think there can be pre-production in documentaries. People sit down and they kind of scope it out. But so far ours have just sort of been like run and wing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; Very cool. Do you plan on doing more in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope so, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really enjoying it. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; And then &amp;hellip; Robert Redford is being honored tonight. He&amp;rsquo;s kind of been the founder of Sundance-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you see my boots shaking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you a- Obviously you a fan, yes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. You know, I think everybody has a couple heroes in their lives. For many, many people, Robert Redford is one of those people. He&amp;rsquo;s absolutely one of mine from the time that I can remember. I am a huge, huge &amp;#8212; not only fan of his but he&amp;rsquo;s been a personal hero for me. So yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be incredibly exciting to see him. An honor he clearly deserves, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s going to be fun to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QM:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s so cool. Thank you so much, have fun tonight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Piper: What inspires you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox: Wow. I think I&amp;rsquo;m very easily inspired. People, wildlife, nature, music, art. I think that I&amp;rsquo;m lucky that I have this great sense of wonderment about life in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RP: How do you stay healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JF: I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m healthy. I exercise a lot. I have this great dog, and I walk her about five days a week. I dance, I surf. I eat mostly vegan, try to get enough sleep. For me, that&amp;rsquo;s really critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RP: What kind of research goes into a role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JF: Well, it depends. For instance, [on] &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; is a character that I had very, very little experience with when I started, so I did a lot of research. I went to the Los Angeles crime lab; I went to the Las Vegas crime lab. Spent some time with folks that really do the job. I did a lot of reading and&amp;ndash;thank goodness for the Internet at that time&amp;ndash;a lot of web searches about the idea of it. Science is not something that comes all that natural to me, and then, of course, every once in a while, you&amp;rsquo;ll get that character that I feel, like, Oh, I know this person or This person would be a good friend of mine or This person&amp;rsquo;s a lot like me. Then, of course, there&amp;rsquo;s less research involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RP: What projects are you working on right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JF: Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m doing the fifteenth season of &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. We premiere September 28, so [I&amp;rsquo;m] kind of getting excited. It&amp;rsquo;s always nice to be off the air, to just sort of be away somewhere, working quietly, and then it&amp;rsquo;s really exciting to actually get back on the air and get that adrenaline rush every week. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I produced a couple of documentaries recently. One of them is called &lt;em&gt;Lion Art&lt;/em&gt;, and the other one&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;Extinction Soup&lt;/em&gt;. Both of those documentaries are on the film-festival circuit right now. &lt;em&gt;Lion Art&lt;/em&gt; deals with transporting twenty-five former circus lions from Bolivia to a wildlife sanctuary outside of Denver, Colo. &lt;em&gt;Extinction Soup&lt;/em&gt; is kind of a combination of stories, but the primary purpose of the film is to sort of tell the tale of shark-fin soup and what it&amp;rsquo;s doing to the oceans and to shark habitats across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RP: How do you find balance in life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JF: It&amp;rsquo;s really about being outside, being in nature. I can kind of go into the wild places and immediately feel rested and rejuvenated. Often, even if I&amp;rsquo;m struggling with a decision or something, if I just go out into the ocean, that answer will come without thinking about it too much. I try to balance work and play. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful that I can kind of have that philosophy, so I can try to get out of the city as much as possible, even though I love the city and I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Jorja Fox is an actress and musician. She can currently be seen on the hit show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. She has also starred in ER and The West Wing *&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Catch up with the &lt;em&gt;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&lt;/em&gt; star, find out her favorite places in Los Angeles and more.&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s is not a typical success story. The &lt;em&gt;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&lt;/em&gt; staple is in her 19th consecutive prime-time television season, a rarity in Hollywood. But acting almost wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the cards for Fox, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist or oceanographer. That passion led to her development of Seafox Productions, which has three wildlife documentaries under its belt. Today, Fox is diving back into a 15th season on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; as forensic scientist Sara Sidle, and sharing with us her favorite L.A. spots. Listen in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve been playing the role of Sara on &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; for 14 years. Do you ever think about the show coming to an end?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year we think about it a little bit. Most shows are picked up one season at a time, so there&amp;rsquo;s always a moment where you think, âThis could be it.&amp;rsquo; And if it is, then wow, what an amazing ride we&amp;rsquo;ve had. &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; grounds me, and I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful for the work that Sara gets to do. Maybe if we went on for another 14 years I might get tired, but so far, so good! [Laughs] I&amp;rsquo;ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve starred on three of the most popular dramas in the history of TV&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;ER&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. Who&amp;rsquo;s your favorite leading man from each show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh! [Laughs] I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to work with so many amazing leading men. First is Noah Wyle from &lt;em&gt;ER&lt;/em&gt;. He&amp;rsquo;s amazingly charming, shy and an incredibly intelligent guy. On &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m going with DulÃ© Hill. He&amp;rsquo;d break into dance at any given time during filming. I really enjoyed that, and him! For &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll say Eric Szmanda, who plays Sanders. Eric was barely legal when he first started on the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also appeared on the historic coming-out episode of Ellen. Did you realize the importance of that moment at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Back then,] it was a really big deal, and it was a really, really big deal for Ellen [DeGeneres]. I think I was asked to do it because my character on &lt;em&gt;ER&lt;/em&gt; was a lesbian. It was a moment in my life that I was really proud to be a part of, and it has been so great to see Ellen be even more huge now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In honor of our arts and culture issue, what are your favorite places to see live music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the Greek Theatre. It&amp;rsquo;s open, it&amp;rsquo;s intimate, and the sound is really good. I love the Disney Concert Hall. The sound is legendary. For smaller venues, I love the Hotel Cafe and Satellite. [They book] bands that are just sort of entering the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I hear you&amp;rsquo;re quite the budding musician!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have no natural talent! I&amp;rsquo;ve played guitar on and off since I was 14, and I took up the drums five years ago, but I&amp;rsquo;m terrible! I&amp;rsquo;ll practice, but I honestly thought I was tone-deaf for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;m not, I&amp;rsquo;m just really bad. But I love it, and I&amp;rsquo;ll [play] with friends every once in a while on a Friday night. Thank goodness I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to actually make a living at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe your perfect day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d have breakfast at Sage on the Silver Lake/Echo Park border. It&amp;rsquo;s a plant-based restaurant, and they have amazing smoothies and green drinks. They have this great ice cream counter and all the flavors technically are vegan. Then I would head to Descanso Gardens. I love to go seasonally because it&amp;rsquo;s filled with native flowers. And the Theodore Payne Nursery, which sells native and indigenous plants to California. I love the Ace Hotel downtown for cocktails after dark. The bar is beautiful. I also love to go to the downtown Standard for drinks up on the roof. They have a beautiful view. There&amp;rsquo;s also a restaurant called The Must with a whole bunch of comfort food. They have a ton of vegetarian options and great wine. It&amp;rsquo;s a little off the beaten path. When it comes to shopping, I love going to the [local] surf shop or REI. I also love to hike, and I love Commonwealth near Griffith Park. Once you get to the top, there are trails that go for hours. You can connect yourself to the Hollywood sign. There&amp;rsquo;s parking and it&amp;rsquo;s dog-friendly, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Paige:&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re here with actress Jorja Fox from CSI. What brings you here tonight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about this event, it&amp;rsquo;s an event very close to my heart. I&amp;rsquo;m representing Artists &amp;amp; Athletes tonight. I&amp;rsquo;m on the advisory board and we&amp;rsquo;re a collective of artists and athletes that connect with Washington DC on issues that are close to everybody. Kind of create a dialogue between the different camps and bring us together to get things that we care about on the floor and up for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s so important. Are you an athlete yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m a surfer. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that really counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course that counts. [&amp;hellip;] Do you have a green tip? Is there something that you could tell our viewers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, well I&amp;rsquo;m going out on the edge here, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to take &amp;ldquo;Meatless Mondays&amp;rdquo; into three more days a week. Probably the single-handed biggest thing that any individual can do to really help the environment is to eat vegetarian. And maybe not all the time, but even just more would make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; That is a good one. So are you a vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; I am, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; How long have you been a vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Like &amp;hellip; twenty-two years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah like that. You know, for me it&amp;rsquo;s something I don&amp;rsquo;t even think about anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s just&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s not complicated, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard. [&amp;hellip;] In terms of raising cattle and raising food, the water that gets used and the land that gets sort of clear-cut to make that happen&amp;hellip; you don&amp;rsquo;t think about that when- I mean, why would we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think people put faces to their food. How that works, where their food comes from. That is a great one, thank you for that tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Tiffany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TP:&lt;/strong&gt; Have a great night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JF:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright, you too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/news/2014/zap2it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe the &amp;ldquo; CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; writers specifically meant for an episode surrounding panic around an Ebola-like virus to land on the schedule exactly when Ebola panic has permeated the US consciousness at yet to be matched levels of cable news attention. Even so, with multiple references to Ebola in the first fifteen minutes alone, the comparisons are too timely and specific to be a complete coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s episode &amp;ldquo;Bad Blood&amp;rdquo; (Oct. 12) centers around the death of a former viral researcher and doctor found in his home by Sara and Greg. A bullet to the head after a long battle with the unknown illness originally masks the cause of death, exposing the two investigators to a disease with an 80% mortality rate and no know cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the show embraces the panic and rural outbreaks of Ebola is part shameless co-opting of a real problem for drama&amp;rsquo;s sake and part easy promotion for the veteran show. Much of the episode is a Mad Libs version of any contagion movie or show, but mines some emotional material from the case that it rarely gets to do outside of a season finale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg&amp;rsquo;s video call to his grandmother is sweet, but it is he and Sara&amp;rsquo;s conversation that spurs the call that gets at the heart of why the connections between the CSI&amp;rsquo;s are still so potent after so many years on the air. Jorja Fox and Eric Szmanda are entwined in the fabric of the show, and their mutual reflection on what they&amp;rsquo;ve left unfinished in life is poignant in a way that many procedurals are unable to reach in such a true way. As the final scene proves it may be obvious that these team members love each other, but it is nice for the show to remind everyone of such every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ted Danson is at his best when he is in &amp;ldquo;protect the team&amp;rdquo; mode, and even though he takes part in minimal field work this episode he has the chance to take a bite out of suspects when they stand between Russell&amp;rsquo;s investigation and the team&amp;rsquo;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stage a major outbreak before the case is solved or kill Sara off without promoting Jorja Fox&amp;rsquo;s sendoff day and night for a month, and in fact the outcome is obvious from early on. Even so, there are enough suspense-filled and relationship-building moments that they more than outweigh the lack of surprising developments in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;CSI:Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo; airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on CBS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No one escapes alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what the promo for Sunday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;&amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo; would have us believe. In the preview for &amp;lsquo;Bad Blood&amp;rsquo;, Sara (&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Jorja Fox&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;) and Greg (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Eric Szmanda&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;) aren&amp;rsquo;t looking so hot &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder, as, while investigating a crime scene, they&amp;rsquo;re exposed to a deadly virus with a crushing fatality rate of 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the looks of it, the virus hits one of the pair harder than the other. At one point in the promo, we see a pale, sweaty Sara collapse to the floor while Greg looks on helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Russell (&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Ted Danson&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;) doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to worry about his friends and co-workers, since the pathogen ended up on planes headed to four different continents. Still, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop a concerned Russell from giving the pair direct orders not to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official synopsis for &amp;lsquo;Bad Blood&amp;rsquo; reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sara and Greg are quarantined after responding to a crime scene that&amp;rsquo;s contaminated with a deadly pathogen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are brighter days ahead &amp;ndash; namely, two new love interests (one of whom may turn out to be a little suspicious) and an episode that takes a trio of CSI ladies to Las Vegas. &amp;ldquo;I want to do more girl-focused episodes,&amp;rdquo; Shue told Mashable. &amp;ldquo;I really want to work more with Jorja [Fox], and I think the girl power of CSI needs to be enhanced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETURNS Sunday, Sept 28, 10/9c, CBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;s the wrong man on death row thanks to D.B. Russell? Season 15 has the CSI night-shift chief, played by Ted Danson, dealing with a crisis of conscience, and a threat to his career, when Las Vegas is rattled by a series of murders strikingly similar to those committed by the Gig Harbor Killer &amp;#8212; aka Jared Briscoe (Mark-Paul Gossalaar) &amp;#8212; a sicko Russell put behind bars years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season-long story arc will also &amp;ldquo;threaten the reputation of the entire crime lab,&amp;rdquo; says executive producer Don McGill, who will add to Russell&amp;rsquo;s troubles by bringing in an old foe from the Seattle PD, Daniel Shaw (Mark Valley). A rule-bending, authority-flaunting crime solver, Shaw comes to Vegas in search of his former partner, who went missing while working on a case there. &amp;ldquo;Russell has great reason to distrust him,&amp;rdquo; hints McGill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there&amp;rsquo;s more mayhem, but also a possible romance: A shooter will open fire at a CSI convention, endangering the women of the lab, while Nick (George Eads) uncovers suggestions of the supernatural when he investigates the death of a high school chemistry teacher. &amp;ldquo;Sara [Jorja Fox] and Greg [Eric Szmanda] will face down death, very literally, when a plague scare hits Vegas,&amp;rdquo; says McGill. &amp;ldquo;The event will draw them together, suggesting a closeness we may not have seen before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of this month, *The West Wing *is 15 years old. We&amp;rsquo;ll pause as you absorb how long you&amp;rsquo;ve been without Jed Bartlet and his merry band in your life. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it feel like just yesterday we all fell in love with Aaron Sorkin&amp;rsquo;s bastion of liberal idealism wrapped up in fast-paced dialogue usually said while walking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31. Gina Toscano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Played By:&lt;/strong&gt; Jorja Fox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Episodes:&lt;/strong&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of great Secret Service characters on The West Wing, but no one embodied Gina’s mix of robotic professionalism and sublimated heart that goes into being a bodyguard quite as well. She&amp;rsquo;s always Zoey&amp;rsquo;s chum, a bit of a big sister figure and a fearless soldier who would dive in front of gunfire for her. Toscano&amp;rsquo;s arc ends at the assassination of the season one finale, but every subsequent Secret Service character felt like it was building off of her. – &lt;em&gt;DS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signature Episodes:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;What Kind of Day Has It Been?&amp;rdquo; is told, a little bit, through Gina&amp;rsquo;s keen eyes as she spots the shooters, not quickly enough, who give us our first-season cliffhanger.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago this week, a little hospital show called &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; debuted on NBC to much fanfare and managed to exceed the hype. For years, it was television&amp;rsquo;s #1 drama; it reinvented the television form, bringing a previously-unseen cinematic approach to shooting action in its Chicago hospital setting. And it had one of the deepest, craziest, most lovable ensembles in the history of television, both helped and eventually done in by its excessive longevity. There are so many characters in the history of &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; that of course it&amp;rsquo;d be impossible to rank them all in any kind of definitive way. What&amp;rsquo;s that? Someone&amp;rsquo;s done it? He must have been mad to approach such a task single-handedly. Below follows a ranked consideration of &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s cast, including any recurring hospital employee who made an impact; briefer guest stints were not considered, and neither were peripheral characters like family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;22. Maggie Doyle (Jorja Fox)&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Recurring Seasons 3-5) &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; should have paid to keep Fox around (she departed for &amp;ldquo;The West Wing&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;). Appearing before Weaver came out, she was the show&amp;rsquo;s first major gay character (although her orientation was much more obliquely referenced) and just the kind of admirable no-nonsense physician &amp;ldquo;ER&amp;rdquo; had plenty of in the early seasons. Later years demanded everyone have some kind of crippling personal drama, but Doyle mostly just did her job well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;A DETECTIVE studies the body of George Tabin, a professional Elvis impersonator.&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Tabin, dead on a bus bench, has severe head wounds, but there&amp;rsquo;s no blood around to suggest he was murdered here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara Sidle, played by Jorja Fox, stumbles upon a trail of blood drops, which lead her to where a blackbird &amp;ndash; a rook &amp;ndash; has been stabbed to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, there&amp;rsquo;s a connection between the two deaths. Both the rook and Elvis impersonator (&amp;ldquo;The King&amp;rdquo;) represent chess pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunt for a killer is on when it&amp;rsquo;s realised there&amp;rsquo;s a chess tournament in town.&lt;br /&gt;
It seems remarkable that 14 seasons in, &lt;em&gt;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&lt;/em&gt; is capable of producing such a twisted tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Szmanda, who plays Greg Sanders, always knew he was signing for a hit show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I remember doing the pilot and thinking to myself, why hasn&amp;rsquo;t anybody done this yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Fox has her own theory on why the original drama in the &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; franchise endures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have often thought of our show really as an action-adventure show,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be a mystery-suspense show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And there are a whole bunch of really good reasons to tune in, but one of them is you are going to be in for an amazing ride, an amazing hour of an exciting, dodgy, what&amp;rsquo;s-going-to-happen-next kind of ride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely Fox had no idea &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; would become this monster hit when she signed to play Sidle 13 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know, when I read the script I was blown away by it,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was so different and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen anything ever like it. &amp;ldquo;Quincy&amp;rdquo; was probably the closest thing that I could compare it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought a show about death, this is going to be cancelled in six weeks, like no one is going to watch this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And boy was I extremely wrong about that &amp;ndash; and happily so.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;Actress Jorja Fox:&amp;ldquo;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Since my early 20s, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt I had to wear heels when I get dressed up. You want to look great and you want to be like everyone else, you know? But now that I&amp;rsquo;m in my 40s, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed I care a lot less what people think about me. And when you&amp;rsquo;re 5&amp;rsquo;9&amp;rdquo; and you wear heels, you&amp;rsquo;re towering over almost every woman in the room and half the men. It&amp;rsquo;s always been a little uncomfortable and not that fun. So I&amp;rsquo;ve given it up! I don&amp;rsquo;t feel guilty about showing up at a party or an event in flats anymore. I&amp;rsquo;m more comfortable and I still feel beautiful. So nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m the one looking for cool flats when I&amp;rsquo;m looking at dress shoes. And I don&amp;rsquo;t miss the high heels at all!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Emmy Award-winning actress Jorja Fox stars on CBS&amp;rsquo;s hit show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS, WE&amp;rsquo;VE BEEN WATCHING &lt;strong&gt;JORJA FOX&lt;/strong&gt; ON OUR TELEVISION SETS. HERE&amp;rsquo;S A LOOK AT HOW THE ACTOR SPENDS HER TIME OFF SCREEN, AND WHY SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF ONE LUCKY LADY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox is really the antithesis of her television alter ego Sarah Sidle on the hit show &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;. Whereas Sidle is often sullen and dark, Fox is all smiles and has a bounce in her step that just makes you want to be around her. However both ladies are looking for ways to reinvent themselves. &amp;ldquo;Sara got dumped by her husband last year so she&amp;rsquo;s been grieving,&amp;rdquo; says Fox of the character she&amp;rsquo;s played in close to 300 episodes. &amp;ldquo;She&amp;rsquo;s looking for ways to break out of her shell. I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all been through a break-up; it&amp;rsquo;s part of the peaks and valleys in life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to step outside of her own comfort zone and reinvent herself again, Fox has taken on the role of producer with the animal rescue documentary &lt;em&gt;Lion Ark&lt;/em&gt;. The film reveals a historical move of 25 lions from Libya to a wildlife sanctuary in Colorado. &amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to reinvent yourself over the years,&amp;rdquo; says Fox. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll act for as long as people will have me, however I also want to put my eggs in a couple other baskets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VEGAN WANNABE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area Fox won&amp;rsquo;t be reinventing herself is her diet. The actor has been a disciplined vegetarian for the past 20 years. &amp;ldquo;Eating meat-free is second nature to me,&amp;rdquo; she says. Fox describes herself as a vegan wannabe. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m vegan 85 per cent of the time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox eats healthy and considers rice pasta with vegan meatloaf her comfort dish. &amp;ldquo;I made a vegan meatloaf a couple months ago. Unfortunately I blew it &amp;mdash; it came out looking like chili,&amp;rdquo; she laughs. &amp;ldquo;It was tasty though.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox does make minor adjustments to her diet in an attempt to improve her health. For example, she switched from early morning coffee to green or black tea. Aware that omega-3 fatty acids are important to her well being, Fox now takes a vegan source of omega-3s daily. She also supplements with a multi, pro-biotic and magnesium and calcium vegetarian capsule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early morning before heading out to work or surf, Fox has a green smoothie. &amp;ldquo;Kale, lettuce, spinach, chard, a little fruit, and nuts for protein such as walnuts, almonds or cashews, flaxseed or chia seeds.&amp;rdquo; She also eats a sweet something for breakfast. &amp;ldquo;A cookie, cupcake, piece of cake &amp;mdash; real sweet. It probably started with me having chocolate pop tarts when I was a kid,&amp;rdquo; she says. Growing up in Melbourne Beach, Florida, the young girl never wanted to eat breakfast. &amp;ldquo;My mother would feed me almost anything so I didn&amp;rsquo;t go to school on an empty stomach,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I was a chubby kid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Fox turned 13, she decided she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be heavy anymore so she became very focused on how to have a healthier weight. Several years later, she won a modeling contents (yet to this day she still considers that a fluke).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll always feel a bit like a fish out of water,&amp;rdquo; she says, &amp;ldquo;I felt like one in Florida my whole life. I&amp;rsquo;m quite tall [five-foot-nine] and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trade that for anything, however there&amp;rsquo;s a sort of awkwardness that comes with it. I was never typically what most people think of as attractive or beautiful in Florida &amp;mdash; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t blonde or curvy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While she may still feel atypical at times, Fox can confidently say that she feels a certain comfort in her own skin now. &amp;ldquo;I love the California lifestyle of shorts, sun dresses and surfing so I&amp;rsquo;m on the beach in a bathing suit. Then it&amp;rsquo;s my black wet suit, which reveals all my imperfections. Yeah, I look like a total dork in the water on my surfboard with zinc on my face, and a hat, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather have the fun experience of surfing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN OUTDOOR GIRL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t just surfing Fox loves, she&amp;rsquo;s an outdoor girl. Seizing upon Los Angeles&amp;rsquo; temperate climate, Fox takes her exercise routine to the open air. With her rescue dog Bear by her site, Fox taks 45-minute walks every day &amp;mdash; sometimes longer on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I developed a passion for being outside, so hiking, walking and surfing are year-round activities for me. Growing up in Florida, it was all about the ocean. As a younger person, I surfed for the adrenaline rush. As I&amp;rsquo;m getting older, I&amp;rsquo;m not into that anymore, however I really like the Zen thing of surfing &amp;mdash; clearing my mind and just being in the moment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox also hits the outdoors when she&amp;rsquo;s in Canada. Both of her parents were born in Montreal, Quebec and she still has family scattered throughout the country. &amp;ldquo;One of my brothers is an avid sailor so we go sailing a lot together up north,&amp;rdquo; says Fox, who also loves to swim in the lakes. &amp;ldquo;We also have some skiers in the family so that&amp;rsquo;s always a fun visit in the winter months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FASHION BLUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox says she has a love an appreciation for fashion, however she appreciates it on other people. &amp;ldquo;My parents were of that &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; generation, dressed to the nines every day of their life, loved fashion and they got this little girl who just wanted to be barefoot in shorts and a tank top all the time.&amp;rdquo; If she feels the need to present herself in a certain light, &amp;ldquo;sort of like I&amp;rsquo;m mature, perhaps intellectual. I always go for dark blue, yet I love the blue tropical ocean color within the turquoise family.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUL MUSIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d put my music into a category of guilty indulgence,&amp;rdquo; says Fox. &amp;ldquo;Music is something I have never pursued professionally so it&amp;rsquo;s an art form that I can be as silly and crazy as I want to and never worry about it being popular. That has saved me so many times &amp;mdash; having music, which is just for me or just for me and friends &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think as actors we sometimes forget to have an artistic hobby,&amp;rdquo; says Fox who has played the guitar since age 12. &amp;ldquo;Music is more my story.&amp;rdquo; If she were to write a tune about her life, what would the title be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lady Luck. I know it&amp;rsquo;s been used before, but that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;d title my song.&amp;rdquo; Nor Georgia On My Mind? &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that thousands of time, especially growing up in the South. It&amp;rsquo;s a song I love and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d ever get tired of hearing it.&amp;rdquo; Still, with Fox&amp;rsquo;s success and a peaceful existence, Lady Luck seems more fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HOW DO YOU DEFINE BALANCED LIVING?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JORJA FOX&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIVA COVER GIRL AND STAR OF &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance comes from the inside anbd I think it looks different for different people. What is balance for you and for me might be two different things. At the end of the day, if you are doing something you love, and if you can sleep at night, then that sets up a good equilibrium. An accomplishment and a restful night&amp;rsquo;s sleep help to keep me stable. When I am out of balance, I either can&amp;rsquo;t sleep or I can&amp;rsquo;t get out of bed. To me, that&amp;rsquo;s very telling that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
