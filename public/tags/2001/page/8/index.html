		<p>The increasing presence of motion picture producers and directors in television is turning prime time into an unwatchable mess of PG-13 and even R-style mini-movies. Prominent names such as Joel Silver (The Matrix, Lethal Weapon) and Kevin Williamson (Scream) have already brought their big-screen values to small-screen series. Now add Jerry Bruckheimer (Coyote Ugly, The Rock) to the list. He serves as executive producer for CBS&rsquo; grim CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, the highest-rated new drama of the season and the only new show nominated for a Golden Globe &ldquo;Best Series&rdquo; Award. He also serves up some of television&rsquo;s rawest images.</p>

<p>CSI&rsquo;s stomach-churning shock value was best described by one of its stars, Jorja Fox. &ldquo;I get nauseous just thinking about some of the things I&rsquo;ve seen on the set,&rdquo; she told TV Guide. &ldquo;We recently did an episode in the woods where we come across a murder victim covered with bugs &#8212; real ones. Generally, I&rsquo;m not very squeamish, but there were thousands of them, including the ones you don&rsquo;t normally see, like maggots. It was intense. To be honest, in the beginning, I had to ask myself if I could handle working on this show every day because the content is kinda heavy. It gives you a whole new respect for real-life crime lab experts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, CSI does give viewers an appreciation for those dedicated public servants who sift through police evidence. It has also spoken out against rape, drug abuse, domestic violence, incest and violent crime. But it creates an unintended quandary: Should families entertain themselves by ingesting graphic images of medical autopsies, brutalized bodies, blood-spattered sets and decomposing corpses?</p>

<p>Twenty years ago on Quincy, Jack Klugman described the murders he uncovered each week. CSI shows theirs. From every angle. Over and over again. A drug-crazed raver strangles his friend. A woman caves in a man&rsquo;s skull with a rock. A man shoots himself in the head. A teenager stabs an entire family to death with a kitchen knife. The detectives are fond of saying that blood &ldquo;talks.&rdquo; It also flies, drips, runs and pools on the floor. CSI is ugly, exploitative, gross, disrespectful of the dead and, unfortunately, enormously popular among the living.</p>

		<p>Jorja Fox is on some kind of new career trajectory.</p>

<p>The actress moved from <strong>E.R.</strong>, TV&rsquo;s most popular series, to <strong>The West Wing</strong>, TV&rsquo;s most critically acclaimed. She departed West Wing for <strong>C.S.I.</strong>, the show that has turned out to be this season&rsquo;s highest-rated new drama.</p>

<p>Is it even possible to improve on good fortune like that?</p>

<p>How about CBS moving CSI next week from Friday nights to Thursdays, where it will follow <strong>Survivor: The Australian Outback</strong>, almost guaranteeing it a spot in TV&rsquo;s Top 10.</p>

<p><strong>&#8216;Huge surprise&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;CSI was a huge surprise,&rdquo; says Fox, who was hired last summer well after the show began shooting. Canadian actress <strong>Chandra West</strong>&#8216;s character had been killed off in the second episode, but the producers still wanted the show&rsquo;s forensic investigation team to have a young, female member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to make a decision very quickly and not really knowing if (CSI) would succeed,&rdquo; Fox was recalling recently, on the phone from her home in L.A.</p>

<p>So she took the leap. But not the fall.</p>

<p>The most obvious exit for her West Wing character, the Secret Service agent assigned to the president&rsquo;s daughter, would have been for her to take a bullet in that attempted assassination cliffhanger.</p>

<p>Instead, &ldquo;I walked away without a scratch,&rdquo; Fox says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an Aaron Sorkin trick. I guess typically he doesn&rsquo;t write characters out. So I just kind of disappeared into thin air with The West Wing. That&rsquo;s good because there&rsquo;s a door open for me sometime to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 32-year-old has been on the move much of her life. She was born in New York to Canadian parents &#8212; her late mother was a Francophone, her father an Anglophone &#8212; and she grew up speaking &ldquo;sort of French-lish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever was easiest to say. Growing up, it was very common that one sentence would be French and the next would be English,&rdquo; Fox says.</p>

<p>When she was three, the family moved to Florida. At 15, she won a shopping mall model-search contest and began a New York-based career that lasted through her teen years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel like I had a real natural gift for modelling,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was messy and scruffy and a tomboy, so it wasn&rsquo;t something that came as naturally to me as it did to other kids. But to be 18 in Italy having cappuccinos by the ocean getting your picture taken and getting a cheque was quite nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Breakthrough</strong></p>

<p>Determined to act instead, Fox bartended, waited tables, worked in a kennel, checked coats at a nightclub. Her breakthrough came playing a rookie cop on Missing Persons, a short-lived 1993 TV crime drama starring Daniel J. Travanti. She joined ER as Maggie Doyle in season three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a massive success. It was huge. I was very intimidated by that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I got the job at seven o&rsquo;clock at night and I went to work at seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning. It was good in a way because I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time to think about how scared I was going to be.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>ER fans know Jorja Fox as Dr. Maggie Doyle. West Wingers may remember her as Secret Service agent Gina Toscano, who saved the life of the president (Martin Sheen) last season. Currently, she&rsquo;s co-starring in CBS&rsquo;s surprise hit series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. But even though she&rsquo;s appeared on three of the hottest shows on television, Jorja Fox is not exactly a household name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do like to keep a lower profile,&rdquo; says Fox, 31, who plays forensic investigator Sara Sidel on CSI. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been really fine for me to just sort of take things slowly and stay working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the show, about a team of Las Vegas crime-scene analysts, Fox plays a hard-edged pragmatist who doesn&rsquo;t flinch at the sight of a mutilated corpse. In one episode, for example, Sara takes notes for her boss Gil Grissom (William Petersen) at a bloody crime scene when a police officer becomes too queasy to handle the job. Though her alter ego has a strong stomach, Fox most certainly doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I am the wimp of the cast,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;And I think I was the wimp of the cast over at ER, too.&rdquo; Fox played Dr. Maggie Doyle, whom she fondly refers to as &ldquo;a vegetarian, gun-toting lesbian,&rdquo; on the hospital series from 1996 to 1999. &ldquo;There were several days on ER where I was nauseous for the duration of the scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently, the mood on the set of CSI&rsquo;s morgue is so jovial that Fox doesn&rsquo;t mind the phony blood and guts that much anymore. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s make-believe,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And we have so much fun on the set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; is derived from Fox and her co-stars &#8212; Petersen, Marg Helgenberger, Gary Dourdan and George Eads &#8212; joking about the show&rsquo;s gory special effects. According to Fox, a typical on-set quip would be, &ldquo;Oh my God, look at that great bullet hole!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The morgue looks really nice today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fox also enjoys herself when the cast flies to Vegas from L.A. to do location shots. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a big gambler, but there&rsquo;s something really, really good about being in Las Vegas and having the excuse that you&rsquo;re working to do all kinds of bad things. If you hit the slot machine with a gin and tonic in your hand, you can say, &#8216;Well, I&rsquo;m working.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>

<p>The high-tech crime-solving methods employed by the CSI team on the show are nothing short of fascinating. So far, the team has found forensic clues in toenail clippings, blood, saliva and other icky substances either left at the crime scene or found in the dead victims themselves. In fact, would-be criminals watching the show may be deterred from committing illegal acts when they see how easily they can be caught by today&rsquo;s technology.</p>

<p>But Fox has a flip side to that: Criminals could learn a few things from watching CSI as well, like how not to leave clues behind. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to have a lot of viewers from the prison system,&rdquo; she jokes.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, Fox firmly believes in the ability of science to fight crime: &ldquo;My good friend&rsquo;s mom was murdered, and it was the scientific evidence that was able to conclude without any doubt that the person that they thought murdered her actually did. In fact, he&rsquo;s in jail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the show is high on gore in its depictions of brutal crime scenes, it is low on actual violence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool that we&rsquo;re solving crimes without using guns,&rdquo; says Fox. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m intrinsically antiviolent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, as a crime-scene investigator, Sara does wield a pistol on CSI, as did Gina Toscano on The West Wing. &ldquo;Yeah, and Maggie Doyle was really into guns,&rdquo; adds Fox. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m three-for-three on playing women who carry guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though she seems destined to play strong butt-kicking women on television, it is a fate Fox welcomes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky that I&rsquo;ve been cast to play these really tough women. My God, if I&rsquo;m going to be typecast, it couldn&rsquo;t be better to be this type of chick. I love it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jorja Fox, who plays gung-ho investigator Sara Sidel, said writers are thinking about doing more to develop the characters, but she suspects that will happen slowly, over &ldquo;a long haul.&rdquo; In the meantime, &ldquo;I love being mysterious,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The approach makes for some wonderful scenes. At the end of &ldquo;If These Walls Could Talk,&rdquo; Grissom is leaving the office after finishing the long, gruesome case. On the way out, he grabs an apple from the break room and notices a half-finished crossword puzzle on the table. He stops for a moment, fills in a clue, then heads toward the door. Suddenly, he stops, sits down at the table and digs into the puzzle. The moment tells us more about Grissom&rsquo;s obsessive nature than eight pages of dialogue.</p>

<p>Actor/executive producer William Petersen (Gil Grissom) and executive producer Carol Mendelsohn point out the reasons they brought Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) onto the show.</p>

<h2 id="why-jorja-fox:132eaedf84bf808afaa120711eff5653">Why Jorja Fox?</h2>

<p><strong>William Petersen:</strong> It was very interesting. Here was this young girl who was basically a rookie. And she comes out and we basically ignore her through out the night because we were too busy doing our stuff. And to have her get shot at the end of a pilot was somewhat profound. And then to have her die in the first episode was even more profound. And consequently that&rsquo;s how we got Jorja to come in from San Francisco. Called up Sara Sidle to come in and investigate it. And I think it ended up being- putting right off the bat- a sort of like profundity to something that- you know- to guys collecting evidence. They are in harms way a lot, these guys, which is why they&rsquo;re allowed to wear [guns]. And they&rsquo;re civilians. They&rsquo;re not cops. They work for the police and they&rsquo;re in harms way a lot. And this was one way to show that they were.</p>

<p><strong>Carol Mendelsohn:</strong> And speaking to that question from the perspective of the writers, Anthony and Ann, jump in, it&rsquo;s interesting the response of the audience to that character in the pilot. We created a character that could come in, like the audience, and see everything new and learn along with the CSIs. And in the end, there was an audience reaction that she was not up to the job. That she didn&rsquo;t know enough, and we realized we needed to bring in a young woman that was really smart and knew what she was doing, and was eager and said &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; every time there was a case. And that&rsquo;s Sara Sidle.</p>

<p><strong>Anthony Zuiker:</strong> It was a very gut wrenching to make- to do. It was a very risky decision to make. And it was very unexpected.</p>

<p>##Petersen Et Al On The Science Of The Scripts##</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>William Peteresen:</strong> It&rsquo;s not like dialogue we&rsquo;re used to doing as actors, you know. I mean, it&rsquo;s very complex, scientific stuff. Half the time, we don&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;re saying. We don&rsquo;t even know how to pronounce the words. But I&rsquo;ll tell you, it&rsquo;s fascinating, keeps you - I mean, Jorja, we had that whole thing with the last one.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Carol Mendelsohn:</strong> Once in a while an actor will call from the set because they don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce a word, or they ask where a certain body part is. And we pretend that we actually know. [&hellip;] We have a - One of our co-producers, Josh Berman, his father is a doctor and occasionally with Latin phrases, Josh gets on the phone with his father while I&rsquo;m on the phone with the set.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> I&rsquo;ve called with French words before.</p>
