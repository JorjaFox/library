		<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Ah, my character&rsquo;s name is Sara Sidle, and she&rsquo;s come in from San Francisco, ah, the character of Grissom has called her up and said there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a major problem happening down in Vegas, would you come down and help out for a while. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve sort of just come off an airplane and like everybody else I haven&rsquo;t slept in like two days, came right in. So that idea is that, ah, I&rsquo;ll just sort of see if I can help out getting to the bottom of this disaster and then go on home to San Francisco.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I&rsquo;m a CSI 2 and I&rsquo;m a forensic scientist who also does some investigative work. So I think that science is my specialty, but I&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of investigating.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> A lot of people attracted to the show will be puzzle solvers and will be very interested in getting to the, the truth of the matter and getting to the depth of the matter, so&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I can only say that my biggest concern about being so excited to do the show was the day to day of being in the gore and how I deal with that, you know, like &#8216;would that be fun&rsquo; or would that be like I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure and&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s going to be&hellip; okay, you know, I still know like if there&rsquo;s something particularly disturbing I probably will skip lunch until we shoot it, finish it.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> I have so much respect and admiration, actually, for the folks who do this, you know, who can, who can show up every day and kind of try and figure out what has happened.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> Sara Sidle is not squeamish. I think she&rsquo;s, you know, she&rsquo;s very cerebral, and she really, she lives for what she does, and I think, uh, she, she can become emotionally affected by what she&rsquo;s experiencing, but it doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of her ability to, to be there and be present in it.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> The intent is not to be gratuitous, you know, but at the same time, ah, because the show is so visual, and, and we can go places with that. There&rsquo;s moments like, you know, we can show this pulsing heart, we have the technology, you know, so you want to have that opportunity if you can.</p>

		<p>The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn is a TV Talk show/variety show, hosted by Craig Kilborn. Jorja Fox was the second guest, and introduced as a &ldquo;beautiful actress &hellip; helming the hit TV series CSI&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Craig Kilborn:</strong> Welcome back, our next guest is a beautiful actress who has helped make CBS series &ldquo;CSI.&rdquo; the highest rated new drama on television. Please welcome Jorja Fox. &ldquo;(cheers and applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I&rsquo;m doing great.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> you look great, I like the bright colors the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Trying to look alive.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You did &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;, &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; everything you touch turns to gold, right?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Ah, well. No.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Just about.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Can I touch you? I had a really, really great couple of years. &ldquo;(laughter)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Tell them where you filmed &ldquo;C.S.I.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We shoot in the glamorous city of Valencia, California and occasionally we go to Las Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You spend a lot of the time in Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Where do they put you up?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We have a choice. We have condos or a couple of hotels.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> What do you choose?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> The fancy hotels as much as possibly.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Do you gamble?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I might a little bit. The great thing about going to work is you have the excuse you can only do in Vegas because you&rsquo;re working so I have to go to the slot machine. You get a free drink.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They bring the drinks around all the time. There free hoping that you&rsquo;ll gamble all night. You&rsquo;ll catch that little buzz. I think you can say buzz on TV.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Is that why they bring the drinks?</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They don&rsquo;t have a clock so you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s 6:00 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There&rsquo;s oxygen everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There&rsquo;s oxygen and the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t know they brought you free drinks so that they keep you gambling.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> I&rsquo;m just guessing. Why do you think because you&rsquo;re a pretty girl they bring you free drinks?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I love Vegas.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Speaking of being a pretty girl, years ago you use to hang out in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yeah, how did you know about that?</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Because they told me years ago you were the modeling type. You use to model in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I was an imposter model in Italy when I was a teenager. Yes, for a short period of time.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How did you find Italy? Did you like it?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I loved Italy. It&rsquo;s an amazing, beautiful, incredible, everything is beautiful in it.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Right, its beautiful. The men are-</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> The dogs are beautiful, yeah the man are pretty beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> The men are very aggressive but I heard the food is amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, Can you tell? I&rsquo;m just back from Italy actually. I weigh seven pounds heavier than when I left, which is great, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for anything.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You&rsquo;re bulked up. Look at that. whoa! Surprised you fit that skirt there.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> You have to wear baggy clothes that&rsquo;s the trick.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> So you went years ago and meet some gentlemen when you were there.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;(stammering)&rdquo; Ah, Ah, Maybe! Yeah, one or two guys, I mean I was there for along time it wasn&rsquo;t like I was there for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> And were they romantic? How were they?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Oh yeah, everything&rsquo;s romance, passion and beauty and-</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> What was it? What would they do? What were some of the things?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well, they would take me to a bar.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Oooh. There, right.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We&rsquo;d have some peanuts and you know it&rsquo;s great, very high class.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You went recently. You just got back from a trip.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> I went vacation this year. I was in Italy for two weeks with two days in Croatia and a day in Greece.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Did you meet any interesting people? Did you go by yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, I went with my friend Suzanne [Mara]. The two of us went together.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There you have it, right there, that&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> And we meet no one. No I did, I met an old lady on the train. &ldquo;(laughter)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> There, there, there, that&rsquo;s her!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> There she is and her dog. &ldquo;(applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How did that go?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We didn&rsquo;t know what to say because my Italian is fairly limited. Just Caio.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> You do a lot of this then? A lot of Petting? &ldquo;(hand movements)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, the funny thing is you don&rsquo;t know the language so you start using your hands all the time for everything which is embarrassing. Talk loud and do things like this thinking people will know what your saying. &ldquo;(more hand movements)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Why would she talk to you then. If you couldn&rsquo;t talk? Why would she spend so much time with you?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> We didn&rsquo;t talk that long actually. I would have talked longer with her but-</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> So when you say you meet her, you just took her picture to show people, so that in case you went on a talk show, to prove that you went to Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Actually I internetted that. I was home late last night and pulled it off.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> They also tell me, this is interesting. What did you do this weekend? I didn&rsquo;t get the story, they said just ask her about it.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> My friend John and I decided to walk the mountaintops from town, from Hollywood, all the way to the ocean. We heard it could be done.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> This is from the mountaintops up in the Hollywood hills?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Yes, So if you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles you would start at the top of Runyun and then go to the Tree People, there&rsquo;s sort of all these trails that connect but they don&rsquo;t really connect all the way. So that&rsquo;s Hitch #1.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> How do you get across the 405?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> &ldquo;(laughing)&rdquo; That was Hitch #2. Then we thought we&rsquo;ll just walk Mulholland, we could do that, then we decided not to do that because we&rsquo;re gonna do this big hike and it would be a way, basically we were going to do a 13 mile hike on Friday and we did 7 miles &ldquo;(looks embarrassed)&rdquo;. It was 97 degrees on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> It was very hot. How many hours was it then?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Uh. 4 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> 4 hours of walking.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> So the 13 miles, we could have done in 8 hours but the Gatorade ran out, the water ran out.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> But it was an adventure and you went for it and it was a waste of time.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Well yeah, I&rsquo;m into wildlife. I like to see wildlife which is one of the reason I&rsquo;m here tonight. &ldquo;(laughter, cheering, applause)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Finally, finally at the end she got me. I was waiting for that.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> And I&rsquo;m bad at it too.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Yeah, I know. Did I give you that line?</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> No, no, backstage they gave it to me, they gave me this card.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Ok, we&rsquo;re out of time surprisingly. Good luck with C.S.I. It&rsquo;s a huge, huge show.</p>

<p><strong>Jorja:</strong> Thank you. We had a good year, a really good year and we will be back. More dead people.</p>

<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Lets hear it for Jorja Fox!</p>

		<p><strong>I never got off the bus</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who are your heroes?</strong></p>

<p>I actually have a lot. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., John Lennon, Oprah Winfrey, Geronimo, Harvey Milk, Maya Angelou, Einstein. All share courage, independent thinking, immense creativity and a passion/compulsion for freedom and equality for all people. Geronimo, the only non-pacifist in the group, never gave up, faced unbeatable odds and persevered with ingenious strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a book or movie that has changed your life?</strong></p>

<p>Playboy magazine. No comment [as to why]. &ldquo;Catcher In The Rye,&rdquo; by J.D. Salinger. No list would be complete without it. I think that book has changed almost everyone&rsquo;s life who&rsquo;s read it. &ldquo;1984&rdquo; by George Orwell speaks volumes on anything political that&rsquo;s happened in the last 50 years in my jaded, Generation X opinion.</p>

<p><strong>What was your worst day ever?</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ve had it already. What comes to mind is this day in kindergarten when we had a substitute bus driver, who didn&rsquo;t know the route. I rode the bus for maybe six hours.</p>

<p><strong>What would you be doing if you weren&rsquo;t doing this?</strong></p>

<p>Produce. Write. I would&rsquo;ve loved to have been a marine biologist, but I don&rsquo;t quite get science and math in general.</p>

<p><strong>Online extra: Q&amp;A with actress Jorja Fox of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox, &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; forensics investigator Sara Sidle, has a knack for landing in the hot show of the moment. Her face is familiar to viewers of both &ldquo;ER&rdquo; and &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;, on which she had recurring parts as a doctor and secret service agent respectively. Patty Rhule caught up with her on the final week of filming &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, the CBS hit with a remarkable debut season.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: Did the bloody scenes on &ldquo;ER&rdquo; prepare you for what was ahead on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the wimp of the cast and I am a little squeamish. Just when I think it&rsquo;s going away, it&rsquo;s not. When I met (star and producer) Billy Petersen and the creator (Anthony Zuiker) for lunch, I sit down and order this delicious lunch and they immediately start talking about heads in popcorn containers. I was turning green. But I thought, if I act too wimpy, they might have second thoughts about me. We just did an episode (where) we find a skinned torso in the desert. Just when I thought I was over it the special effects guy kept pouring fresh blood over it so it was nice and shiny.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do you handle that? Eat a dry cracker?</strong></p>

<p>I just breathe through it. I wait and eat after the scene is over.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You have been in &ldquo;ER&rdquo;, &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;, and now &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; and the cool movie, &ldquo;Memento&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s your secret?</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, I feel unspeakably lucky. I just sort of fell into these things. With West Wing and &ldquo;ER&rdquo; I knew they were runaway hits. &ldquo;ER&rdquo; I came to in episode 3 &#8212; it was sort of terrifying. But nothing really compares with the excitement of &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;. We shoot in the country outside L.A. You have faith in something and hope it&rsquo;s going to do well. To watch this year unfold, I don&rsquo;t really have words for it. I&rsquo;ve been crying for the past couple of days, because it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s going to be an excellent year. I only worked on &ldquo;Memento&rdquo; for a couple of days (as the dead wife). I get to be that sort of objective person, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not in it very much.</p>

<p>**Q: Are you getting more movie work over hiatus? **</p>

<p>Not really movie roles. Schedule-wise, there wasn&rsquo;t a tremendous amount of time. I kind of made a decision to rest and relax. A close friend is doing a short film: it&rsquo;s four or five days (work).</p>

<p><strong>Q: You&rsquo;ve hinted that there is more to be revealed about your &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; character.</strong></p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be like snapshots, they will very slowly reveal things about all of us and the hope is people will always want to know more about us. Nothing too specific, but she&rsquo;s got a skeleton or two in her closet. We&rsquo;re having a meeting with writers &hellip; to hash out all kinds of ideas for next year. That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really special about the show. It really is very collaborative.</p>

<p><strong>Q: So you&rsquo;ll do your friend&rsquo;s film over break?</strong></p>

<p>A short film. I have a little theater company with some friends and this is our first foray into film; we&rsquo;re shooting on 35 mm. I&rsquo;ve written some plays and produced one or two.</p>

<p>**Q: How much time do you have off? **</p>

<p>About two months. There&rsquo;ll be a couple of big publicity things in early July. In the next couple of weeks, I&rsquo;m not that good for anybody. It&rsquo;s the happiest tired in the world, but it&rsquo;s almost a little useless.</p>

<p>**Q: Do you have travel plans? **</p>

<p>I have huge big travel dreams, haven&rsquo;t decided on a place yet. I&rsquo;m going to New York, where I&rsquo;m from, going to do a little bit of charity work for the ASPCA. They&rsquo;re a really good organization. I know it&rsquo;s involving water. It could be the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe, it could be anywhere. I look at the pictures every day.</p>

<p><strong>Q: You&rsquo;re a fan of the ASPCA. Do you have pets?</strong></p>

<p>I have a dog and two cats. My dog comes to the set with me sometimes. If I&rsquo;m in one scene in a day, she has a great time. George Eads brings his dog every day. That&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s nice about shooting out of town. When we&rsquo;re in L.A., we&rsquo;re in the Valencia area, 45 minutes north. (Other times) we go to Vegas. I love Vegas. It&rsquo;s very special to be there, it&rsquo;s such a specific city, a beautiful, moody, dark place, it&rsquo;s so good for us when we&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;s very helpful. The only bad thing about Vegas is that it doesn&rsquo;t close. And I&rsquo;m a terrible gambler. And it&rsquo;s very difficult not to gamble when you&rsquo;re there.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where did you get the unusual name?</strong></p>

<p>My parents are from Montr&eacute;al. (It&rsquo;s common in French) the j was a twist on it. I&rsquo;m a child of the &lsquo;70s. It&rsquo;s my given name &hellip; until I was about 10 everybody tried to tell me how to spell it.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you a computer user?</strong></p>

<p>No one has a DSL line at work. We get in there (to the office computer) and just about when you&rsquo;re really comfortable, they come in to do some work-related thing. I&rsquo;m a pretty big computer person, but it&rsquo;s suffered alot already.</p>

<p>**Q: Have you seen the fan websites? **</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see them that often. I was really flattered and amazed.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are you a married person, a single person?</strong></p>

<p>Involved, but not married. I&rsquo;m not allowed to talk about it at all. I&rsquo;ve been sworn to secrecy &#8212; the whole theory that it&rsquo;s more special. I&rsquo;m very happy and living under a shroud until further notice.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m one of the many fans of CBS&rsquo; hit crime drama, &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;. Tell me about Jorja Fox, one of the forensic investigators.<br />
Roseanne Turner, Denver, Ind.</p>

<p>She has a talent for being in the show of the moment: Fox, 32, was in ER early on, The West Wing last year and now CSI, plus the acclaimed indie movie &ldquo;Memento&rdquo;. The New York native is unmarried but &ldquo;involved, and not allowed to talk about it. I&rsquo;ve been sworn to secrecy!&rdquo; She can talk about her love of animals (she has a dog and two cats); she headed back to New York on her break from CSI to work with the ASPCA. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the wimp of the cast, a little squeamish,&rdquo; she says when asked about her gruesome scenes. &ldquo;When I met [co-star] Billy [Petersen] and the creator [Anthony Zuiker] for lunch, I order this delicious lunch and they start talking about heads in popcorn containers.&rdquo;</p>
