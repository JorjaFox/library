      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re back this season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe. Maybe I am, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the first episode, and you were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely there for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; And a couple more there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m visiting for a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;ll be in and out, so that&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. I knew that might happen, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was gonna happen so soon. But, uh, so it was a surprise. It&amp;rsquo;s always a surprise, really. And it&amp;rsquo;s been really great, it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Now Grissom/Sara might &amp;hellip; ride off into the sunset together? In his final episode?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Well. I guess there&amp;rsquo;s kind of two options, right? Either they end up together or they don&amp;rsquo;t. So &amp;#8212; and I don&amp;rsquo;t know either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;rsquo;t know yet!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no I don&amp;rsquo;t. I haven&amp;rsquo;t started that episode yet. And I really believe it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those shows that, until it&amp;rsquo;s all shot, anything could happen. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be surprised &amp;#8212; We almost &amp;#8212; We never do more than one ending, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if we did on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; What was it like coming back? Like after being away for a year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh. In some ways if felt like I had been gone just for the weekend. Like I had never left. Strangely so normal. And then, on the other hand, it was just crazy. Cause I had had this big, dramatic, goodbye, and the hugs and the cake and &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; and you know, a couple months pass and there I was. It felt, sort of, really very dramatic about my exit. Not knowing, you know what I mean, three months would pass and I&amp;rsquo;d be all &amp;ldquo;Hey, hi, everyone! Yeah, here I am.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you going to do after you wrap your &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; run?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know, you know what I mean? There&amp;rsquo;s a few options and I&amp;rsquo;m looking at some TV stuff now, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at some feature stuff. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;ve been goofing off. You probably know that. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having &amp;#8212; I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s a mid-life crisis or what, but &amp;hellip; some remote beach, or I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Alaska this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve had jet engines for legs, which, really, I feel blessed and so fortunate. So now I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get the itch to work, so. Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at a few different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Do people ever come up to you and say &amp;ldquo;God, you left the number one series on TV, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that happens. And I actually agree with them, sort of, half the time. Me, you know it was my twelfth season in a row, and everybody else on the show it was their eighth or ninth. And I just &amp;#8212; I needed a break. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had this part of my life mapped out at all. I kind of felt like I needed to take some air and figure out what I want that to look like. You know, do I want to stay in TV, if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to do so? Do I want to go get a degree in, like, economics? What do- I- It&amp;rsquo;s uncharted territory for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you think &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten more Emmy love, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t get it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s so nice of you to say. You know, I feel like I was lucky enough to be on &amp;ldquo;[[ER]]&amp;rdquo; for three years, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of Emmy love either. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that we&amp;rsquo;ve the honor of being the most popular and so, the world sort of spreads these honors around, those gifts around. So we get to be that, we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;still&amp;rdquo; number one. We rarely brag, but it&amp;rsquo;s like, how&amp;rsquo;s that even possible? We&amp;rsquo;re still number one? But we are. So maybe that&amp;rsquo;s enough and we should be really happy. I would have loved to see Billy get nominated this year, I feel he really deserves it. After nine solid years of being the heart and soul of that show. If anybody should take one home, I think he should.&lt;/p&gt;
