&lt;h2 id=&#34;animals-in-entertainment:d6d0d44f5b3165ea450d22e8faf52cca&#34;&gt;Animals in entertainment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox joined ADI when they went to Austin, Texas to look into the issue of circus animal cruelty in Austin. Meeting with City Hall, Jorja Fox presented the Council with scientific evidence and video proof of the mistreatment of animals in the circus. Accepting a letter, report and DVD from Jorja Fox, on behalf of the campaigning group, the City Council agreed to research and consider a ban on animal circuses in light of the evidence presented by ADIs report and undercover footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bolivian-lion-rescue:d6d0d44f5b3165ea450d22e8faf52cca&#34;&gt;Bolivian Lion Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 2010, Jorja took part in the ADI rescue of former circus lions from Bolivia. Working with ADI San Francisco, Jorja assisted with the media releases, as well as being on hand when the lions were brought to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a text only reprint of an ad done by Jorja Fox for Climate Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro:32df1f9494ef47a63b2f61abd1407a8b&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hottest stars in the entertainment universe are concerned about something serious that&amp;rsquo;s happening to our planet &amp;ndash; global warming. The following is from the advert Jorja Fox was in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ad:32df1f9494ef47a63b2f61abd1407a8b&#34;&gt;Ad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stranded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a new reality show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s what thousands of species now face thanks to global warming. Habitats are changing along with the climate, and many species will disappear from their present homes while others may disappear altogether. We can slow global warming down if we take action now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global warming isn&amp;rsquo;t cool. Stopping it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earth Shoes</title>
      <link>http://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/earth-shoes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earth shoes are extremely comfortable shoes, made in a &amp;#8216;negative heel&amp;rsquo; design that is reported to alleviate stress on the lower back and improve posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Negative Heel technology was developed by Danish Yoga Master, Anne Kalso. This design positions the heel slightly lower than the toe to promote a more natural posture with the head straight, shoulders rolled back and spine and pelvis aligned, allowing the back to form its natural arch. Though some may find the shoes to strain their Achilles tendon, it will encourage flexibility (which is a good thing). The downside is that some calf conditioning will be lost. The best results may be found by alternating between &amp;lsquo;higher heel&amp;rsquo; shoes and the &amp;lsquo;negative heel&amp;rsquo; ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth company has expanded their product line to a series of Vegan shoes for men and women. Jorja Fox, among other stars, support the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In Defense of Animals&amp;rdquo; (IDA)&amp;rsquo;s mission is to end animal exploitation, cruelty, and abuse by protecting and advocating for the rights, welfare, and habitats of animals, as well as to raise their status beyond mere property, commodities, or things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;international-day-of-action-for-elephants-in-zoos-idaez:2ed1aefe37a6eaf54a75bdc5abc9b030&#34;&gt;International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos (IDAEZ)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 19th 2010 was a global event aimed at bringing mammoth attention to the plight of elephants in zoos and ending their suffering. Jorja was a supporter and said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, Jorja Fox here asking you to support this year&amp;rsquo;s International Day of Action for Elephants in Zoos. These magnificent, magical creatures are some of the world&amp;rsquo;s smartest and also one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most endangered animals. Yet they have long suffered from manâs brutality, including in zoos. Let&amp;rsquo;s evolve beyond zoos. They are arcane, cruel and a tragic waste of an elephant&amp;rsquo;s life. We need to put the focus where it belongs &amp;ndash; on protecting elephants in their natural habitats &amp;ndash; and stop wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on artificial and inadequate zoo displays that will never meet their needs. Instead of cruel confinement and domination, let&amp;rsquo;s offer sanctuary, peace, compassion and hope. The elephants are depending on us, our children our looking to us, and our very own survival as a species depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Racing Extinction</title>
      <link>http://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/racing-extinction/</link>

      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/racing-extinction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Racing Extinction, a team of artists and activists exposes the hidden world of extinction with never-before-seen images that will change the way we see the planet. Two worlds drive extinction across the globe, potentially resulting in the loss of half of all species. The international wildlife trade creates bogus markets at the expense of creatures that have survived on this planet for millions of years. And the other surrounds us, hiding in plain sight — a world that the oil and gas companies don’t want the rest of us to see. Using covert tactics and state-of-the-art technology, the Racing Extinction team exposes these two worlds in an inspiring affirmation to preserve life as we know it. From the Academy Award® Winning Filmmakers of &amp;ldquo;The Cove&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja hosted the premiere of the movie, and has been a vocal advocate for it since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formed when Captain Paul Watson founded the Earth Force Society in 1977 in Vancouver BC, Canada. The original mandate of both organizations was marine mammal protection and conservation with an immediate goal of shutting down illegal whaling and sealing operations, but Sea Shepherd later expanded its mission to include all marine wildlife. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society was formally incorporated in the United States in 1981 in the state of Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
