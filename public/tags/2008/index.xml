      <description>&lt;p&gt;The City Council temporarily halted construction of a new $42 million elephant exhibit at the Los Angeles Zoo on Wednesday amid concerns over funding and a debate over whether the animals should be kept in zoos at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vote came after the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association offered to pay an additional $14 million to finish the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the council meeting, activists and celebrities including comedian Lily Tomlin and actress Jorja Fox said the zoo&amp;rsquo;s costly exhibit would do nothing to alleviate painful foot diseases that often lead to death among captive elephants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They argued that the zoo should hand over its lone elephant, 22-year-old Billy, to an animal sanctuary in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obama campaign is going to do wonders for the gang running Artists &amp;amp; Athletes, the nonprofit that has found its niche within the confines of Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s interest in and naivetÃ© about Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night the ballroom at the Four Seasons in L.A. was filled with 140 agents, publicists, managers, writers, producers, directors and actors who filed in to listen to Mark Halperin moderate a panel discussion about what to expect from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panelists such as CNN/radio personality Roland Martin and GOP media strategist Fred Davis showed off their know-how and answered questions from the audience, including A&amp;amp;A co-chairmen Jason Alexander and Kelsey Grammer, along with Jorja Fox (&amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;); Isaiah Washington, KaDee Strickland (&amp;ldquo;Private Practice&amp;rdquo;), Tom &amp;ldquo;Owner of the BoSox&amp;rdquo; Warner, Robert Knepper (&amp;ldquo;Prison Break&amp;rdquo;), Robbie Jones (&amp;ldquo;One Tree Hill&amp;rdquo;), Francis Fisher (the mom from &amp;ldquo;Titanic&amp;rdquo;), Scott Wolfe, Alicia Witt and Joel McHale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is that? Pseudo-celebrities wanting to learn about politics all in the same room and Terry McAuliffe is no where to be found?? Boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumor has it Halperin was so popular people kept asking questions 40 minutes after it all had concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a new group in town, and Hollywood is excited to learn about it,&amp;rdquo; says a happy Steve Ross, A&amp;amp;A&amp;rsquo;s executive director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some [&lt;a href=&#34;http://web.beimages.net/link/11thltsllnc13/&#34;&gt;http://web.beimages.net/link/11thltsllnc13/&lt;/a&gt; images] from the event. (Oh look is Scott Wolfe and his &amp;ldquo;Real World&amp;rdquo; wife!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On yesterday&amp;rsquo;s episode of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Leave Out All the Rest&amp;rdquo;), recently departed CSI Sara Sidle sends Gil Grissom a .mov file -slash- Dear John &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo; over the internets. Look closely, and you can briefly see her email address flash across the screen: info@seashepherd.org. ZOMG! Sara is sailing with the crew of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seashepherd.org/&#34;&gt;Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of her adventure with Captain Paul Watson and his band of anti-whaling pirates, Sara says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello from below the equator, in Puerto Ayora. We’ve been at sea for over a month now. Man, you wouldn’t believe the crew - students, activists, scientists - the dinner conversations alone are mindblowing. And there’s even this marine biologist that reminds me a little bit of you. I wish that we could talk in person but this is the best that I can do. I want to apologize for being out of touch. I’ve been thinking about us a lot, though, all the moments. I thought we could survive anything. This trip has given me a lot of clarity. That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone think but now, for the first time in a really long time, I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When actress Jorja Fox - the vegetarian and PETA supporter who plays Sara Sidle - left &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; last season, I was afraid it would be the end of &amp;ldquo;CSI**s animal-friendly plotlines. In the past, they&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with canned hunting involving discarded zoo animals, dog fighting, factory farming and chicken slaughter, and Sara&amp;rsquo;s vegetarianism, of course. The show has been honored by the HSUS&amp;rsquo;s Genesis Awards for its compassionate storylines; in a multi-episode plotline, Danny Bonaduce played an aging rock star/animal welfare crusader, who targeted said slaughterhouse in a PETA-like PSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Jorja Fox is the high-profile veg*n on &amp;ldquo;CSI**s set, I assumed that she was the driving force behind these stories. I wonder whether she managed to convert any of her co-workers, or if one/some of the writers also just happen to be interested in animal advocacy on their own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I think it&amp;rsquo;s totally awesome that Sara Sidle has defected - from Crime Scene Investigator to international, sea-faring, anti-whaling, activist-pirate-terrorist. Welcome to the dark green side, Sara. Just be careful who you extend your vegan potluck invites to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up with Sara and the crew through &lt;a href=&#34;http://animal.discovery.com/tv/whale-wars/&#34;&gt;Whale Wars&lt;/a&gt;, now airing on Animal Planet (Fridays at 9PM).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: Have we really seen the last of Sara Sidle on &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;? Last week&amp;rsquo;s ending of Episode 2 was heartbreaking. The creators have invested years hinting at, building up and finally revealing the relationship between Gil and Sara. I appreciate that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been all hearts and flowers, but now that Petersen is leaving the show anyway, why not let these two tortured characters have a happy ending together? â Patrice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Roush:&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s still a way to go before Grissom takes his final bow, and it&amp;rsquo;s not in my nature to spoil any details of his final chapters even if I could. But an editor here who oversees &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; was told before the season began that Jorja Fox was set to appear in three episodes, so given that she walked away (rather powerfully, I thought) at the end of the second, there&amp;rsquo;s a probability she&amp;rsquo;ll be back at least once more before Gil&amp;rsquo;s story is fully told. Whatever happens, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine his and her fate will be left rather open-ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/news/2008/the-courier-mail/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I WAS shocked at the amount of wrinkle-relaxing poison in the face of Jorja Fox when I watched CSI last week. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any. She just looked like the rest of us, ie: a corrugated iron roof from some angles.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was back for Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, an episode that required some emotion to register on his colleagues&amp;rsquo; face. So it worked out well for her. Not so good for the other woman in the show, Marg Helgenberger, who didn&amp;rsquo;t look remotely upset, even though she said she was. It was like watching a surfboard trying to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much more we&amp;rsquo;re going to see of Jorja and her character Sara and I don&amp;rsquo;t care, I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself watching CSI again now until the new Grissom Laurence Fishburne starts. Although Sara did deliver one of the more convincing, authentic-sounding lines I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard on CSI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was when she and that other cop went to Warrick&amp;rsquo;s house to get him an outfit to wear in his coffin and his bed wasn&amp;rsquo;t made and she said how she&amp;rsquo;d been to so many murder scenes, she would never leave her house in the morning until she&amp;rsquo;d made her bed and taken the rubbish out, in case she never came home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could actually imagine homicide police or whatever saying something like that, if not physically doing it. Female cops especially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was certainly more realistic than George Eads&amp;rsquo;s theory about the wet towel &amp;hellip; it was towards the end, and they&amp;rsquo;re gearing up for the big chase after the dodgy cop-killing cop, and George â Nick in the show â swans in to the empty hotel room and spying a towel screwed up on the bed, picks it up, finds it&amp;rsquo;s still damp, and announces they&amp;rsquo;ve just missed him. He&amp;rsquo;s obviously never arrived home at the end of the day to find a mass of towel somewhere strange, still wet 10 hours after it&amp;rsquo;s been used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara would never have said that line. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why she&amp;rsquo;s no longer on the show. Although from those ads last week she must be in at least one more episode â it looked like she and Grissom were doing some naked post-something cuddling from where I was sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jorjafox.net/library/news/2008/ew-04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;] I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised to learn that so many of you got choked up at the gut-wrenching scenes from Warrick&amp;rsquo;s funeral, but I was taken aback by some commentary regarding Sara&amp;rsquo;s appearance &amp;ndash; namely, whether or not she was with child, and if her condition would eventually explain her abrupt decision to leave Las Vegas last season. All I can say is &amp;ndash; good God, no. Look, I hated her poofy dress (and the curls she wore with it) probably as much as the next fan, but never in my wildest dreams would I have considered she was trying to cover up a secret pregnancy. That&amp;rsquo;s why I was relieved to learn from a CSI insider that no such treacly twist is in the cards for Sara &amp;ndash; who, based on last night&amp;rsquo;s episode, has once again abandoned her beloved for destinations unknown (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those cases paled in comparison to a third story involving a man named Tom Adler, who unplugged his comatose wife. It&amp;rsquo;s this sad case of euthanasia (and, if you really think about it, the confession from that murderous teenager) that seemed to offer some insight into where Gil and Sara are headed. First, we have the teenage boy who exclaimed that his cougar lover &amp;ldquo;promised me everything and took it all away!&amp;rdquo; (Hmm, might that also be another way of demonstrating that Sara promised Gil a lifetime of happiness before she took it all away by leaving town?) And then, we were treated to this eye-opening exchange between Gil and Sara as they sparred over Tom&amp;rsquo;s decision to kill his vegetable spouse. Gil: &amp;ldquo;Sooner or later a relationship&amp;hellip;withers. You get angry. Sometimes, you need more than the safety of knowing that you are not alone.&amp;rdquo; Sara: &amp;ldquo;Then he should have just walked away.&amp;rdquo; Gil: &amp;ldquo;Maybe he couldn&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe he needed her to leave him.&amp;rdquo; Sara (first pausing for dramatic effect): &amp;ldquo;Who are we talking about right now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I never got the response I craved; Sara packed her bags and hit the road again, with no clue as to when she&amp;rsquo;ll be back. The possibilities are limitless, like this clever (if idealistic) suggestion from poster Cathy Tockstein: &amp;ldquo;When Gil and Sara leave Las Vegas, do you think they will try to get custody of Warrick&amp;rsquo;s son to raise him as their own child?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s assuming she and Gil reunite at all. Personally, my guess is that Sara finally figured out that her boyfriend was an emotional deadbeat (Daddy smacked him silly during his already troubled youth!) and she finally gave up on their maddening backroom romance. But hell, I could just be reaching. [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re back this season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe. Maybe I am, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen the first episode, and you were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely there for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; And a couple more there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m visiting for a little bit. I&amp;rsquo;ll be in and out, so that&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. I knew that might happen, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was gonna happen so soon. But, uh, so it was a surprise. It&amp;rsquo;s always a surprise, really. And it&amp;rsquo;s been really great, it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Now Grissom/Sara might &amp;hellip; ride off into the sunset together? In his final episode?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Well. I guess there&amp;rsquo;s kind of two options, right? Either they end up together or they don&amp;rsquo;t. So &amp;#8212; and I don&amp;rsquo;t know either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;rsquo;t know yet!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; No, no I don&amp;rsquo;t. I haven&amp;rsquo;t started that episode yet. And I really believe it&amp;rsquo;s going to be one of those shows that, until it&amp;rsquo;s all shot, anything could happen. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be surprised &amp;#8212; We almost &amp;#8212; We never do more than one ending, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if we did on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; What was it like coming back? Like after being away for a year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh. In some ways if felt like I had been gone just for the weekend. Like I had never left. Strangely so normal. And then, on the other hand, it was just crazy. Cause I had had this big, dramatic, goodbye, and the hugs and the cake and &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo; and you know, a couple months pass and there I was. It felt, sort of, really very dramatic about my exit. Not knowing, you know what I mean, three months would pass and I&amp;rsquo;d be all &amp;ldquo;Hey, hi, everyone! Yeah, here I am.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you going to do after you wrap your &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; run?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know, you know what I mean? There&amp;rsquo;s a few options and I&amp;rsquo;m looking at some TV stuff now, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at some feature stuff. Mostly I&amp;rsquo;ve been goofing off. You probably know that. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having &amp;#8212; I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s a mid-life crisis or what, but &amp;hellip; some remote beach, or I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Alaska this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve had jet engines for legs, which, really, I feel blessed and so fortunate. So now I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get the itch to work, so. Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at a few different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Do people ever come up to you and say &amp;ldquo;God, you left the number one series on TV, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with you?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that happens. And I actually agree with them, sort of, half the time. Me, you know it was my twelfth season in a row, and everybody else on the show it was their eighth or ninth. And I just &amp;#8212; I needed a break. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had this part of my life mapped out at all. I kind of felt like I needed to take some air and figure out what I want that to look like. You know, do I want to stay in TV, if I&amp;rsquo;m lucky enough to do so? Do I want to go get a degree in, like, economics? What do- I- It&amp;rsquo;s uncharted territory for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you think &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten more Emmy love, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t get it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s so nice of you to say. You know, I feel like I was lucky enough to be on &amp;ldquo;[[ER]]&amp;rdquo; for three years, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of Emmy love either. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that we&amp;rsquo;ve the honor of being the most popular and so, the world sort of spreads these honors around, those gifts around. So we get to be that, we&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;still&amp;rdquo; number one. We rarely brag, but it&amp;rsquo;s like, how&amp;rsquo;s that even possible? We&amp;rsquo;re still number one? But we are. So maybe that&amp;rsquo;s enough and we should be really happy. I would have loved to see Billy get nominated this year, I feel he really deserves it. After nine solid years of being the heart and soul of that show. If anybody should take one home, I think he should.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Jorja Fox:** I think it&amp;rsquo;s my second or my third year at this party. I&amp;rsquo;m not the biggest party person. Yeah, no it&amp;rsquo;s super fun, it&amp;rsquo;s been super fun. I&amp;rsquo;ve even had a friend come in from out of town and she&amp;rsquo;s so excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it&amp;rsquo;s a convergence of a lot of different people who almost never get to see each other. That&amp;rsquo;s number one. And because so many people are coming out tomorrow night anywhere, they&amp;rsquo;re here, they&amp;rsquo;re getting ready, they&amp;rsquo;re excited, they&amp;rsquo;re adrenaline is high. So almost everybody comes out tonight. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how dressed up everybody gets. For me, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to the Emmys tomorrow, CSI&amp;rsquo;s not nominated. So it&amp;rsquo;s great for me to get dressed up. If I was going to the Emmys tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;d probably be here in flip flops and jeans, just cause it&amp;rsquo;s a lot! It&amp;rsquo;s like a fourteen hour day! But people really worked it out, people look great today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the work part! I know that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe it, that this is part of the job. But if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky. Once you get inside, it&amp;rsquo;s not too work-y. It&amp;rsquo;s really kind of social. And especially there are a lot of New Yorkers who are never here, that are here, and a couple Canadians, and the documentary people that are always wherever in Swazziland. It&amp;rsquo;s cool to get to kind of hang out and celebrate your work. That you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to be here and doing what you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question: So, you are one of the lucky privileged people who got to see the premiere of &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; early. What is the deal with Grissom-Sara? All of these interviews and articles make it sound like their relationship is in huge amounts of trouble. &amp;#8212; Sarah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ausiello:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any signs of trouble in the first episode, but the hour isn&amp;rsquo;t really about them; it&amp;rsquo;s about Warrick. If anything, the one significant scene they &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; share in the Oct. 9 opener is rather moving and, dare I say, hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The well-heeled wore their compassion on their designer threads as hundreds of animal lovers turned out Saturday evening for a star-studded gala at the Animal Acres farm animal sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrities such as actors James Cromwell, Jorja Fox, John Schneider, Marc Vann and Alicia Silverstone were among the approximately 300 people who mingled with the sanctuary&amp;rsquo;s 150 cows, pigs, goats, turkeys and chickens for an evening of vegan food, music and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actress Jorja Fox, who starred on &amp;ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&amp;rdquo; said she is a longtime Bauston supporter and follower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vegetarian for a very long time, and this place, I think, exemplifies so many ways the microcosm of the macrocosm of the microcosm. If you can spend a little time with these creatures, you can connect them again to animals that you love, which I think helps everybody remember the importance of treating them humanely and with dignity. These are, you know, the lucky animals that have fallen off the backs of trucks and stuff. If you want to help the environment, go vegetarian,&amp;rdquo; Fox said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fall TV preview: &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; &amp;#8212; How the crime procedural will solve murders without its &amp;ldquo;King,&amp;rdquo; William Peterson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Lee Smith (&amp;ldquo;The L Word&amp;rdquo;) will also join the cast in episode 3 as a young and sarcastic &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; named Riley Adams. But perhaps the most noteworthy season 9 addition is a blast from the past. Jorja Fox &amp;ndash; whose character, Sara Sidle, walked out on both her job and her engagement to Gil &amp;ndash; will return, just 11 months after quitting the show, to help solve the murder of Dourdan&amp;rsquo;s Warrick Brown. &amp;ldquo;Even though I agreed to make myself available in the future, I was surprised to be coming back so soon,&amp;rdquo;&amp;#8216; admits Fox, 40, who was vacationing in Costa Rica last March when she received the call to return to &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo;. Fox knew that Petersen was negotiating his exit but had no idea that Dourdan was leaving too. &amp;ldquo;It was definitely an &amp;#8216;Are you sitting down?&amp;rsquo; phone call. Like, &amp;#8216;How many rum punches have you had?&amp;lsquo;&amp;rdquo; Since the show was trying to make up for lost time due to the 100-day writers&amp;rsquo; strike, Fox headed to set last May to film this season&amp;rsquo;s first two episodes. Though excited to be back (she&amp;rsquo;ll appear in another episode this fall), Fox admits that things are way different from how she left Sara in November. &amp;ldquo;This is probably the most in the dark I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the history of my character, even when I did season 1 and there was just a paragraph description,&amp;rdquo; says Fox. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re very much in uncharted territory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s because the show has never had to account for the departures of three major characters. Warrick&amp;rsquo;s tragic arc is wrapped up in the premiere (Dourdan is back for the episode), but Sara still has some personal business to attend to &amp;ndash; namely, that Dear John letter she left for Gil before fleeing the lab. As far as Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) and Nick Stokes (George Eads) are concerned, Sara left to visit her mom in San Francisco. Fox is loath to spoil it for fans, but suggests Sara&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Gil is about to take an unexpected turn. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely more to say about this,&amp;rdquo; teases Fox. &amp;ldquo;When you see the premiere, all bets are off. By the end, everyone&amp;rsquo;s going to be rethinking their idea of the characters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the million-dollar question facing &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; this season: How will Gil be leaving Las Vegas? Fortunately, death is not an option. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get the four-episode brain tumor, the countdown to Grissom&amp;rsquo;s death,&amp;rdquo; says Petersen. Unfortunately for Gil/Sara fans, a wedding is unlikely. &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; has never been one to play up the soapy aspects of its characters &amp;ndash; the most romantic moment to date was when Sara rubbed goop off Gil&amp;rsquo;s face in season 2 &amp;ndash; so it&amp;rsquo;s doubtful the show will start now (though we&amp;rsquo;d gladly settle for more sexual tension between Gil and Melinda Clarke&amp;rsquo;s Lady Heather, who&amp;rsquo;ll return in episode 5). &amp;ldquo;You cannot try to create what you think the audience wants,&amp;rdquo; explains Petersen. &amp;ldquo;If you try to appease them, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna feel hollow and false. All we want to do is the right things for the character.&amp;rdquo; Which are? &amp;ldquo;There are important changes happening in Grissom,&amp;rdquo; Petersen continues. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s solving crimes, he&amp;rsquo;s trying to deal with losing Sara and Warrick. He&amp;rsquo;s not someone who&amp;rsquo;s used to dealing with anything personal. That goes to the heart of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing right now. Where does he end up?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as important is where exactly &amp;ldquo;CSI&amp;rdquo; ends up once Petersen is gone. Fox, for one, is not so sure she wants to know. &amp;ldquo;For me, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be the same show,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;ll never be the same again with the loss of Billy. He&amp;rsquo;s the protagonist, he&amp;rsquo;s the eyes of the show, all roads start and end with him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;None of us wanted her to go, least of all Gil Grissom &amp;hellip; so it&amp;rsquo;s great news that Jorja Fox, aka CSI Sara Sidle, will return to reprise her role in season nine. Fox is expected to appear in the first three episodes of the year as the team lay Warrick Brown to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t bank on any resolution to the truncated love-story between Grissom and Sara, though. As Fox recently told &amp;ldquo;TV Guide&amp;rdquo;, talking about their feelings isn&amp;rsquo;t something the pair find easy: &amp;ldquo;As a couple, they are a little dysfunctional in some ways, but in other ways, they are fabulous. In areas of communicating their hearts, it&amp;rsquo;s never been a specialty for either of them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope this time she doesn&amp;rsquo;t say goodbye in a letter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was simply huge, and security was unlike anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced, even when I visited Guantanamo Bay. Fencing, TSA, you name it, police were everywhere. And it was like walking into a television set. The celebrities were everywhere. Chevy Chase, Jorja Fox (late of CSI), guys from &amp;ldquo;The Daily Show&amp;rdquo; Rosey Grier (in a wheelchair and gray-haired now) Rep. Murtha, Spike Lee, Blizter, and so on and so forth.

&lt;p&gt;I was afraid that our celebration wouldn&amp;rsquo;t feel very intimate in such a huge venue but the architects who put the show together did an amazing job. I wandered around trading pins for the first couple of hours; got a picture taken with Roland Martin and saw Jessie Jackson. Our section was right behind California where Jorja Fox, who plays Sarah Sidle on CSI and the Mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom (I got pictures with both).&lt;/p&gt;
