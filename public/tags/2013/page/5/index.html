		<p><strong>Jorja Fox plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle in <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em>, a crime drama series that has more than 60 million viewers worldwide. Here, she tells <em>TV Choice</em> how it feels to have such an amazing fan base. But she also reflects on her other roles in <em>ER</em> and <em>The West Wing</em>, and talks about her work as a conservationist campaigner</strong></p>

<p>**<em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</em> is currently in its 13th season. So how have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?<br />
**The biggest compliment is that last year we were the number one show in the world again. So I have to say a big thank you to all our international fans. Our ratings have also been going up this year in America. It&rsquo;s really rare for ratings to dip, then for them to go back up. Especially after all this time. Honestly, every week we go to bed wondering how we can keep on entertaining people and keep people watching.</p>

<p>**<em>Pirates Of The Caribbean</em> producer Jerry Bruckheimer is a co-creator of the show. Is he still heavily involved in its development?<br />
**Yes, I think he&rsquo;s got a creative force in all the projects he&rsquo;s a part of. We were the first TV show that his company had produced. And it&rsquo;s hard to believe that, after 13 years, we have much of the original creative team still on board.</p>

<p>**Your big break came in <em>ER</em> in the mid-Nineties. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?<br />
**For me, it was the first time that people were really going to see my work. So I was scared senseless. On the night I got the job, I honestly almost drove to Mexico, because I was so terrified. I nearly told them I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. But it was very thrilling for me to work with people who were so talented. And a great honour.</p>

<p>**And then you joined <em>The West Wing</em>&hellip;<br />
**</span><em>The West Wing</em> was one of the most special moments in my life. I never thought that someone like myself would get to be part of the political process. It was an election year in 2000 in the States, so I found myself in places in Washington DC, and I never imagined that would happen.</p>

<p>**Have you also produced a documentary about the plight of elephants in Thailand?<br />
**</span>Yes, it&rsquo;s called <em>How I Became An Elephant</em>, and it&rsquo;s about a 14 year-old-girl who travels from California to Thailand to see an elephant. It&rsquo;s a conservation film, and a film about habitat. I teamed up with a film-maker here in the US who&rsquo;d been living in Thailand since 2004. It&rsquo;s in film festivals right now. We&rsquo;re looking at a couple of companies [for distribution] but you can always look for the movie. We have a website called howibecameanelephant.com  you can find out where it&rsquo;s showing there.</p>

		<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Sara Gilbert:</strong> Our first guest made a name for herself playing strong female characters on shows like ER and The West Wing, and has been solving crimes for more than a decade as analyst Sara Sidle on the most watched TV show in the world: CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Take a look.</p>

<p>[Clip from &ldquo;Sheltered&rdquo;]</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Please welcome Jorja Fox!</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &hellip; two hour The Talk special today?</p>

<p><strong>Julie Chen:</strong> Oh yes, we&rsquo;re taking over the network. Two hour special, Affiliates take notice.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> There&rsquo;s so much to talk about</p>

<p><strong>Aisha Tyler:</strong> I know!</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Well we were just talking about disastrous vacations, in light of Heidi Klum&rsquo;s son almost drowning in the ocean. Have you ever had a disastrous vacation?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> You know, I had to really &#8212; I&rsquo;ve had so many disastrous, I had sort of sit and think about which one I wanted to talk about. Nothing nearly as excited as yours [Sharon Osborne]. I am also prone to food poisoning on the road. My family went to Europe when I was 13, I went with my mom and my dad and my grandmother, who was in her y&rsquo;know late seventies, eighties, at the time. And we take the train to Paris and, you guys have probably done this, there are several stops and we hit like &#8216;Paris North.&rsquo; And the worst part is my family speaks French. So we put my grandmother on the platform and we&rsquo;re passing bags out, like twelve bags, and the train leaves. So not only do we leave my grandmother on the platform in Paris, but it&rsquo;s the wrong platform. It isn&rsquo;t even Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> [laughing] Oh no!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It took about two and a half hours to circle back, go back an get her. My mom was in tears, she thought she was going to have a heart attack, she&rsquo;s all alone. But she was just kind of sitting on the bags with a cappuccino. Enjoying the day. [group laughter] Yeah, that&rsquo;s my favorite disaster.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Now, you actually had another experience in Europe, before you became an actress, when you were seventeen you moved to Italy, right? To try and be a model.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yes, &#8216;try&rsquo; is the operative word.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> But how did that go? I heard you almost ended up homeless?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know where you heard that rumor, but it&rsquo;s one of the true ones. You know, this is- My manager sent me with five-hundred dollars and said &ldquo;Take $500, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of money, you&rsquo;re going to start working right away with Seventeen.&rdquo; And I was partnered up with another model, who was all of 21, and she was going to be the smart one, you know, and sort of the savvy one. And we get there and she tells me she had <em>two</em>-hundred dollars, she didn&rsquo;t tell anyone she only had $200. We had $700, even in the 80s, in Europe, you&rsquo;re out of money pretty fast. We got kicked out of our pension and, quite honestly, a young American architectural student in Milan saved my life and let me live with him for five or six weeks, until- It was sort of the closet I ever experienced college dorm life, with a student in Milan.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> And then you moved into one of those model &#8212;</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Yeah, we got on our feet- We did start working. It took a little longer than we thought. And yeah, we moved into a model&rsquo;s pension, which was also like my &#8216;college&rsquo; experience.</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It happened to be a girls pension, a woman&rsquo;s pension and I was one of the youngest there. Women would sneak their boyfriends in several times a week, which was kind of fun. But one of the things I loved the most, and there was so much traveling at that age, you know everybody kind of looked after each other, but there were women there from all over the world, and young girls, and &#8212; All of them, we&rsquo;d go out to dinner and you could be from Thailand, and maybe you&rsquo;re from Iceland, and you&rsquo;re from France, and everyone would speak in English together. Broken English. So the conversations were pretty simple &#8212; not because we were models &#8212; there was a launguage-</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> You joined the cast of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation very- in the year it debuted and- [applause] Yes, and I was on it!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Alma Mater!</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> &#8212; And I loved working there. It was an incredible show. And it&rsquo;s so hard to believe that you&rsquo;re wrapping up the thirteenth season of the show. It&rsquo;s incredible for any actor to have a job for this long and to be so successful.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> It doesn&rsquo;t happen! It just- You know when you go to acting school they prepare you. You know, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go from job to job to job to job. It&rsquo;s just kind of the nature of the business.&rdquo; And so this is a complete anomoly. None of us are prepared for it.</p>

<p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Does your kind of crime scene investigating skills from the show start to creep into your real life [laughter] after this long?</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [faux dramatic] I know all the secrets of everyone here.</p>

<p><strong>Sharon Osborne:</strong> Last season, Ted Danson joined the cast. And we love him in the show. He&rsquo;s such an amazing guy. I mean, it must be such a joy to work with him every day.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> [deadpan] He&rsquo;s a terror. He&rsquo;s horrible.</p>

<p>[group laughter]</p>

<p><strong>Osborne:</strong> He&rsquo;s naughty!</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> He&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s amazing! He&rsquo;s one of these gentlemen, you know he&rsquo;s been in the business for years, he&rsquo;s one of my heroes as an actor, and from the first day that we worked together, you kind of looked him in the eye and there was- as if we&rsquo;d know each other ten years. He&rsquo;s a master at intimacy. It&rsquo;s not forced, it&rsquo;s authentic, and it comes from, you know, like &#8216;actor to actor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I swear he&rsquo;s got wings on. Like under his jacket, there&rsquo;s wings. He is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>[group &#8216;awwww&rsquo; and applause]</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Now, in addition to your work on CSI, you work on other projects including &#8212; there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s coming out later this year, and you&rsquo;re really proud of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant.&rdquo; Tell us about that.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you for asking about that. It&rsquo;s a documentary, feature documentary, that I produced a couple years ago. It&rsquo;s really the story of a young girl, from southern California, who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. The heart of the story is that no matter how old you are or where you&rsquo;re from or where your circumstances are, if you have a passion about something, you can make a difference. One person <em>can</em> make a difference. The larger picture, of course, the umbrella is it&rsquo;s a movie about wildlife habitats and environmentalism and preserving these wild places so that these creatures can continue to have a place to live.</p>

<p>[applause]</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Chen:</strong> Jorja Fox everyone, Jorja Fox. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation airs Wednesday at ten, right here on CBS. We&rsquo;ll be back.</p>

		<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong>, who plays Sara Sidle, is proud to be part of the planet&rsquo;s favourite show</p>

<p><strong>This week, the CSI team is spooked by a case that brings back memories of their murdered colleague, Warrick Brown. How does that store compare to the rest of this series?</strong></p>

<p>This season is unique, because almost every episode impacts on one of the characters in a personal level. In an episode we shot recently, Sara&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend comes to town, and she has to grapple with that. For her, there&rsquo;s always a steady theme of love &hellip; or not! She&rsquo;s married to someone she&rsquo;s deeply in love with, but she doesn&rsquo;t see him very much.</p>

<p><strong>Of course, her husband is former colleague Gil Grissom. Were you showed when they ended up together?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the bigger surprise for me was that I returned to the show! I came back in the eighth season, when Gil was leaving, to tell that storyline. I never imagined that I would be invited to return to the show, and of course, when I was asked, I couldn&rsquo;t say no, because it&rsquo;s been such an amazing ride. I knew that Gil and Sara were going to take off, but I didn&rsquo;t know that Sara was ever going to come back.</p>

<p><strong>How have fans reacted to events like Ted Danson joining the cast?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the biggest compliment is that last year we were the most popular show in the world again. So I have to say a big thank you to all our overseas fans!</p>

<p>**You&rsquo;ve also starred in <em>The West Wing</em> but your first big break came in <em>ER</em>. What was it like landing the role of Dr Maggie Doyle?<br />
**</p>

<p>It was the first time that people were really going to see my work. So I was scared senseless. On the night I got the job, I honestly almost drove to Mexico, because I was so terrified. I nearly told them I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. But it was a great honour for me to work with people who were so talented.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;CSI Files:&ldquo;&rsquo; The season is winding down. What are some of your favorite moments from this season? Anything you would have liked to do, but werent able to?</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Daley:&ldquo;&rsquo; I was happy we brought the dog on the team. Im a real dog lover (as is over half the staff) and Sam was great in his episode. SPOILER: You may even see him in mine!</p>

<p>I personally loved what we did with Saras character this year. I know Ill lose some GSRs off my Twitter now, but &ldquo;&lsquo;Jorja Fox&rdquo;&rsquo; is an amazing actress and that was an incredible performance. Its time for Sara to become her own character, and not be defined by an off screen Grissom.</p>

<p>Also, I was glad to see &ldquo;&lsquo;David Berman&rdquo;&rsquo; get to show his comedy chops in &ldquo;Dead of the Class.&rdquo; That scene in the autopsy was brilliant, and I give Tom Mularz real props for that. Its been a great year all around. Im really proud of how strong the show is in season 13.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;CSI Files:&ldquo;&rsquo; Going into these final episodes, what can viewers expect? How is the finale looking?</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Daley:&ldquo;&rsquo; Heres one teaser  you may see someone we havent seen in years return in the finale (cryptic enough?)</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>I know you will probably give me your stock answer about &ldquo;ships&rdquo; and the realities of TV business, but don&rsquo;t you think the break-up of Sara and Grissom on *CSI* was unusually cruel to the long suffering fans of this couple? I know William Petersen won&rsquo;t be back on the show, but would it have been so bad to keep him off-screen like he has been, and let the writers keep their marriage safe and in the background? It&rsquo;s a procedural, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, not <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em>. And their fans would be content to at least know they have a good, albeit non-traditional marriage. This just seems so harsh to me. There was a carefully constructed arc for their story over 12 years; in a few episodes it seems to be completely destroyed. The show will probably not be around much longer, so why? They seem to not care about their old loyal fans, and certainly have disregarded the avid GSR fanbase. I know it&rsquo;s silly to get caught up in fictional &#8216;ships (and this is the only one I ever became invested in), but this one seemed like it would really make it after that wonderful final scene of Grissom and Sara in the jungle. Now it&rsquo;s just &hellip; ugh &hellip; so frustrating. It taints the whole series for me, and certainly erases Petersen&rsquo;s wonderful exit arc.  <em>Jan</em></p>

<p><strong>Matt Roush:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure how wonderful or satisfying Grissom&rsquo;s exit arc was  the show never really recovered from losing him  and I always found this off-camera relationship puzzling and a bit off-putting, but I&rsquo;m more upset to think I have a &ldquo;stock answer&rdquo; for this sort of thing. Because I do think you have a point where this show and these characters are concerned. At least Nick was able to express the feelings I imagine so many longtime *CSI *fans have, that we accepted and perhaps even embraced the idea of the Sara-Grissom marriage because it sustained a connection, however tenuous, with the show&rsquo;s most beloved character. I may not be as upset as the &ldquo;shippers&rdquo; about the dissolving of the marriage  how many long-distance relationships ever work?  but the way it was addressed so off-handedly, keeping the drama of the split off-stage as usual, would have to be a letdown to anyone who has an investment in these characters. That said, I thought Jorja Fox did a fine job expressing Sara&rsquo;s sadness and loneliness, even in the context of yet another episode in which a crime-solver is accused of a crime she so clearly didn&rsquo;t commit.</p>
