		<p>Dog fighting rings, canned hunting, factory farming, and even the cruelty behind shark fin soup have all been topics on the popular CBS drama &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo;, and actress &ldquo;&lsquo;Jorja Fox&rdquo;&rsquo; takes pride in her shows coverage of these issues. Jorja plays forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the long running series. In real life, she volunteers as an ambassador for Animal Defenders International.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calling attention to these issueswhether it is on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; or with Animal Defenders Internationalis a passion of mine,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;&ldquo;CSI&rdquo;s writers care about these issues too, and do such a great job in weaving them into the show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;ADI Ambassador&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jorja, who has been on &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; since its inception in 2000, considers herself fortunate to have landed a role that she cherishes. She also is grateful to be a spokesperson for Animal Defenders International (ADI). &ldquo;Tim Phillips and Jan Creamer, the husband and wife team who founded ADI, have done so much to call attention to rescue and to stop animal abuse,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;Im honored to work with them and to serve as an ambassador for ADI.&rdquo;</p>

<p>ADI, which was launched in 1990, publishes reports, educates the public, and drafts legislation for animals worldwide. One of their latest animal welfare projects was exposing the cruel treatment of circus animals in Bolivia. &ldquo;They went undercover to rescue and relocate 29 circus lions via airlift to safe sanctuaries in the United States,&rdquo; says Jorja. (A short film about the rescue can be seen on ADIs website.)</p>

<p>Through her work at ADI, Jorja has done public service announcements and testified before Congress. Jorja is a 2012 recipient of ADIs Animal Champion Award for her dedication to sustaining safe environments for animals in entertainment.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;A Long Time Love Affair with Animals&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Born in New York City, Jorja moved with her family to Melbourne Beach, FL, when she was about three. &ldquo;Its a barrier island, and there was a lot more wildlife back then than there is now,&rdquo; she laments. &ldquo;You could see dolphins in the ocean, sea turtles, and even alligators. It was the wilderness for my parents, who are both from New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learned a lot about conservation from my grandmother, and my family always cared about animals,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;Caring for the environment impacts all of uspeople and animals. We had a family dog, and lots of wildlife around us, which I grew to appreciate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, she has a three-year old rescue dog, which she says, &ldquo;is the most brilliant dog in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Animals and the Environment&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of people dont see the connection between animal extinction and the environment,&rdquo; says Jorja, who recently produced an award winning documentary called &ldquo;How I Became An Elephant&rdquo;, which tracks the journey of a young girl who travels to Thailand to rescue an elephant. &ldquo;People dont know that without elephants there would be horrible droughts,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Elephants are known as a keystone species because of their impact on their environment and their impact on other species that share their space. &ldquo;Elephants are very good at finding underground water,&rdquo; Jorja explains. &ldquo;They locate water and dig watering holes. Without that water, other animals and humans would be harmed. Mass extinctions could occur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elephants also disperse seeds through their digestive systems. Thanks to elephants who spread these seeds, more plants appear, which other animals are dependent on. &ldquo;Its an important cycle,&rdquo; says Jorja. &ldquo;That is why we all need to care about animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Looking at your filmography, you’ve been on a ton of great shows with some amazing actors, <em>Reaper</em>, <em>House</em>, <em>Buffy</em>. Was there an actor you worked with that really surprised you?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been so lucky that I just walked on set after set with just such welcoming actors, and that’s great because you hear horror stories. But I remember having to do a very emotional scene on <em>CSI</em>, and at the time, <em>CSI</em> was the #1 show, 30 million viewers each week, absurd numbers, you would think that if there was one set there would be big egos, it would be that set. But I had this one emotional scene across from Jorja Fox. She was so gracious and open and warm, it helped me get to where I needed to be. I remember that vividly. They shot me first, she was so patient. I had to excuse myself from the set for a moment, and she was so open to what I needed as an actor. Here I was just a guest spot, and she was a regular on the #1 show on television, and she was focused on making me comfortable.</p>

		<p>As per usual, our cover models are more than just pretty faces. They are co-producers of an important new film called <em>How I Became an Elephant</em>. This powerful documentary follows 14-year-old Juliette West who embarks on a journey to learn more about elephants in their native land. After single-handedly raising the funs for her journey, she finds herself in Southeast Asia, meeting and working with her hero, Lek Chailert. Lek is known as &ldquo;The Elephand Lady,&rdquo; and has risked her life and freedom for more than three decades to protect elephants from illegal trade and abuse. This is the story of two women, one from the East, one from the West, coming together on common ground to save elephants. It&rsquo;s also the coming of age story of a passionate young woman joining forces with a wise and experienced animal advocate on an enlightening journey of compassion, action and hope. The message: no matter what your age, your ethnicity, or disposition, you can make a difference. As we follow Juliette on this journey, and she uncovers the plight of these magnificent creatures, the film poses the poignant question, &ldquo;how far would you go to save a species?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>THE PRODUCERS</strong></p>

<p>Our cover gal and co-producer of this film, Jorja Fox, is best known for her role on two of the longest running television series ever. In the 90s she played (vegetarian) Dr. Maggie Doyle on ER, and for the past thirteen years she has played (vegetarian) forensic scientist Sara Sidle on the CBS Emmy-Award winning series <em>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.</em> Knowing Jorja has been a vegetarian for the past 25 years of her real life, I had to ask how she managed to get to play vegetarian characters in these two popular, long-running shows.</p>

<p>Jorja says that she&rsquo;s very proud to play vegetarian characters, and although the story lines were not her idea, she says &ldquo;I did go to bat for pigs on both occasions.&rdquo; On ER one of the writers, invited Jorja to practice doing sutures. He suggested that she take a pig&rsquo;s foot home for the weekend. Jorja asked him if there were any other options and he said, &ldquo;Why? Are you a vegetarian?&rdquo; He traded out the pig&rsquo;s foot for an eggplant and asked if he could make the character (Maggie Doyle) vegetarian too. She was thrilled.</p>

<p>On CSI, a situation arose where a pig&rsquo;s body was to be used to recreate the timeline of a woman&rsquo;s murder. When Jorja read the script, she called the writer to ask if a fake pig would be used, and he also asked, &ldquo;Why? Are you a vegetarian?&rdquo; Once again her character (Sara Sidle) became a vegetarian too. Since then, Jorja&rsquo;s CSI character has gotten to do some pretty cool things in relation to her vegetarianism, and CSI has highlighted several animal welfare issues including shark fin soup, canned hunting, and dog fighting.</p>

<p>Jorja says that when she met the director of <em>How I Became an Elephant</em>, Tim Gorski, she was on the edge of her seat listening to his stories of living and working in Thailand with the elephants. She says, &ldquo;I have this amazing job in Los Angeles but I dream from time to time of working in the field. Teaming up with him was a way to support the amazing work he was doing and selfishly, kind of live vicariously through him for a little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passion the Jorja has for this cause is apparent as she explains, &ldquo;I cant&rsquo; stress enough how dire things are for elephants right now. The poaching issue in Africa has exploded again over the last few years and the habitat issue is at critical mass. People have to act now. Twenty years from now will almost certainly be too late. We have the intelligence and the tools to fix so many of these issues and frankly, people need elephants for their own survival. If elephans go the way of extinction, Africa&rsquo;s rain forests will be right behind them and the air that people breath will be right behind that.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>How will CSI shake things up to conclude its 13th season? By putting one of their own in jeopardy, thats how.</p>

<p>On tonights finale Elisabeth Harnoiss Morgan Brody will go undercover (as a hooker, no less) and - SPOILER ALERT! - she may find herself in harms way.</p>

<p>In this exclusive Q&amp;A, actress tells me how the episode is laid out, who shed love to have more scenes with next season and a lot more&hellip;</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>TVF:</strong> Would you like to see more of a romance part of the show or do you think its better left as like maybe teasing and little elements here and there?</p>

<p><strong>EH:</strong> I think theyve already made some bold choices by giving so much character driven material to people like me and my character and Lisa Shues character have all gotten incredible personal storylines as well as Jorja [Fox] and Eric [Szmanda], everybodys been giving it much more of their own life to the show in this season. So I think that, that opens the door.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>TVF:</strong> Assuming you survive the cliff hanger, who would you like to see Morgan kind of interact with a lot more maybe she hasnt?</p>

<p><strong>EH:</strong> I think apparently I would love to work with some of the women more. I understand why but theres only three of us so theres a lot more men on the show. A lot of our chemistry in our personal lives in terms of us becoming friends and just having things in common I think has sort of helped the writers find the directions to go concerning a storylineit doesnt hurt that if Morgan is going to have a crush on Erics character that they actually are good friends and we really like each other. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>But I think that the people that I really would want to work with more than I have thus far are Lisa Shue and Jorja. I had a little bit with Jorja and I had a little bit with Lisa but I would love for us girls to have to band together for a really cool power girl episode. Not a Charlies Angels kind of thing but an episode that requires that it has to be them that come to the forefront. Weve all said that we would love to have that kind of an episode for the three of us because we all really like each other and were all very opinionated strong women.</p>
