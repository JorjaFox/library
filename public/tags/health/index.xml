      <description>&lt;p&gt;Macy’s Passport Fund supports agencies providing HIV/AIDS programming in certain counties with an operating Macy’s store location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the nation&amp;rsquo;s longest-running HIV/AIDS fundraisers, The Macy&amp;rsquo;s and American Express HIV/AIDS Fundraiser (often referred to as Passport) has brought the excitement of live theatre and the best of Macy&amp;rsquo;s fall collections for men, women and children to audiences while raising over $10 million for HIV/AIDS agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja attended the fundraiser in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Susan G. Komen for the Cure</title>
      <link>http://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/susan-g-komen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Susan G. Komen fought breast cancer with her heart, body and soul. Throughout her diagnosis, treatments, and endless days in the hospital, she spent her time thinking of ways to make life better for other women battling breast cancer instead of worrying about her own situation. That concern for others continued even as Susan neared the end of her fight. Moved by Susan&amp;rsquo;s compassion for others and committed to making a difference, Nancy G. Brinker promised her sister that she would do everything in her power to end breast cancer forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That promise is now Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the global leader of the breast cancer movement, having invested nearly $1.5 billion since inception in 1982. As the world&amp;rsquo;s largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists, we&amp;rsquo;re working together to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find the cures. Thanks to events like the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure, and generous contributions from our partners, sponsors and fellow supporters, we have become the largest source of nonprofit funds dedicated to the fight against breast cancer in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja worked with Susan G Komen in 2003. She also appeared in television ads for the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The whole is more than the sum of its parts.&amp;rdquo; - Aristotle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What A Pair!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a non-profit 501c3 that was created when a personal tragedy  motivated three Hollywood producers  to do something to give back. Co-founders &lt;strong&gt;Jo Levi DiSante&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jody Price&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Ruth Stalford&lt;/strong&gt; believe that by partnering the right people with the right organizations, allowing folks to share their talent and expertise, we can make the world a better place and enrich lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2002, they have worked with some of the best-known female talent to successfully stage eight Broadway-caliber productions of celebrity duets. They have raised over $3 million dollars to support basic and clinical breast cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-a-pair-4-2006:4f06e2a771f7fc81af6e73df88186867&#34;&gt;What a Pair 4 (2006)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja performed alongside Marg Helgenberger at What a Pair! 4, to benefit Dr. Armando Giuliano&amp;rsquo;s breast cancer research. The event was held at the John Wayne Cancer Institute on June 11, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
