      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most amazing things about today, not only is the food gonna be way better than it ever is at my place &amp;ldquo;(laughs)&amp;rdquo;, and, and, and, far more beautifully prepared, uh, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to cook or do any dishes I don&amp;rsquo;t think - maybe I do, but nobody&amp;rsquo;s told me yet so that&amp;rsquo;d be really fun. &amp;ldquo;(laughs)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; What a better way to spend this holiday that we really sorta celebrate peace and in a really peaceful way eating vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PETA Gala and Humanitarian Awards</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vegetarian since I was nineteen. I come from like a French-Canadian family who ate meat and potatoes every day, three times a day for my entire youth, and I used to tease the heck out of my friends that were vegetarians, and I had a lot of &amp;lsquo;em, and then when I became a vegetarian I just decided that I was going to try and learn as much I could so that when people teased me, maybe I&amp;rsquo;d have a couple of things to say. So PETA very quickly in New York City was an organization that I&amp;rsquo;d heard about, and I read about, and I started going to rallies, and demonstrations, and protests. Um, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a huge supporter and fan of ever since, y&amp;rsquo;know, you guys rock and I think, you know, you, you do it in such a sort of an alternatively exciting, and fresh, and, um, confrontational way, and that&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jorja Fox, I&amp;rsquo;m an actor, I&amp;rsquo;m a guitar player, I&amp;rsquo;m a surfer, uh, I&amp;rsquo;m a sister and a daughter, and I am a vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; How long have you been involved with PETA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan and supporter and rally-er from many many years, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vegetarian, so that&amp;rsquo;s like forty years ago, you know, fifty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; You haven&amp;rsquo;t been a vegetarian for forty years, you haven&amp;rsquo;t been on this planet for forty years. &amp;ldquo;(Jorja laughs)&amp;rdquo; How long have you been a vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Uh, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna laugh, um, I&amp;rsquo;d say six- eighteen years, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; Most of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah, since I was a teenager or so, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; What was the epiphany, what, what was it made you become vegetarian?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Y&amp;rsquo;know, it was a meatball sandwich in Brooklyn one afternoon and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was about it, but y&amp;rsquo;know I, those little moments, I had friends, and people I&amp;rsquo;d gone out with who were vegetarians and bands that I liked that were vegetarian, Morrisey&amp;rsquo;s here tonight, I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to see them, and uh, and it just kinda all came together over a meatball hero in Brooklyn one day and that was that. And then I was really that person who would tease those people quite a bit, you know, the type of person that&amp;rsquo;d be &amp;#8216;oh, y&amp;rsquo;know, well vegetables are alive too and you&amp;rsquo;re killing vegetables if you eat them&amp;rsquo;, and so I decided to get as educated as I could, cause I, I, you know, didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get the same teasing back at me after I was a vegetarian, so I found PETA very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; Would you do one of those ads for PETA, would you take off your clothes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Go naked? Maybe. I might, yeah. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been naked yet actually, so I might. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look good enough, but I&amp;rsquo;ll do it, yeah. &amp;ldquo;(laughs)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; Anything new, anything upcoming for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Um, we got a bunch of CSI coming out, and it&amp;rsquo;s all very horrible, and there&amp;rsquo;s lots of dead people, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited. I have a little play I&amp;rsquo;m producing that&amp;rsquo;s going to London in March 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s the play about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Uh, it&amp;rsquo;s the story, it&amp;rsquo;s actually based on a true story of a young woman from a small town in England that comes to America in the late sixties to follow her dreams, so it&amp;rsquo;s very, yeah, takes advantage of New York City in the early seventies; it&amp;rsquo;s a good story, lotta heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VegTV&lt;/strong&gt; Anywhere we can follow that? Is it on the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jorja Fox&lt;/strong&gt; Uh, yeah, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dearbernard.com/&#34;&gt;dearbernard.com&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s on the Internet, it&amp;rsquo;s a full length original musical, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see. We put it up in L.A. last year, and we&amp;rsquo;re taking, slowly getting to London in March.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animal Acres</title>
      <link>http://jorjafox.net/library/advocacy/animal-acres/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Animal Acres is a farmed animal sanctuary and compassionate living center located just 45 minutes from Los Angeles. Animal Acres works to promote compassionate living through its farmed animal rescue and refuge efforts, public education and outreach, and advocacy projects to prevent cruelty to farmed animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox has attended many events for Animal Acres. She is also a supporter of &amp;ldquo;ACI: Animal Cruelty Investigations&amp;rdquo;, a sub-site of Animal Acres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The way animals are treated to produce meat, milk, and eggs needs to be investigated, exposed, and stopped. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to be a supporter of ANIMAL CRUELTY INVESTIGATIONS. ACI investigators go to animal &amp;lsquo;crime scenes&amp;rsquo; in our nation&amp;rsquo;s stockyards, factory farms, and slaughterhouses. Documenting what most of us don&amp;rsquo;t want to see, their undercover video footage and evidence of blatant animal cruelty is helping gain needed humane protection for cows, pigs, and chickens, too.&amp;lsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actress &amp;amp; Advocate
Jorja Fox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2005:d07626381af40fc49883596a6afd8ef0&#34;&gt;2005&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, Animal Acres celebrated Thanksgiving in their own way, where guests get to feed a turkey rather than eating one. Special guests included Jorja Fox and Daryl Hannah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2007:d07626381af40fc49883596a6afd8ef0&#34;&gt;2007&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox was the Gala Chairperson of this year&amp;rsquo;s Animal Acres Gala, which was held to raise money for a farmed animal sanctuary in Los Angeles. August 25th, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2008:d07626381af40fc49883596a6afd8ef0&#34;&gt;2008&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja Fox attended the Country Hoe Down on Saturday, May 3. She was also a recipient of the 2008 Gandhi Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all heard the expression &amp;lsquo;STAR POWER&amp;rsquo;, but actress and animal advocate Jorja Fox, has given that phrase new meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a leading actress on West Win, ER, and most recently, CSI, Jorja Fox used her celebrity status to educate millions of viewers about animal abuse &amp;ndash; both by working with producers and writers to air animal issues and video on episodes, and convincing the show to make her character a vegetarian. Her audience is in the millions &amp;ndash; and thanks to Jorja &amp;ndash; millions of people have been educated about the cruelties of canned hunting, dog fighting, and food animal slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorja was one of Animal Acres first celebrity supporters, lending her voice and participation for our &amp;lsquo;Thankful Turkey Celebration&amp;rsquo; in 2005. In addition to addressing the audience about her personal commitment to vegetarianism, Jorja jumped right into farm chores, helping feed the turkeys and giving bottles to rescued piglets. Jorja has always rolled up her sleeves on other &amp;lsquo;farm chore days&amp;rsquo; too, and she is always willing to do whatever is needed around the farm, from mucking barns to cleaning pigs&amp;rsquo; ears!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, we were honored to have Jorja serve as our 2007 Gala Chair, where she played a vital role is helping us raise over $100,000 for farmed animal rescue and humane enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to find the words to thank Jorja for being such a dedicated friend of Animal Acres, so we gave her our highest honor &amp;ndash; we named a farmed animal after her! We are also honored to give Jorja this year&amp;rsquo;s GANDHI AWARD for her outstanding commitment to providing rescue, sanctuary, and hope for farmed animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
