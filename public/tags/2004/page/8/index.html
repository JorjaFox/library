		<p><strong>ALARM CLOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE:</strong> Fired <em>CSI</em> actor <strong>George Eads</strong> claims he missed work last week because he simply overslept. &ldquo;They think it&rsquo;s about money and it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Eads told reporters at the TCA press tour in L.A., where he was promoting TNT&rsquo;s <em>Evel Knievel</em> film. &ldquo;I overslept. I woke up white as a sheet three-and-a-half hours after I was supposed to be on the set.&rdquo; Eads adds that he called <em>CSI</em> to say he&rsquo;d be coming in late, and was told &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo; Echoing the fateful words of CBS chief <strong>Les Moonves</strong>, the 37-year-old said &ldquo;a contract is a contract,&rdquo; insisting he wasn&rsquo;t holding out for a raise of his $100,000-per-episode salary. &ldquo;Let me tell you, I&rsquo;ve apologized nine ways to Sunday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big misunderstanding, straight up. I want all this to work out. <em>CSI</em> is a part of who I am.&rdquo; No word yet from his fellow prodigal thespian, <strong>Jorja Fox</strong>, who was last seen shining Les Moonves&rsquo; shoes with <em>CSI: New York</em>&#8216;s <strong>Carmine Giovinazzo</strong>.</p>

		<p>Two dismissed &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;ers learned the hard way:</p>

<p>Everybody really does love &ldquo;Raymond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firing of two &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; stars in a salary dispute was fair and intended to help the TV industry draw the fiscal line, CBS chief Les Moonves said Sunday.</p>

<p>Actors Jorja Fox and George Eads, who play investigators Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes on the hit CBS crime drama, were dumped last week when they failed to report for work on the upcoming season, he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There comes a point where we feel a contract is a contract. &hellip; We all have to look out for the future of the network television business,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Translation: &ldquo;You think we won&rsquo;t be able to find young hotties willing to wield cotton swabs and squint at carpet fibers for half the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deals with Fox and Eads were renegotiated after two years and a raise was offered for this fifth season although there was no contractual obligation to do so, he said. The actors reportedly wanted a raise in their $100,000-per-episode pay.</p>

<p>Discussions had been under way with their lawyers and there were certain &ldquo;veiled threats about their not showing up,&rdquo; Moonves said. They probably got the idea last year, when &ldquo;Everybody Loves Raymond&rdquo; star Brad Garrett successfully staged a salary walkout. Asked to compare the &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; actors&rsquo; situation with that of the Emmy-winning Garrett, Moonves was vague.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did a negotiation, we brought him (Garrett) back into the fold,&rdquo; Moonves said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very happy we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Translation: &ldquo;He won an Emmy, for heaven&rsquo;s sake &hellip; and he&rsquo;s big enough to stomp me into next week, so I signed the check.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A call seeking comment from the actors (surprise!) was not immediately returned Sunday by their publicist.</p>

<p>Production will be halted this week while script revisions are made, Moonves said. The roles played by Fox and Eads haven&rsquo;t been recast but the network is &ldquo;looking at certain people,&rdquo; Moonves added.</p>

<p>Another cast member, Marg Helgenberger, reported to work as scheduled last week, he said. William Petersen, who co-stars and is a producer on the series, was on call for next week.</p>

<p>Asked if he was concerned about damage to one of TV&rsquo;s top-rated series, Moonves said, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Later, he said it was possible cast members Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle might play bigger roles.</p>

		<p>&#8216;CSI&rsquo; SOAP OPERA: When &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; regulars George Eads and Jorja Fox tried to hold out for more money and failed to report for work last week, CBS abruptly fired them for breach of contract. Moonves isn&rsquo;t exactly shedding tears. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to realize a contract is a contract,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When somebody doesn&rsquo;t show up for work, that tells us that, OK, they don&rsquo;t want to work for us anymore. That&rsquo;s our attitude.&rdquo; Though CBS is supposedly looking for actors to replace them, Moonves admitted to fears that the firings might harm the show. &ldquo;We like those actors, they&rsquo;re very good people,&rdquo; said a more conciliatory Moonves, leading to speculation that CBS might reconsider rehiring them.</p>

		<p><strong>From Jean_Jenegan:</strong> <strong>Please tell me that Jorja and George will be back on <em>CSI!</em>!</strong></p>

<p>I wish I could! The past two days at Press Tour have been CBS, and everyone, including pres Les Moonves and EP Anthony Zucker, says they are fired, for good. Me sad. You?</p>

<p><strong>From larrypigtails:</strong> <strong>What the f-k is CBS thinking firing George and Jorja?</strong></p>

<p>That has been <em>the</em> question at Press Tour. I have a <em>very</em> long quote from Les Moonves with his take on what happened, just for you. Here goes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of old-fashioned. I believe when you and I shake hands and we sign a deal, it&rsquo;s a deal. A deal is a deal. And if by the fourth episode of the season, we had decided that George Eades, we wanted to fire him, guess what? I couldn&rsquo;t pick up a phone and say, &#8216;You know what, I want to fire you, but the contract really doesn&rsquo;t matter, so I&rsquo;m not going to pay you for the other 18 episodes that I owe you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We feel very important that it&rsquo;s time people realize that a contract is a contract. By the way, what hasn&rsquo;t been written is we renegotiated with these people after the second year of the show already once. What also has not been reported is we did offer them a raise, even though we didn&rsquo;t have to. When somebody doesn&rsquo;t show up for work, that says to us that, okay, they don&rsquo;t want to work for us anymore, and that&rsquo;s our attitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also said the difference between G. &amp; J.&rsquo;s actions and the Brad Garrett thing last season is that they didn&rsquo;t show up to work &ldquo;at all,&rdquo; and he didn&rsquo;t appreciate their &ldquo;veiled threats.&rdquo; And more tidbits: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t recast <em>CSI</em>. We are looking at certain people, and we&rsquo;re talking to certain people about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are going to shut down production this week, and then we&rsquo;re going to start the following week..we&rsquo;re rewriting some scripts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>From aver:</strong> **So, is it just that Dourdan, et al. weren&rsquo;t pushing for more money, à la the <em>Friends</em> cast? **</p>

<p>Yes. And the problem is this, they aren&rsquo;t Monica and Chandler, and there was no <em>Friends: NY</em>, <em>Friends: Miami</em> and <em>Friends: Vegas</em>. Personally, I think these spinoffs simply showed Les Moonves that the shows can hold up on their own, regardless of any one or two actors. And rumor has it George and Jorja were making $100k an ep. An ep. I am on the wrong side of things here&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>From reddygirl:</strong> <strong>What can you tell us about Reiko&rsquo;s character? Is she replacing Jorja on <em>CSI</em>?</strong></p>

<p>No. It&rsquo;s possible that Reiko could be recurring, but right now she is only signed on for one episode. She is <em>not</em> replacing Jorja Fox; this deal was already in place before the fallout-her character is a DNA person, so that Eric Szmanda&rsquo;s character can get out in the field. She is not taking over for Jorja, I repeat, not taking over for Jorja. They&rsquo;re looking for another permanent cast member for that.</p>

		<p>Walking off the set or halting production of a new season is nothing new to the television industry. It&rsquo;s a right of passage, a game to play, in the struggle of actor contract negotiations. Just this year, the six principal voices of the Simpson&rsquo;s characters halted production demanding an increase in salary from $125,000 per episode to $360,000.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p>However last week, the balance of power shifted back to CBS and all the studios with the firing of actors George Eads and Jorja Fox who play play investigators Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle on the hit CBS crime drama CSI, as Les Moonves, CBS chief, called the duo&rsquo;s bluff. Fox and Eads were negotiating for a raise in their $100,000-per-episode pay.</p>

<p>&#8216;There comes a point where we feel a contract is a contract. &hellip; We all have to look out for the future of the network television business,&rsquo; said Moonves. Differing from his 2003 policy of just telling the writers to rewrite the first episode of &ldquo;Everybody Loves Raymond,&rdquo; to incorporate the absence of Garrett into the script, Moonves decided this time to eliminate the characters immediately by the two firings.</p>

<p>When questioned about the concern he had in regards to the top-rated series, Moonves simply said &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; It is speculated by Moonves that other cast members Eric Szmanda and Paul Guilfoyle could take over larger roles. However, there are attempts to recast the two castmembers as Moonves stated that although the characters portrayed by Eads and Fox had not been recast, CBS was &ldquo;looking at certain people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The filming of CSI has been halted for a week while scripts are edited to reflect the casting changes.</p>
