<h2 id="synopsis:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A cold case dovetails with a hot one, when a John Doe is found in the chimney of a canoodling couple. The home owner, Martin Sidley, was a suspect in the missing persons case of sixteen year-old Caroline Fiztgibbons one year previously, but is stunned to learn the body in his chimney is his son. Catherine and Warrick, who worked on Caroline&rsquo;s case, join Sara and Nick on the Sidley case, with the intent to found evidence in their old case. The blood found (which is Caroline&rsquo;s), leads them to investigate the chimney further, and Caroline&rsquo;s body is found. Martin&rsquo;s son, Tad, is also found alive, having skipped school for a few weeks to party. Before Martin learns of this, he tries to pin the body on Tad, who confronts his father. The John Doe body was, in turn, placed in the chimney by Caroline&rsquo;s father, Don, who took it from the hospital where he works, knowing that the CSIs would investigate.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara again shows her type-A personality (wanting to do everything herself) when she practically searches the entire home by herself and with her love of power tools. While she strongly dislikes cases where women (or girls) are killed or abused, she remains calm and collected as she has all season. Sara discovers the reason why a body was stuffed in the chimney, and who did it, based on the prints she recovered from the roof. Catherine, rather than Sara (despite the fact that it is Sara&rsquo;s case), confronts Caroline&rsquo;s father and discovers that he took a &lsquo;John Doe&rsquo; corpse from the hospital morgue.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:c9cd2d27e61d68083cd338c254f075a0">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara understands why Catherine and Nick want to be on the case, and quickly agrees to let them in.<br /></li>
<li>Sara again shows her taste for horror novels when she references The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allan Poe.<br /></li>
<li>Sara has no problem with heights, scampering around on the roof to gather evidence.<br /></li>
<li>Sara lets Catherine handle parts of the investigation, even though she is the primary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Willows:</strong> Warrick and I were looking for a missing person about a year ago, and we tried to get a warrant to search this residence. The owner denied us access.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Now that it&rsquo;s a crime scene, it&rsquo;s fair game, if you&rsquo;re part of the investigation.<br />
<strong>Brown:</strong> You&rsquo;re picking up what we&rsquo;re putting down.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> She was still bleeding when she was brought here.<br />
<strong>Willows:</strong> Which means that her heart was probably still beating.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> This isn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;Cask of Amontillado.&rsquo; She was sealed into a wall and left to die.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:5e585dd512d0bd2e9a96f1624409a27c">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Ina complicated and disturbing episode, Lady Heather returns when her daughter, Zoe Kessler, is found dead in the desert wearing only a bra and panties. Zoe is emaciated, branded with the number 19, her hair has been shaved off and her right hand chewed off.</p>

<p>At the autopsy, they determine one of her eyes was severed at the optic nerve, and Zoe had necrotizing faciitis, which had been injected into her blood stream causing her to rot from the inside out. Zoe had also been injected with a variety of drugs normally given to mental patients, and her severed eye belonged to a convited sex offender named Jack Londers. When found, Captain Jack appears to be less than sane, though he agrees to come to the ER, where the doctor says he was lobotomized via his empty eye socket.</p>

<p>Only after seeing her daughter&rsquo;s picture on the news does Lady Heather herself come and ID the body. She request anonymity from Brass, who keeps the information from the press, but tells Grissom. They go check out Zoe&rsquo;s apartment and find that she&rsquo;s still interested in psychology. Zoe had also been to the Betz Clinic, who said she was there for chronic insomnia. Both Zoe and Capt. Jack were in the same test group, and both left the study part way through the night.</p>

<p>Lady Heather confirms the body is Zoe&rsquo;s, and even though she is torn up, Gil questions her about Zoe. About a year ago, Zoe had dropped out of Harvard and stopped talking to her mother, though Lady Heather didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate.</p>

<p>Results show that Zoe had <em>eaten</em> her own hand off, and the CSIs sweep the desert for her hand. Instead they found the house of Jacob Wolfwitz (from the Clinic), who happens to have a variety of genetically modified plants, including ones that smell like decomposing bodies. When they go to the door, however, it&rsquo;s Lady Heather who enters, having broken in. She explains to Grissom that she was hoping Wolfwitz would invite the cops in and they would find something probative. Instead, he dismisses the charges (never knowing it&rsquo;s Lady Heather or Zoe&rsquo;s mother), and Lady Heather whips out a manuscript she stole from his house, saying it was too expensive and must have been stolen.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the manuscript was stolen from the UNLV library, which is enough to get a warrent. Before they can act on it, Wolfwitz is found dead in his car, having been frozen solid at least two days before.</p>

<p>This sets everyone on edge, as the day before Catherine had interviewed Wolfwitz, and the evening before, Lady heather had slept with him. As she explains to Grissom, she needed a sample of his DNA for the CSIs. She also explains that Zoe had left Harvard because she&rsquo;d gotten pregnant with her therapist&rsquo;s child. As he was married and a doctor, Lady Heather had his license revoked, which was when Lady Heather and Zoe stopped speaking.</p>

<p>The dirt/mulch at Wolfwitz&rsquo;s house had the DNA of almost 20 different people, including Zoe, and the DNA from the condom (from Lady Heather) matched DNA on the UNLV book. His car, however, had the fingerprints of a Leon Sneller: Wolfwitz&rsquo;s twin. The boys had been adopted by a Jewish couple and Jacob had inherited the house. Leon, on the other hand, had rejected this and become a Nazi. The CSI&rsquo;s find a WWII era laboratory under the house, where Sneller performed his Mengele-esque experiments (including a siamese twins experiment, currently going on in one room, though neither twin lived after the CSIs rescued them). Zoe had been selected for her eyes: one was blue, the other brown.</p>

<p>The CSIs are unable to find Sneller until Grissom notices Lady heather&rsquo;s necklace under a couch. He drives out to where Zoe&rsquo;s body was found, and comes across Lady Heather and Sneller. She tied him to the front of his car and whipped him over and over again. Grissom stops her and Lady Heather breaks down sobbing.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:dd8bc1f91417debc4ec3a7c33fff9766">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In a twist to the normal CSI format, this episode was told from two perspectives: that of the CSIs and that of the killers.</p>

<p>Karl &lsquo;Red&rsquo; Cooper is a former bank robber and thief who served time when his former friend, Clayton Nash, finked on him and a bunch of their fellow criminals. Karl shoots and kills Clayton in retribution, after Nash contacts him as a part of the 12-step process to cure one&rsquo;s self of dependency. As Karl makes his escape, meticulous enough to not even leave a stray cigarette butt, he is broadsided by a drunk young woman named Ally Sullivan. Hoping to avoid the police, Karl tries to talk Ally out of calling them, but she does so anyway. Or at least she starts to, when Karl breaks her neck, leaving her for dead.</p>

<p>Back at home, Karl shaves his beard and tries to keep it secret from his wife, Janice, who knows of his bank robber past and the reason he served time. Karl follows the case of Ally via the television and feels some measure of guilt for the death of an innocent. He goes so far as to leave cash for Ally&rsquo;s father, by way of apology. When he feels the CSIs are getting close, Karl asks his lawyer (who is a lawyer for many former and current criminals) for supplies from which Karl can forge a new identity. Janice finds these and confronts Karl, who admits to killing Nash. While Janice understands the killing of Nash, she is horrified that Karl killed Ally and kicks him out. The next day, the CSIs come to Janice&rsquo;s home and threaten to take away their daughter. Upon finding this out, Karl turns himself in.</p>

<p>As for the CSIs, they appear to play catch-up for much of the case. They have little evidence, and it&rsquo;s not until they find matching fibers on Ally and Nash that they&rsquo;re able to link the cases and determine the killer. The car leads them to a used car lot where a blurry photocopy of Karl is their only lead. Checking the bus routes, they find the bus driver who recognizes Karl, and gives the stop he boarded the bus from. That stop turns out to be on an ATV route, where the CSIs find a burnt pile of clothes, including the gloves which left fibers at Ally and Nash&rsquo;s crime scene. The ATV tracks are particular enough to lead the CSIs to Janice. Also, the palm print Karl left on Ally&rsquo;s car links them to him, and the same last name between Janice and Karl is enough for a warrant, especially since Karl&rsquo;s record lists Janice, under her maiden name, as a visitor in prison.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:dd8bc1f91417debc4ec3a7c33fff9766">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>There is very little character development in this episode, as the majority of the story is told from Karl&rsquo;s perspective. Sara&rsquo;s best work comes when she tracks the bus routes that may have taken Karl to where he bought the car, which turns up a very attentive bus driver.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:a1bf0e53c89e08026ea8364846a69be8">Synopsis</h2>

<p>At her birthday party, Lois O&rsquo;Neill, a former Vegas show girl and ex of one of Vegas&rsquo; founders, is having a bash. Dancing with handsome men and dolling out advice to the younger set. So it&rsquo;s surprising when one of her waiters, Tim Duke, is found dead by her assistant later that night and Lois is nowhere to be seen. When the assistant, Eve Girard, is asked to open the closet/safe, Lois is found cowering within, and evidence points to her being shot at as she went to hide.</p>

<p>Lois admits she often comes up to change during parties (one dress for greeting, one for diner and dancing, and one for desert). She&rsquo;d offered Tim the job because he needed the money. When she came up to change, someone shot him and tried to shoot her, so she locked herself in the closet. Lois claims she&rsquo;s a suspect because of the tell-all book she wrote. Greg is smitten and asks for her autograph. Lois&rsquo; driver, Bob Jensen, used to drive for her boyfriend, Tony C. (who vanished ala Jimmy Hoffa), refuses to talk about anything.</p>

<p>Sara and David Phillips check out the body. Two shots and a lot of money in his pocket, as well as an empty crack vial. Sara goes to tell Catherine, who explains that her mother was a back-up dancer for Lois. Nick collects the security cameras and information about all the people at the party, which includes the Sheriff and Sam Braun, Catherine&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>In attendance also is pop star Li&rsquo;l Cherry, who left the room when the killing happened. The Sheriff orders Grissom to let everyone who <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> leave the room to be let go. Cherry makes a scene and tries to run off before grissom can search her bag. Of course they do and find a crack pipe. At the interrogation, the point out that the victim had a crack pipe, and so did Cherry. Cherry denies involvement with the shooting.</p>

<p>Sara and Greg find millions in cash under the floor. Lois says she didn&rsquo;t know it was there, but Eve says she knew about it. The coroner determines that Tim was shot and killed by a bullet through the heart, dying instantly, and then shot again ten minutes later in the head, contrary to what Lois said.</p>

<p>Sara, Greg and Warrick discuss possibilities for the murder of ex boxer and petty thief, Tim Duke. Greg speculates the money is stolen from a &lsquo;famous&rsquo; Pan-Am heist in 1965, and that Tony C. left the money for Lois. One possibility for the murder is that he was a hit man, hired to kill Lois. Another is that Tony hired Tim to protect Lois because of the book. A third is that Lois herself was the killer. Catherine and Sara go to check her dinner dress for GSR but the dress is missing. Sara finds the ring instead and it is, indeed, positive for GSR, and the gun used to kill Tim matches the one from the Pan-Am flight.</p>

<p>When Brass and Grissom go to check on Lois about the mater, they find her dead, shot in her own bed. Lois was already dying of tumors, and Bob confesses the rest. Lois had tried to cover up Tim&rsquo;s death. She&rsquo;d hired him to plan this last bash and then kill her, so she could die pretty at the party, instead of a dried up old bag in the hospital. But Tim had tried to steal from her, and she shot him with Tony&rsquo;s gun, the same gun he&rsquo;d used to steal from Pan-Am years ago. With Tim dead, Lois asked Bob to kill her so she could die with a little dignity.</p>

<p>Sara is highly amused by Greg&rsquo;s obsession with Lois and her history. She&rsquo;s only spot on the mark, picking out the ring after she and Catherine find the dress is missing.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two Daddy&rsquo;s girls pay high prices when their worlds invite murder and mayhem.</p>

<p>Bianca Desmond, daughter of &lsquo;Gas &amp; Sip&rsquo; king, Happy Harry Desmond, lives with her boyfriend Ahren, who is found dead in her garage after a night of partying with Bianca and Chelsea Wannamaker. Bianca demonstrates a bit of a cleaning jag, prompting the CSIs to suspect she&rsquo;s a speed freak. Chelsea claims they only use drugs recreationally. A drop of blood was found in the bedroom, but it doesn&rsquo;t match Ahren or Bianca, and a bullet is found in a soda can in the garage.</p>

<p>The blood <em>does</em> match Justin Cole, a meth-using ex of Bianca&rsquo;s. He finds it funny that Ahren was shot at, because he too was shot in the knee and chased away from Bianca. The soda-can bullet happens to match one found in the knee of Bianca&rsquo;s meth-head ex-boyfriend. Since it looks like Ahren fought back, the CSIs determine he managed to avoid the gun, only to be stabbed in the femoral artery, bleeding out in minutes. The bullet, however, is copper, and doesn&rsquo;t help with matching it to anything on a database. The garage is well organized, and Warrick finds one screwdriver that doesn&rsquo;t match anything. The screwdriver belongs to Tom Harper, who installed DSL and provides the work order.</p>

<p>The main shocker is that Chelsea is Bianca&rsquo;s mother and Happy Harry her father. Chelsea had slept with Ahren and Bianca had found out, but the couple had made up and decided to move to Colorado. Harry, on the other hand, is surprised to find that Chelsea was cheating on him, with Ahren. All of Harry&rsquo;s guns are checked and none match. Chelsea has a gun, but claims it had been stolen earlier that month.</p>

<p>When the CSIs go to talk to Bianca about guns, they find her bloddied and beaten in her home. At the ER, after Sara chases out Bianca&rsquo;s parents, Bianca says Sara shouldn&rsquo;t have taken away her father&rsquo;s innocence, regarding her mother&rsquo;s infidelity. Sara says that whomever beat up Bianca is the killer, and Bianca should stop trying to protect her family. But Bianca won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The CSIs review the evidence. The substance found on Bianca&rsquo;s neck (in the ER) is found on railroad ties and telephones poles. Tom Harper&rsquo;s DSL work order was for a Sunday. Sara tests the paper and determines the order has been counterfeited. This leads her to examine phone records and find that Bianca had some serious overlap with her three boyfriends: Tom, Justin, and Ahren.</p>

<p>In an interview, Tom admits that he had been tapping Bianca&rsquo;s phone line, to keep an eye on her and protect her. He also says that Chelsea had asked him to scare off Justin. Tom tried to scare off Ahren when he overheard Bianca telling her father she wanted to moved to Colorado with Ahren. Only the shot went wide, and when Tom kicked at Ahren&rsquo;s groin, his pole-climbing spike punctured Ahren&rsquo;s aterey. Both he and Chelsea are charged with murder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Catherine and Nick work a case that harkens back to Walter Gordon (from &ldquo;Grave Danger&rdquo;), the man who buried Nick alive. Accountant Sylvia Mullins is killed by her own car, pinned against the wall. The security guard had been asleep, and the camera had been turned out of focus an hour before. This sets the crime as a homicide, and no simple hit-and-run. While going through Sylvia&rsquo;s belongings, Nick finds that she was working with Kelly Gordon, Walter&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Nick interviews Kelly, and determines that Sylvia was the trustee to Walter&rsquo;s estate. He accuses her of murder, and she claims innocence. As Nick reviews the case, he finds the new evidence Grissom logged in &ldquo;Bodies in Motion&rdquo;. Nick confronts Archie on the evidence, and though angry, asks Archie to see if Kelly is the second voice on the tape. It turns out the voice is Sylvia&rsquo;s. Also, the hand that unfocused the security camera was Kelly&rsquo;s and Sylvia was possibly embezzling from her clients.</p>

<p>Kelly Gordon is arrested and confesses. She killed Sylvia because the ransom plot was Sylvia&rsquo;s idea. Sylvia had also taken the money from the Gordon estate. As the episode ends, Kelly is ODing on handfuls of meds, and her death is uncertain though likely.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>After talking to Bianca in the ER, Sara notices the substance on her skin and snaps up the nurse&rsquo;s gloves. It&rsquo;s this evidence that leads them to look at Tom closer and eventually find the killer. While Sara is more subdued than normal with an abuse case, she still shows her strong distaste in those situations.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:8a1a57c8addeb92bb3b0c62f628de41a">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara still reacts strongly to rape and abuse cases, where women are victimized.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(looking at Grissom)</em> I guess some people just shouldn&rsquo;t be together.</p>
