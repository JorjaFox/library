<h2 id="synopsis:876d1256dfe6fb4bb5021cab8cfff84e">Synopsis</h2>

<p>As the weather breaks 110+ in Las Vegas, deaths are more common but less common place. A homeless man dies in an alley, a married couple are killed in a seedy hotel room, and a bee dies in mid-flight.</p>

<p>The couple in the hotel room were killed by their 12 year-old daughter, who they thought was possessed by a devil, and kept her locked in an attic room much of the time. After hiring a local minister who specialized in exorcism, the father had second thoughts and freed his daughter, who hooked up with an older man she&rsquo;d met online. After having sex with him, she killed her parents and her younger sister. The minister, who earlier had been preaching to the poor masses of Las Vegas that they were in hell, finds the 12 year-old and throws her off a balcony, killing her and completing the exorcism.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:876d1256dfe6fb4bb5021cab8cfff84e">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara works the case of the dead homeless man, who died after getting in a fight with another bum over a sandwich, and was briefly detained by the police. Sara questions the police officer involved, who says he didn&rsquo;t bring the man in because he thought it was a ploy by the homeless man to get some AC in the heat. Sadly, the man died of exposure.</p>

<p>Working the swing shift, Sara&rsquo;s new partner is the rookie, Ronnie Lake, who annoys Sara with endless questions, very few of which are pertinent to the case. The questions prompt Sara to institute a 20 questions a case rule. Sara cracks down on the rookie when she wonders if it&rsquo;s right to consider the police as suspects. Sara also misses her friends on the night shift, and is very pleased to talk to Brass and Greg when she sees them.</p>

<p>Once Sara is off the clock, she goes and visits Grissom at his crime scene, where he&rsquo;s stealing bees (with permission). She comments on something she read about the deaths of bees, and Grissom corrects her. At this point, Sara is still wearing a sling, but no large (or visible) cast, and most of her facial injuries have healed.</p>

<p><strong>Lake</strong> Oh, you&rsquo;re not seriously going to go after the cops over something like this.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You know, I&rsquo;m going to answer that question. We&rsquo;re not here to protect anyone Ronnie, not even cops. We&rsquo;re here to figure out what happened. If you can&rsquo;t do that, you should get a different job.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:7bcf208ec98b3c8564e9e6085a945757">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The CSIs work two cases, one of a high school student, Vincent Bartley, whose head is found along side the road, and the other of a rich pornographer, Huxley, found dead in a blind eatery. Vinnie was a Go-Kart enthusiast who&rsquo;d lost his head in a race on the streets, getting it and his hand severed by a blown out truck tire. Huxley was killed out of a waiter&rsquo;s revenge on the restaurant&rsquo;s chef, who had made her living off his ideas and their past relationship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Grissom and Sara are under review for their relationship, which is in violation of lab policy. Grissom dodges the review for most of the day. The other CSIs discuss Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s relationship during their cases.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:7bcf208ec98b3c8564e9e6085a945757">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara returns to the lab to have her review with Conrad Ecklie. Having a relationship with another member of the team is in violation of policy. Ecklie asks when Grissom and Sara first began their relationship, to which Sara points out they&rsquo;ve always had a relationship. She claims they became intimate two years ago, on a Sunday.</p>

<p>Grissom, however, states they first &hellip;you know_&rsquo;d nine years ago, prompting Ecklie to tell Grissom they needed to get their stories straight. The two met nine years ago at a Forensics Academy Conference, where Sara wore her hair in a ponytail and asked too many questions about anthropology, while trying to get up the nerve to ask Grissom out to dinner.</p>

<p>In the end, Sara moves to the Swing shift, so she&rsquo;s no longer under Grissom&rsquo;s supervision. While Grissom had planned to do so, Sara didn&rsquo;t want the rest of the team to suffer. They go, together, to the Go Kart track, and Grissom races with the other CSIs. The episode ends as Sara stands alone, separated from the Night shift team.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:b7821b86e2872049af40eb61181cdf20">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The miniature serial killer, Natalie Davis, kidnapped Sara  and left her in the desert, trapped under a car. While the CSIs try to determine how Natalie kidnapped her and where Sara might be, three thunderstorms converge on the Las Vegas area, promising flash floods.</p>

<p>Through flashbacks, the story of Sara&rsquo;s kidnapping and the perils she faced in the desert are told, intercut with her teammates hunt for her and with all the CSIs remembering past cases where they worked with Sara. The stories interweave until the car is found in the dry desert, the morning after Sara&rsquo;s abduction, without Sara underneath.</p>

<p>Nick finds Sara&rsquo;s CSI vest, proving she got out from under the car, and Grissom found Sara&rsquo;s footprints, leading away from the car. Following Sara&rsquo;s trail, they find a dead body in the desert, but it&rsquo;s not Sara&rsquo;s. Nick finds Sara, within sight of the road, unconscious. The EMTs arrive moments later, and while Sara appears to be alive, she has no radial pulse. Grissom rides with Sara to the ER in the helicopter.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:b7821b86e2872049af40eb61181cdf20">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara had gone to the mall to get food from a vegetarian restaurant, and was in the parking lot when Grissom called to tell her about Natalie Davis. As Sara was putting her things in the trunk, Natalie stepped out and stunned her with a Tazer, and locked Sara in the back of her own trunk. Sara woke up in the back of the car and removed the Tazer needle from her vest in order to cut the plastic restraints holding her hands.</p>

<p>Once free, Sara peeked out the back of the trunk before breaking out of the trunk and grabbing Natalie as she was driving the car. Sara&rsquo;s actions caused Natalie to loose control of the car and, in the scuffle, Sara was tossed out of the car. Natalie retrieved Sara and tied her back up again in the back-seat, waking her up with some water. Sara talks to Natalie, trying to bond over their shared experiences in foster homes and lost fathers.</p>

<p>The water was drugged, however, and Sara passed out shortly after realizing that Natalie was doing this because of Grissom. When Sara woke up, she was in the desert and Natalie was lowering the upside-down red Mustang onto Sara. Natalie drove off, and as Sara lay trapped, coyotes approached. They did little more than sniff at her before the thunderstorms started and drove them off.</p>

<p>While trapped under the car, with the water rising, Sara struggled to get free. Her trapped arm prevented her from doing so, while also preventing her from keeping her head above water. In trying to escape, Sara broke the rear-view mirror of the car, using it as a lever to free her arm and then free herself from the car. Hiking in the desert, Sara used her shirt as a bandana and sling, and make her way to the safety of the rocks, where she was able to see how far from civilization she was.</p>

<p>Leaving little cairns along her way, Sara continued to hike in the 110 heat, keeping herself awake by doing multiplication in her head. The trials of the day prove to be too much, and Sara passes out, only fifty yards from the road. Nick spots the reflections from the mirror, and Sara is taken by helicopter to the ER.</p>

<p>Sara wakes up in the helicopter with Grissom smiling at her, and she returns the look.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:b7821b86e2872049af40eb61181cdf20">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara doesn&rsquo;t like car trunks, because in her line of work, you only find corpses in them.<br /></li>
<li>Sara knew that Natalie was a cleaning person at the lab, and recognized her.<br /></li>
<li>Sara calls Grissom by his first name for the first time.<br /></li>
<li>Even bruised, battered and drugged, Sara kept her wits and determined while Natalie kidnapped her.<br /></li>
<li>When cornered, Sara fights back.<br /></li>
<li>Sara eats at the veggie place in the mall 2 or 3 times a week.<br /></li>
<li>When Sara tells Natalie about her foster experience, she says that she was all alone &ndash; no mention of an older brother.<br /></li>

<h2 id="synopsis:4af1627ec4cac105241e997a079bcd3f">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The miniature serial killer is revealed to be Natalie Davis, foster daughter to Ernie Dell , who has an aversion to bleach. Having killed some of her foster siblings, including Trevor just 12 days ago, she caps her crime spree by abducting and trapping Sara under a car.</p>

<p>Natalie&rsquo;s story is told with many flashbacks to how she got the job cleaning the CSI lab, as well as that Ernie knew she was killing. Natalie&rsquo;s issues with bleach began when she killed her birth sister, shoving her out of their tree house, and her father cleaned up the blood with bleach. Unable to care for her, he gave Natalie up to social services. Having seen both Grissom&rsquo;s miniature and his affection for Sara, Natalie makes Sara her final victim as payback. Because Natalie blames Grissom for Ernie&rsquo;s death, and Ernie was the only person who she ever loved, Natalie tries to make Grissom suffer like she did.</p>

<p>She leaves a miniature of Sara, trapped under a car, but still moving, in Grissom&rsquo;s office. After Natalie is brought in for questioning, she refuses to tell Grissom where Sara is.</p>
