<h2 id="synopsis:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Solving the case of wealthy defense attorney Diane Chase &ndash; killed at her son&rsquo;s wedding &ndash; is compromised when all of the evidence from the case is stolen along with Nick&rsquo;s car, while he, Greg and Sara are having breakfast at their traditional restaurant (the same as seen in &ldquo;The Strip Strangler&rdquo; back in season one).</p>

<p>Confined to the lab until Internal Affairs arrives, and without the evidence, the three reconstruct the case from their memories and the videographer&rsquo;s DVD of the event. They initially assume that whomever stole the car also killed Diane, however it was really the bridesmaids, acting in cahoots, who accidently killed Diane and covered it up. By the time Internal Affairs arrives to take their statements, the case has been solved, and the criminals confessed.</p>

<p>Much of the episode is told via flashbacks, and everyone&rsquo;s version of the event has a different feel. Sara&rsquo;s seems to be anti-wedding, while Nick embraces the sappier side of marriage. Grissom and Brass are very cut and dried, but Greg is a nearly over-the-top film noir. The name of the episode is a play on the movie, Rashomon, which revolves around the issue that, due to differeing witness accounts, it can be impossible to discern the truth.</p>

<p>At the end of the episode, Grissom states that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which one of them Internal Affairs speaks with first, as their stories will all be the same.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>There is a duality to Sara in this episode &ndash; she goes from pessimistic and negative (voicing her opposition to tradition, her commentary on marriage) to humorous and cheerful (the guy flirting with her, comments to Nick). She doesn&rsquo;t like people who blindly follow traditions &ndash; demonstrating some &lsquo;Grissom-esque&rsquo; recall on the subject of marriage &ndash; but she also says that she&rsquo;s not anti-wedding. While waiting for IAB, she takes a nap in the locker room (face down on the bench), and is enthusiastic when Catherine wakes her to process the car. Despite the situation &ndash; stolen evidence and an IAB investigation &ndash; she doesn&rsquo;t let herself get frustrated.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara (and Greg) maxed out on overtime.<br /></li>
<li>Sara is not anti-wedding, but anti-stupid. She dislikes people following traditions merely for the sake of tradition.<br /></li>
<li>Sara actually knows about the history of weddings, including the fact that bridesmaids dressed like the bride to confuse evil spirits.<br /></li>
<li>As has been noted before, Sara doesn&rsquo;t mind when guys flirt with her, even if it is a drunken guy at the reception; she takes it all in stride and may appreciate the attention.<br /></li>
<li>Sara is familiar with author Raymond Chandler&rsquo;s work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:f522ef30cca09bc1fd3fed8774816c39">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(holding up lingerie against herself for size)</em> Just in time. I need your hands.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> I thought you&rsquo;d never ask.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I need you to reprint the bumper, since the tape lifts were stolen.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Oh.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Ah tradition, like becoming property exchanged between your father and your husband.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(voiceover)</em> Can the love be real when the flowers aren&rsquo;t?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Stokes:</strong> Should I write down flirting?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I was printing. <em>He</em> was flirting.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(waking up from nap in locker room)</em> Finally. Something to process.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I&rsquo;m not anti-wedding, I&rsquo;m just anti-stupid.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:de9f7aca2bf0b94571d05fca9fe6abba">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Three members of a rap artist Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team are found dead after attempting to hang posters of rival rapper, Dollar, in a bikini and a &lsquo;Dude&rsquo;s Gone Wild&rsquo; pose. The poster was made off a video taken while Dollar was held at gunpoint, which was orchestrated by one of Dollar&rsquo;s own street team; Dante. Dante had only joined up to get close to Dollar. His sister, Trish, had been in a &lsquo;Girls Gone Nuts&rsquo; video, made by Dollar, and when their father saw it, beat Trish nearly to death.</p>

<p>The video was then sent to Hi-Def&rsquo;s right-hand woman, J-Lady, who possibly let it spread all over the internet. Three kids from Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team went to poster unflattering pictures from the tape over Vegas, and the posters were seen by a member of Dollar&rsquo;s street team. Another member, Morris, worshiped Dollar, and took the gun his older brother had stolen, and gunned down Hi-Def&rsquo;s street team, killing all three members.</p>

<p>The driver of the car confessed to running over one of the kids, and fingered the shooter, Morris. Dante was also in the car at the time of the murders, and confessed to having set Dollar up.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:23c9d584604770b385c8d701c82851f5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Grissom and his team investigate the case of psychic Sedona Wiley who envisioned her own death. During a &lsquo;reading&rsquo; with two young women (Anah Leah and Lori from Evaluation Day), the psychic begins to see visions of her own murder instead of information pertaining to her clients. When she is later found dead in her occult shop, it is up to the CSI team to determine her true cause of death. Greg, who reveals to Grissom that an expertise in the &lsquo;occult&rsquo; runs in his family, suspects greater forces may be responsible for the woman&rsquo;s demise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a retired cop who used the psychic for help on a 15 year old case of Claire Wallace, believes the suspect in his cold case is the killer. Brass and Grissom agree to reopen the case, and discover the psychic used extortion with other people. Following the psychic&rsquo;s advice, they uncover the body of the long dead wife from the cold case, and subsequently determine that Claire&rsquo;s husband, Gordon, did in deed kill Sedona, believing that she had psychically uncovered that he had killed his wife.</p>

<p>Grissom, who has steadfastly maintained that science will always crack the case in the end, shows Greg Sedona&rsquo;s &lsquo;death&rsquo; book, in which she has written generic phrases to use when speaking of the dead. One of those phrases clued the retired cop into where he should be looking, but only by the power of suggestion..</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:0a763d240719aa832c6a7f84bccfb62f">Synopsis</h2>

<p>17 year-old Stacy was found wrapped in a shower curtain, in her school&rsquo;s flower bed, having last been seen alone at tennis practice. Marlon West, her classmate, is accused of her murder, based on the evidence of Stacy&rsquo;s hair in his shower and sink drains. However, on the stand it is his 12 year-old sister, Hannah, who confesses to the crime.</p>

<p>What is known is that there were fake &lsquo;out of order&rsquo; signs in the girls&rsquo; locker room, and the only non-labeled showerhead was packed with sodium, so that it exploded when Stacy used it. The explosion was big enough to cut Stacy, and she grabbed the shower curtain and ran off. In her panic, she fell down a flight of stairs and cracked her head open. The body was dragged to the flower bed, and Stacy&rsquo;s car was left outside her boyfriend house, Scott Baird.</p>

<p>In an earlier confessional, Marlon explained that he hated Stacy, though everyone else at the school adored her. Hannah also disliked Stacy, mostly because Stacy harassed Hannah, who threw off the grading curve. Stacy pranked Hannah a couple times, before enlisting Scott to encourage Hannah to come to the Spring Formal and give her a dress from Stacy. At the dance, wearing the dress, the words &lsquo;FLAT&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rainbow Party!&rsquo; were written in ink that only showed up under the black light of the dance. Pictures were taken and Hannah was embarrassed on [<a href="http://www.myspace.com">http://www.myspace.com</a> MySpace].</p>

<p>The blood found on Hannah&rsquo;s shirt was her own, but the soil matched the flower garden. Nick and Sara explore the house while Sofia talks to the parents. The parents obviously prefer Hannah, to the point they ignore her brother. The siblings share the bathroom where Stacy&rsquo;s hair was found, and while Marlon&rsquo;s room has no evidence, Hannah&rsquo;s has her award winning science fair project on elemental sodium.</p>

<p>While Hannah&rsquo;s prints are on the shower curtain, Scott&rsquo;s bloody prints are found on the car. The bloody prints were left over from Scott and Stacy&rsquo;s first sexual experience; he&rsquo;d wiped his hands under the seat.</p>

<p>Using Warrick&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s niece, he Nick and Sara test the crime and determine it&rsquo;s most likely the siblings committed it together, as Stacy would be too heavy for Hannah to drag. But Hannah claims to have used a cart to move the body, while Marlon sticks to his story. A pizza order to the West house at 9 P.M. (Stacy&rsquo;s time of death), exonerates one of the two, but the delivery boy can&rsquo;t remember which one answered the door.</p>

<p>The DA goes ahead with prosecuting Marlon, as Nick and Ecklie think he did it, and only Sara thinks it was Hannah. Marlon is found not guilty, and when he&rsquo;s checked out of jail, Hannah and Sara talk. Sara&rsquo;s worried about what will happen to Hannah, and Hannah says that no one cares about Marlon and how she can write a book about all this. Then she marvels at how people can see things that were never there, and confides to Sara: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill Stacy, Marlon did.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Sara:</strong> <em>(reading what was written on Hannah&rsquo;s dress)</em> Rainbow party?<br />
<strong>Nick:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s a party game where the boys get the girls to wear different colored lip sticks while they have oral sex. The boy with the most colors wins. It&rsquo;s supposed to be trendy.<br />
<strong>Sara:</strong> So much for spin the bottle.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:d2a882b41024b67f882cdbd2ef55755b">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The forensics reality show <em>Hard Crime</em> follows the CSIs as they work on the rape case of Christina Hollis. Raped in the very condo building she worked and lived in, Christina had been tied to her bed by duct tape and assaulted by Richard McQueen, a man posing as a fireman. The rapist&rsquo;s MO was to light smoke bombs in the building, knock on the door of a woman, knock her out with the lorazepam and to rape her over hours, multiple times. Additionally, Richard had a foot fetish.</p>

<p>At some point during the rape, Christina&rsquo;s quasi-boyfriend came by with flowers, but when he found the door was locked and heard Barry White playing, he assumed she&rsquo;d moved on and threw the flowers down in a huff.<br />
Christina was unable to remember a great number of details, but said she didn&rsquo;t paint her nails, which were currently painted ruby red.</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s via the trace evidence of a scrap of cloth from Richard&rsquo;s fireman uniform that the CSIs can pin the disguise down. But the outfit isn&rsquo;t a perfect match to the materials used by the Las Vegas Fire Department, and quickly it&rsquo;s determined the fake-fireman is also the same man who set smoke bombs in another apartment building. As it turns out, that was a smoke test, as Richard was seeing how well his disguise worked. His first &lsquo;attack&rsquo; had been on a woman whom he&rsquo;d spied from his balcony, doing yoga on her own balcony. A month previously, he&rsquo;d met her at a bar, drugged her, took her home and given her a pedicure.</p>

<p>In Richard&rsquo;s apartment, all the evidence needed to pin him to the crimes was there, except Ricard. He was busy setting the smoke bombs for his next victim. The fourth and final victim he killed, because she wouldn&rsquo;t let him touch her feet. The real firemen caught Richard trying to flee, and proceeded to beat the shit out of him.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:d2a882b41024b67f882cdbd2ef55755b">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that Sara has a strong dislike to rape. When asked if her following a lead on a cold case is as helpful as another rape victim, in terms of finding evidence, Sara says she&rsquo;d rather it not come to that.</p>
