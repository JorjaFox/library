<h2 id="synopsis:bd041d9138d3294e3a7e41202040e1e2">Synopsis</h2>

<p>An anonymous phone call informs 911 that a man is dead in his house. When the CSIs arrive, they find a dead Hayden Bradford, who puts new meaning to the term hirsute. Hayden had Hypertrichosis, and was killed via a silver bullet through the heart.</p>

<p>Warrick and Sara explore the inside of the house and find that a woman named Michelle (who had called Hayden 6 times that night) was in pictures and appeared to be his girlfriend. Also, casinodan@gmail.com had sent threatening emails to Dan about a debt. Outside, Catherine and Nick find a broken window, a rock with a print, and a buried gun.</p>

<p>At the lab, Archie traces down Casino Dan, and when Warrick and Greg interview him, he claims that Hayden had lost $10,000 on Dan&rsquo;s poker site. Hayden claimed credit card fraud when he started loosing and stuck Dan with the bill. After Dan leaves, Warrick notices the trace from his shoes seems to resemble that from the crime scene.</p>

<p>The print from the rock belongs to a man named Brent, who claims to be Hayden&rsquo;s best friend and Michelle&rsquo;s brother. When Michelle is eventually tracked down, she was brokenhearted.</p>

<p>Sofia and Sara check out the phone booth where the 911 call was made from, though Sofia arrives first and prints the booth without Sara. Sofia also points out the large quantity of hair that seems to have been &lsquo;shedded&rsquo; on the ground. Sara takes this to the lab, where the hair is determined to be that of Hayden&rsquo;s twin sister, Allison. That said, there is no paper trail at all for Alison.</p>

<p>Back at the house, Catherine finds a secret room in the house where the sister lives. Allison has been hiding in her room for years, never coming out and never talking to people. Her father ran off years ago and the mother was dead. When Hayden was shot, she&rsquo;d been hiding in her room, and only came out at midnight to call the police, in the hopes they wouldn&rsquo;t find her.</p>

<p>Grissom feels bad for Allison, sympathizing with her desire not to be seen as a freak. Nick agrees, and says that Hayden was looking for their mom, who wasn&rsquo;t dead but left them when the twins were teenagers. The mother comes to the station and tells Grissom that she realized she had to leave so that Allison wouldn&rsquo;t always depend on her, and so she faked her death. Now it was too late to go back.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Casino Dan&rsquo;s trace connects him to the crime scene. He admits he came by to hassle Hayden about the money, but only looked in the window. When Dan saw Hayden (and Hayden saw Dan), he freaked out and ran off because Hayden was a freak.</p>

<p>The autopsy (which takes a long time, becuase all of Hayden&rsquo;s hair had to be shaved off first) suggests Hayden was killed in Allison&rsquo;s room. A check of her room finds blood stains under the bed. Allison confesses that Hayden had actually been shot in her room: he&rsquo;d come in, asked for her gun (which she&rsquo;d buried outside) and then been shot. Allison saw the face of Hayden&rsquo;s killer reflected in her TV: Brent.</p>

<p>Brent confesses to the murder, saying that his family blamed him for Hayden and Michelle being engaged, and he did it all to protect Michelle. Michelle admits she suspected Brent had killed Hayden, but he&rsquo;d threatened her to keep her quiet.</p>

<p>In the end, Allison has enough money to take care of herself, but tells Catherine her greatest secret. Allison knew her mother was never dead.</p>

<p>The episode ends with Mrs. Bradford knocking on the door to Allison&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Sara&rsquo;s most interesting scene is when she meets Sofia by the phone booth. Sofia is irritable and pushy and angry, while Sara is mild and calm. The disparity between the characters shows a depth of calm that Sara didn&rsquo;t always have. Sara doesn&rsquo;t comment about Sofia tampering with evidence at the scene (processing when she shouldn&rsquo;t have been).</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:72c8e5d1b542b06cc5ab6309513187fa">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Karen Matthews, a widow to a soldier who died in Afghanistan, reports her son, 6 year-old Jesse, has gone missing from a playground. Other parents at the park report they saw a boy looking like Jesse being watched by a white male with a 51&rsquo;s baseball cap, as does a necropheliac who saw the boy in the restroom.</p>

<p>When Jesse is found in the company of the man and his wife, his DNA matches theirs and he refers to them as his parents. Jesse is actually Adam Esposito. Karen had taken photos from the Esposito family website and photoshopped Adam into pictures with her, essentially stalking the family. However, DNA taken from Karen&rsquo;s house shows that there is a Jesse, and he is missing. Karen herself is more than a little crazy, claiming that Catherine saw Jesse at Karen&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>The CSIs determine no one has actually seen Jesse in four years, not since the funeral of Karen&rsquo;s husband, Dwight. Now working a 4 year-old cold case, the CSIs assume the worst: that Jesse is dead. Investigating Karen&rsquo;s house, they find heavy duty anti-psychotics with a four year-old prescription. Opposing Karen&rsquo;s claim that Jesse was home schooled, Grissom determines it was Karen who did the finger-painting and other messes caused by &lsquo;Jesse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The CSIs find traces of a body, but not the body itself, in the backyard, and conclude that Karen must have moved the body. Based on testimony from her neighbor, they suspect that the neighbor&rsquo;s dog smelled the body and tried to dig it up, for which Karen killed it (or so claimed the dog&rsquo;s owner). Then she moved Jesse&rsquo;s body to protect it. On the basis of the drugs found in the soil where Jesse <em>had</em> been buried, they infer that Karen gave Jesse her drugs after the funeral, killing him.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, Karen is undeniably insane. While she is guilty of filicide, it is unlikely Karen will face trial. As the episode ends, Karen imagines she sees her son, running to her.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:ada2fbbda8fbcb9a138fff362b3449ec">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Grissom and Catherine confront a case of a man with [<a href="http://www.pwsausa.org/">http://www.pwsausa.org/</a> Prader-Willi Syndrome] who literally ate himself to death. Jerry Gable required constant supervision all his life, or he would eat non-stop. He lived with his sister, but when she went to the hospital for surgery, she left her boyfriend to watch Jerry. Jerry manipulated the boyfriend to take him to a buffet, where he chowed down at the buffet itself and was kicked out. The boyfriend hatched a plan to enter Jerry in an extreme eating contest, which Jerry came in third. But Jerry was still hungry and ran off, eventually eating himself to death.</p>

<p>Nick and Sara watch a divorce end with the death of both parties. Michael and Lori Tinsley fought over everything, from the house and the vinyl collection, to their dog Kahlua. Finally they agree to let the dog decide, and in the presence of a lawyer, both call the dog to them. Kahula chose Lori, however she cheated by rubbing bacon on her hands. Michael came back that night to swap out the real Kahula with a look-alike he&rsquo;d bought at the shelter. Lori was home and confronted him, shooting him bizzarely up the nostril with her .22 caliber. The faux-Kahula was likely abused, and the loud noise set her off, causing her to rip out Lori&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>Sara and Nick are both sharp cookies on this case. While Nick follows the blood drops, Sara investigates the missing vinyl selection. Both determine that the missing albums, between the Beach Boys and Billy Joel can only be [<a href="http://www.beatles.com/">http://www.beatles.com/</a> The Beatles].</p>

<p>After learning Michael was shot (there was no blood on the scene or an exit wound, the .22 lodged in his brain), Sara returns to the Tinsley House and deduces the gun was thrown when the dog attacked Lori. With little work, she finds it under the couch.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In the conclusion of &ldquo;A Bullet Runs Through It (Part 1)&rdquo;, the detectives and CSI follow the questions of who shot officer Bell, who shot the young boy on his bicycle, and why would a car open fire on a police squad car.</p>

<p>The criminals opened fire on the cop car to distract them from the car the police had originally intended to pull over. Having seen a man strong-arm a pregnant woman into a car, the police had signaled them to pull over, not knowing they were really trafficking drugs. To get the heat off the drug mules, the other car opened fire and led the police away. One of the shooters died while waiting on an ambulance, while two others were killed at the scene. One died in an alley, having thrown his gun onto a roof, only to have it slide back down into his hand and thus appear armed to the police.</p>

<p>One shooter got away, and did indeed kill the young boy for his bicycle to get away.</p>

<p>The final answer is that Jim Brass shot officer Bell. During the fire fight, both men stood up. Bell was hit in the chest, but had on body armor. The shot turned him and Brass, who was shooting across Bell&rsquo;s car (in violation of protocol) accidently hit Bell.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Early in the episode, Sofia Curtis comes to unburden herself to Grissom, who repeatedly asks her not to tell him. Sofia is on administrative leave and shouldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone on the force, which is hard since most of her friends are cops, including her mother. As Sofia talks over Grissom&rsquo;s objections, Sara arrives and reinforces Grissom&rsquo;s statement of how Sofia shouldn&rsquo;t be there, talking to them. Sofia spits back that Sara doesn&rsquo;t have many friends outside the force, and Sara offers the name of a police psychologist.</p>

<p>While hunting for the bullet that killed Bell in the alley, Grissom swoops by and asks Sara to work with him, saying it&rsquo;ll be fun. Sara goes along, and seems only mildly annoyed by Grissom&rsquo;s normal quiz and games attitude. Based on the information that there was red clay on the gun of the shooter killed in the alley, and eye-witnesses claimed he&rsquo;d been unarmed while the cops said otherwise, Grissom reconstruced the situation. Sara demonstrates how the shooter threw the gun up and how he caught it when the gun slid back down.</p>

<p>Finally, Sara and Nick assist Grissom in reconstructing the shooting of Bell, using lasers and dummies. Sara, taking Sofia&rsquo;s position, easily determines the cars would have made it unable for Sofia to have killed Bell. The bullet she found in the candle in the previous episode was the deadly bullet, and only a shot from Brass&rsquo; position would have caused such a shot.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara seems rather curt with Sofia when she finds her talking with Grissom after she&rsquo;s been suspended.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:531c327cb2446516fba8c6e44562aad6">Quotes</h2>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Sofia? You&rsquo;re on administrative leave.<br />
<strong>Curtis:</strong> I know.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> You should not be in this building.<br />
<strong>Curtis:</strong> I was just talking to a friend. If I can&rsquo;t talk to a friend, who the hell am I supposed to talk to?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> Any friend outside the department.<br />
<strong>Curtis:</strong> And how many friends outside of work do you have, Sara? Maybe I should go talk to my mother. Oh, no, sorry. I forgot. She&rsquo;s a cop, too.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> I can recommend a departmental psychologist.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:fe69705294ebda92f2271fe1f9fdeb8d">Synopsis</h2>

<p>In a two-part case that highlights the possible ways for a community to be divided over a shooting, the CSIs find themselves in the unenviable position of having to be neutral parties between the police and the citizens they protect.</p>

<p>A routine traffic stop is interrupted by a high speed car chase, and Sofia Curtis and Jim Brass join the uniforms in the pursuit. The criminals are armed with automatic rifles and nine-millimeters, and are firing on the police vehicles from the start. The cops give chase for 20 blocks, one car taking 78 bullets, before the chase went to foot. The rookie cop was shot and killed, and the others take little mercy in hunting down the four criminals. Three are shot and eventually die, while one gets away, shooting a teenager to take his bike.</p>

<p>The CSIs arrive and split up the scenes. Catherine takes Brass and Sofia&rsquo;s guns, and stays with them for their interview and processing. Grissom and Warrick take the alleys. Nick and Sara take the cars. Greg takes the 20 blocks of chase scene.</p>

<p>Brass gives a fairly clear recount of what happened, staying calm and as coherent as he can. Sofia, on the other hand, is scattered, distracted, and obviously discombobulated. Her story is choppy and she can not clearly remember the entire situation.</p>

<p>Nick, who speaks fluent Spanish, is surprised when the locals claim the criminals were shot in the back. Sara, who speaks no Spanish, processes a house shot in the crossfire, and is accosted by a woman who wants to know why this happened near her children. The entire community seems more in arms about the cops treatment of the criminals and the shot (and eventually dead) teenager, than the facts that a police officer is also dead and the criminals had long rap sheets. The mother of one of the dead criminals shouts at Warrick, and her other son punches him, though charges are not pressed.</p>

<p>While all this rankles the police, the evidence does not lie, and matters will only get worse as it appears the dead cop was shot by friendly fire.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:fe69705294ebda92f2271fe1f9fdeb8d">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Seen primarily in the scene with the Spanish speaking mother, Sara is obviously shaken and uneasy when asked to explain how something like this could happen. She has no answer when the daughter translates, asking why someone shot their house. No translation is needed when the mother cries and hugs her children, wanting answers that have no questions. While Sara continues to work on the case, she obviously takes the question hard.</p>
