<h2 id="synopsis:60147c54580d6a52109ce11790100af5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two cases, both surrounded by secrets and lies. Or at least flies.</p>

<p>Catherine runs with the main case, of a woman, Christina Adalian, found dead in front of her baby, Joey, by her sister. While the scene appears to be a suicide, there&rsquo;s no blood spatter on Christina&rsquo;s hand. Another catch is that she&rsquo;s still a virgin and had the baby via Cesarean. Doc Robbins initially suspects frottage, but Sara digs up news that Christina was affiliated with Project Sunflower. Project Sunflower rescued leftover, or &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo;, embryos from in-vitro fertilization and match them up with willing parents, working on the belief that life begins at conception. Catherine disagrees with this, and the &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo; of the Project complains about her.</p>

<p>The gun is a lost cause, as if belonged to a lawyer who gave it to his paralegal, who became an EMT and lost it in a poker game to a guy with a mole between his eyes. The suicide note is analyzed and determined to be written under duress, confirming the evidence. Christina&rsquo;s will mandates that Joey be given to Dan and Kenli Johnson, who just happened to be the bio-parents of Joey. Dan is dead, and Kenli lives with her mother, Mrs. Walkey. GSR is found in their laundry, but it&rsquo;s on a size 12 shirt that belongs to Mrs. Walkey. Under questioning, and after her purse produces a picture of her husband with a mole between his eyes, she confesses. She killed Christina so that Kenli could have &lsquo;her&rsquo; child back.</p>

<p>Grissom, who is late with evaluations again, is pulled off the main case by Conrad Ecklie and the sheriff to help with a case gone to trial. It was the recent murder of the sheriff&rsquo;s god-daughter, and the defense has brought in expert etymologist, Mark Thayer, to prove she died when the suspected killer was out of town. Perhaps more to spike Thayer than help Ecklie, Grissom agrees to work on the case. Thayer presents documentation and a surprise video of an experiment proving his point. Grissom is stymied for a long time, but manages to determine Thayer doctored his pig in the experiment, forcing the flies to grow at a slower rate. Thayer&rsquo;s work is worthless and he is arrested.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:60147c54580d6a52109ce11790100af5">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Perhaps unexpectedly, Sara doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of emotional investment in this cast, offering no opinion on in vitro fertilization or conception. She seems content to go with the status quo, even when Catherine flies off the handle a bit, sitting quietly while Catherine vents at the head of Project Sunflower. Sara also displays her research skills, digging up both information on Project Sunflower and the Johnsons. At the initial scene, Sara and Catherine quickly realize that it is not a suicide, but rather a murder. She compliments the tech in QD (Questionable Documents), an older, bearded man. Sara informs Catherine of the biological parents and the victim&rsquo;s will, and together they visit the biological mother and her mother. Sara later finds blood on the biological grandmother&rsquo;s blouse.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Told with the whispery voice-over of a little girl, Nick, Sara, Warrick and Greg delve into the tale of what appears to be a quadruple homicide with no bodies. The McBride family (mother, father, son and daughter) live a quiet life and are known in their community. When the local doctor calls in a 911 call, spotting blood on the floor, the local police are stunned at the amount of blood in the house. The CSIs determine (with Catherine&rsquo;s help in the lab) that the parents and the son were shot and thus caused the blood in the house, however of the youngest, daughter Cassie, there is only a shoe full of cough syrup.</p>

<p>The CSIs investigate the house, which has been ripped apart but nothing appeared to be stolen. In the basement, they find an indoor marijuana farm. Much of the dried pot was stolen. They also learn that the son was another entrepreneur, selling essays to the other kids in his grade. One of the prints matches a kid in ROTC, who turns out to have the pot in his car&rsquo;s trunk. The son told his classmates about the pot in order to be thought of as cool, but when they came over, his parents were still there. The three teenage boys shot the son and the father, and then the mother when she came down stairs.</p>

<p>One of the boys was sent to drug the daughter, but she poured the cough syrup into her shoe and faked it, dropping &lsquo;cubes&rsquo; of [<a href="http://www.bubblicious.com/">http://www.bubblicious.com/</a> Bubblicious] gum as a Gum Drop trail. The boys then took the family out on a boat and dumped them in the middle of the nearby lake. One of the boys didn&rsquo;t want to dump Cassie, as she wasn&rsquo;t dead, and another boy slit her throat.</p>

<p>Cassie, however, was alive and managed to swim to shore, where she was found by Nick and thus able to speak (in whispers) and give us the voice-over for the episode.</p>

<h2 id="notes:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">=Notes=</h2>

<p>As originally written, the team was supposed to spend the night at a hotel since they were so far out of town; during the night Gil Grissom (unable to sleep because of Greg&rsquo;s snoring) goes to Sara&rsquo;s room, and she lets him in. Three scenes were originally written for this, and the first had been filmed when Billy Petersen&rsquo;s nephew died and he had to leave the set for a week. The script was re-written, and the scenes were deleted. Several weeks after the episode aired, Your Tax Dollars at Work (YTDAW) posted what they purported to be the original scenes. In a TV Guide interview in February of 2006, Jorja confirmed the setup (if not these specific scenes), saying that in the fifth episode (&lsquo;Gum Drops&rsquo;), Sara was supposed to sleep with Grissom.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara is the voice of reason and reality in this episode. When Nick blows up at a suspect, Sara gently calms him down and tells him she&rsquo;s worried about him. When Nick is too obsessive that the little girl is still alive, she reminds him of the odds.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Sara is called by Grissom (who&rsquo;s giving a lecture) to provide backup for Nick and brings Nick some coffee. She determines the crime must have happened somewhere between Friday night and Saturday morning, based on the gold stars Cassie should have received for her Saturday chores. After processing the house, Sara follows bloody footprints from the kitchen and discovers the marijuana farm in the basement. Sara also questions the doctor who called 911, pegging him correctly as being there to pick up his Mary Jane fix. It&rsquo;s Sara who finally gets the last teenager to admit to the crime, calmly asking him if he felt like man, killing a little girl.</p>

<p>Through the whole episode, Sara is solid and a good criminalist, on her top form. She tells Nick that in their job, it may not be best to hope that they find people alive. She also says that when it&rsquo;s your time to die, it&rsquo;s just your time. She remains cool and controlled throughout the case.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:9a3c9644ad365bf4bdd98ab75e83074c">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sara is very accepting of the fact that children die, which possibly reflects on her mother having killed her father.</li>
<li>Sara appears non-committal when talking with Greg about gold stars and childhood, but then finds the marijuana in the basement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> Grissom said you needed backup. I figured you needed coffee. But it looks like you took care of that.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I was really into gold stars when I was a kid.<br />
<strong>Sanders:</strong> As opposed to now?<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(frowns and walks away)</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Sidle:</strong> I hope you&rsquo;re right. But everything in our experience tells us they&rsquo;re dead, all four of them.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> Doesn&rsquo;t mean we just give up.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> No one&rsquo;s giving up. It&rsquo;s just that &hellip; you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re going to rescue a person, not recover a body. And on this job &hellip; that&rsquo;s just not usually the case.<br />
<strong>Stokes:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> I was rescued.<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> <em>(smiles)</em> It was not your day to die. When it&rsquo;s your day, it&rsquo;s your day, you know?</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:f1c23826a772c7ea58a02033ebd690e5">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A fairly straightforward case, in so far as they go. After dumping they body of Ty Bently in someone&rsquo;s yard, a dozen of unwashed cult members retreat to their compound and eleven of the twelve die by ritual suicide (spiked vodka) to ascend via the mother ship during the [<a href="http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html">http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/orionidhistory.html</a> Orionid meteor shower].</p>

<p>The cult members broke into the house by slashing the screen door, and proceeded to raid the fridge for junk food. They dumped Ty in the hard, who had numerous broken bones, and killed the dog with the same Ketamine they took later during the peak of the meteor shower. The cult was run by Joseph Diamond, who made a habit of luring impressionable young college students to his side, using sex with the woman (and possibly the men). The FBI had been keeping mild tabs on him for years, but generally he&rsquo;d drug the kids and steal their money (which they&rsquo;d written home for) and they&rsquo;d wake up broke with a hangover.</p>

<p>This time, the base was at an abandoned military observation bunker in the desert. Ty&rsquo;s ex, Emma, was a cult member, and he had recently argued with Diamond about Emma. Diamond was planning a one person, one way trip to Australia, presumably to take the act someplace new. One of the cult members, Abigail Spencer, catches on to Diamonds cut and run plan. Even though he invites her along, she sees it as a test and kills him.</p>

<p>Abigail then uses her knowledge from her former job to steal enough Ketamine to spike everyone&rsquo;s vodka and kill them. When Ty shows up to get Emma back (and call the cops on the mess), it&rsquo;s Abigail who shoves him the 80 feet down the bunker to his death, and convinces the cult to dump the body where he&rsquo;ll be found. Then she spikes the drinks and watches everyone die. Even though she wanted to join the others in rapture, she seems to realize that there is no Mother Ship, and runs away home without drinking.</p>

<p>When the cops come, however, Abigail gets scared and runs off, taking the leftover Ketamine in a last ditch attempt to kill herself. She&rsquo;s saved by Brass and LVPD, and confesses all to Grissom. After Abigail asks if Grissom believes in life &lsquo;out there,&rsquo; he tells her that if there is, they&rsquo;re smart enough to stay away from humans.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:d0c594f667db0c9c9ad9b2fc1406c725">Synopsis##</h2>

<p>A husband and wife, unhappily married, have a night alone which ends when the wife is found dead at the bottom of the stairs in a pool of blood. The case unfolds ambiguously, as the evidence points to an accident or a murder, but neither conclusively. The husband, Ray, was married before and his first wife died of a stroke, falling on the stairs; this is later proven correct by exhumation and autopsy. His recent wife, Becky, doesn&rsquo;t show the classic signs of a fall, however, which confuses the CSIs, who are being pressured by the DA for this high profile case.</p>

<p>Both Ray and Becky were having affairs &ndash; Becky with her boss and Ray was being bitten by a dentist (played by Hudson Lieck) &ndash; and Ray was being blackmailed about his. The CSIs determine it&rsquo;s Becky who&rsquo;s blackmailing her own husband, threatening to tell herself if he doesn&rsquo;t pay up. Becky was convinced Ray was hiding away money from her, and this was her plan to get it back. Ray&rsquo;s daughter, Susan, had caught onto her step-mother&rsquo;s affair, and after luring Becky into the house, beat her to death with a cane.</p>

<p>Through it all, Ray insists he slept through it, but the CSIs are quite sure he and the daughter are covering for each other. But they can&rsquo;t prove it.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:d0c594f667db0c9c9ad9b2fc1406c725">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara drives Nick and Warrick to the scene; there, she processes the stairs and is the first one to realize that the victim didn&rsquo;t fall as was reported. Sara shares an interesting scene with Grissom in the wife&rsquo;s bedroom. They discuss the reasons a couple may sleep in separate rooms (Sara saying snoring and other mundane reasons). Grissom suggests that they were suffocating each other. Sara comments on sex and romance and gives Grissom a look. Grissom walks off without commenting and they go on to find evidence in the case and move on.</p>

<p>Sara and Catherine work well together puzzling out who wrote the blackmail note. Sara&rsquo;s a little surprised to think the wife was blackmailing her husband. Sara and Greg check out the husband&rsquo;s home office, and discover a bloody fingerprint on the phone.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:d94e4c47503da49e9f7ef730c058023d">Synopsis</h2>

<p>Two cases are well tied together in this episode, aptly showing how, in the end, we all end up in the same place. The episode is filmed with a lot of split screen, allowing one case to mirror the other and to hi-light the class differences between the dead men. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the CSI&rsquo;s seem to treat each case as equally important.</p>

<p>One case is of Julian Harper, and up and coming actor who was found dead in his hotel room by his best friend, Blinky. Through the night preceding his death, Julian&rsquo;s manager (and ex-wife) found a teenaged girl for Julian to have sex with (and the manager paid the girl off to claim Julian was a gentleman), Julian had his room broken into (the thief spent two hours listening to Julian and the girl), he left another girl to Blinky for sloppy seconds, and finally died of auto-erotic asphyxiation. Blinky found him and cut him down, trying to afford Julian a little dignity in death to pay him back for being a great friend.</p>

<p>The other case is a complicated and convolution relationship of three men from Laos who all work together, hate each other and two are dead. Noy Vipraxy is found dead of a car accident. Later that same night, Samay Thao and his taxi driver are found shot by a shotgun, wielded by Noy&rsquo;s brother, Keo. Samay also has trace from Noy&rsquo;s car on his person (a bit of a broken CD in his eye). Keo insists he shot a burglar, but as the CSI&rsquo;s determine, he was possibly waiting to kill his own brother. With a red herring of the slightly unscrupulous laundry boss, who gently alters Keo&rsquo;s interview to exclude hints that the boss is shady (he&rsquo;s working multiple jobs on the sly, presumably without paying taxes, and is on the insurance plan as a beneficiary for many of his workers), Keo confesses that his brother&rsquo;s dead wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Keo brought Noy to America to raise money for the rest of their family. Instead, Noy blew their earnings. So Keo bought a shotgun, and Noy went and got killed in a car. It&rsquo;s possible that either Samay killed Noy as a favor for Keo, and Keo shot Samay to keep the money himself <em>or</em> Keo was waiting for Noy to come home and &lsquo;accidently&rsquo; shoot him, but got Samay instead, when Samay came to tell Keo about what happened to Noy.</p>

<p>In the end, rich man and poor man are in the morgue together, their lives ending the same way.</p>
