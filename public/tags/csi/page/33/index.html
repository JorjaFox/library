<p>Catherine&rsquo;s father, Sam Braun , is killed in an act of revenge for being the percieved cause of another investors suicide. Before Sam&rsquo;s death, his killers make Catherine believe she&rsquo;s been raped, and hold her daughter for ransom. Sam&rsquo;s killer is, in turn, killed by Sam&rsquo;s bodyguards.</p>

<p>Rock star Izzy Delancy has been killed by a blow to the head, and an identical miniature of the crime scene has been left behind. While everyone in the family wants to blame each other, neither Izzy&rsquo;s wife, ex-wife, son or nanny committed the crime. The case is unsolved, and Grissom stays in his office, inspecting the miniature.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:7dbc07cac5c0ced16489e37b27569666">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>While Grissom and Sara are alone at the Delancy crime scene, there&rsquo;s considerable banter between the two, continuing the level of intimacy demonstrated in the last two episodes. Even after Sara leaves the case to help Catherine, she returns to talk with Grissom on the case.</p>

<p>Conrad Ecklie asks them about releasing information on the miniature to the media, but Grissom says no. Ecklie mutters &lsquo;Of course you do&rsquo; when Sara says she agrees with Grissom. After Ecklie leaves, Sara and Grissom exchange looks, and Sara shakes her head &ndash; this may or may not imply that Ecklie is unaware of their relationship.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:7dbc07cac5c0ced16489e37b27569666">Character Notes</h2>

<p>Robert O&rsquo;Brien commits suicide at a Sam Braun&rsquo;s  party, with alprazolam in his system. Robert&rsquo;s life-partner has the bottle of pills, and the gun used is registered in his name, making him a suspect. Sesame seeds in the gun, Robert&rsquo;s mouth, Robert&rsquo;s pockets, and an oven mitt with trace GSR prove that it really was a suicide.</p>

<p>A performer at Cirque du Soleil&rsquo;s KA finds a dead body just off backstage. Celia Noel was accidently killed when sneaking backstage to see behind the scenes, and she was struck in the head by a prop.</p>

<p>Brass receives a medal of valor for being shot in &ldquo;Way to Go&rdquo;. Unhappy about the public reminder of his stupidity, Brass hides it away and goes to get a tattoo of the date he was shot, just below the scar from the bullet. After dancing at a bar with Nick, Catherine is drugged and wakes up naked in a hotel room.</p>

<p>Grissom finds an exact miniature replica of the crime scene he&rsquo;s investigating, while at the crime scene.</p>

<p>Sara works the O&rsquo;Brien case, and inquires as to how David is doing with his in laws. Sara teases Grissom in his office later, quoting him for effect. The two are quite obviously still in a relationship. While Sara&rsquo;s working with Warrick over lunch, Grissom brings her food: a veggie burger.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:73020fd757d025937c056192fb2e76c0">Synopsis</h2>

<p>The episode opens where &ldquo;Bang-Bang&rdquo; left off. Brass has been shot and is being rushed by the EMTs to the hospital. His blood pressure is dangerously low and Brass flatlines on the table. The doctors bring him back, and Brass hallucinates, remembering when he asked Grissom to be his emergency contact and to have power of attorney in case something happens, because there&rsquo;s no one he trusts more with his life or death. Grissom is informed he may have to make a choice soon about what to do.</p>

<p>Before that can happen, Grissom is called away for a dead body on the train tracks near Henderson. The body is an apparent decapitaion by the train. Grissom finds a bad toupee, and David (the coroner) opens the body&rsquo;s shirt to find that the waist has been shaped into a perfect hourglass.</p>

<p>Catherine and Warrick find a man dead in his apartment after a long night of partying. There was a cake, drugs and alcohol all over the apartment, but the body is only a few hours dead. Catherine finds a mirror with blood on it.</p>

<p>Nick finds the head to the decapitated body in a stream a ways from where the body was found. Doc Robbins explains that the body shape was done intentionally over a long period of time. The cause of death was a very large caliber bullet shot, not decapitation. Hodges says that white cream on the decapitated body was cortizone cream, for an itch, and the fibers indicated the clothes were vintage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brass&rsquo; condition is still critical. He may need surgery to remove the bullet, but either way it&rsquo;s not good for Brass&rsquo; long term odds. Grissom weighs the risks and approves the surgery and contacts Ellie, Brass&rsquo; daughter to come to Vegas.</p>

<p>The party-boy was filled with drugs and booze to the gills. It if was illegal, he was into it. The mirror&rsquo;s blood matches a hooker who&rsquo;d been arrested after a trick roll. The hooker&rsquo;s DNA also matches the pubic hairs found all over the dead body.</p>

<p>Greg has taken over watching Brass, and asks Grissom about Brass and Grissom&rsquo;s relationship. Grissom attests to the fact that they don&rsquo;t hang out, but is distracted when Ellie arrives and is her usuall abrasive self.</p>

<p>Sara stops by Grissom&rsquo;s office asks if he&rsquo;s okay. Grissom is looking at a magazine about the use of a corset for men. Sara takes the photo of man to a corset shop, who identifies the body as Caleb Carson, a real mans man. Sara and Sofia go to Caleb&rsquo;s house, where he&rsquo;s shown to be an intense Civil War buff. His ancestor, Colonel Caleb C.C. Carson, is prominent in the collection, as are large caliber, old style pistols.</p>

<p>Grissom comes and inspects Caleb&rsquo;s diorama, while Warrick waits with Brass. The surgery was just completed and they removed the bullet, but Brass was still unconscious. Sofia reveals her father was a Civil War buff. Sara prints the corset Carson wore, because it laces in the back and he&rsquo;d have to have had someone to help him. Corset wearing also ran in the family, as Colonel Carson also wore one.</p>

<p>Warrick and Ellie talk. Brass never talks much about her.</p>

<p>The hooker from the party-boy, aka Manny Rupert, says that she earned the $10,000 and that Manny had wanted more sex after six go-arounds, and shot at her when she bailed. Catherine points out the hooker isn&rsquo;t a $10-G a night girl. Manny&rsquo;s official cause of death is diabetic shock.</p>

<p>Caleb Carson&rsquo;s driver and dresser is brought in, his prints matching those found on the corset. He is stunned to learn about Caleb&rsquo;s death. Caleb was last seen at a duel at Gettysburg: a reenactment site outside of Las Vegas. Caleb and a Northern soldier got into a tiff at the reenactment (over the Northern soldier using his cell phone during a reenactment). They dueled, but Caleb used real bullets.</p>

<p>Grissom and Sara reenact the duel with cameras. The blood matches the Northerners story, but they also find what may be the location of Caleb&rsquo;s decapitation. The Northerners gun is found to be unable to have killed Caleb, because it was configured to only shoot black smoke.</p>

<p>Manny&rsquo;s sister says he was just diagnosed as a pre diabetic. He&rsquo;d just turned 40 and had acted like it was a death sentence. Warrick is less than sympathetic.</p>

<p>Caleb&rsquo;s blood is that of the second pool by the train. The hair fibers are a toupee, however. The toupee matches his driver/dresser, who confesses that after Caleb shot the Northerner, he and Caleb wrestled for the pistol, accidentally killing Caleb. The driver staged the body on the tracks, to pay homage to how Colonel Carson died, standing on the tracks, shooting at a Yankee train until it ran him over.</p>

<p>Nick keeps an eye on Ellie, which may be good, because she calls the payroll asking about Brass&rsquo; pension. Ellie is brought to Brass&rsquo;s office, where she sits and sees pictures of her as a child. But she says it&rsquo;s easier to love a child than an adult. At the hospital, Catherine stands vigil over Brass. Lindsey, her daughter, calls, upset about Catherine not being home. As Catherine hangs up, Brass has small emergency where he&rsquo;s not getting enough oxygen. After he&rsquo;s helped, he wakes up and reaches for Ellie, who runs off.</p>

<p>When Brass finally wakes up completely, he sees all the CSI&rsquo;s outside the room, happy to find him alive.</p>

<p>Grissom, in a bedroom, talks about how he&rsquo;d like to know before he dies. He&rsquo;d like the time to say goodbye and do the things he&rsquo;d never been able to do before. As he talks, Sara comes out of the bathroom, with damp hair, in a bathrobe and says she&rsquo;s not ready to say goodbye yet. Grissom smiles.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:73020fd757d025937c056192fb2e76c0">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara spends most of her time working on the corset angle of the Carson case. When Brass wakes up, Sara cries and hugs Warrick and Nick, who are standing beside her. As the episode ends, Grissom and Sara are shown togeather, in a bedroom, both wearing bathrobes and quite obviously in a relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know. Most people want to die in their sleep, I suppose. Never know that it&rsquo;s happening, like a crime scene. Surprise, you&rsquo;re dead. I&rsquo;d prefer to know in advance that I was going to die. I&rsquo;d like to be diagnosed with cancer actually, have some time to prepare. Go back to the rain forest one more time, re-read &lsquo;Moby Dick.&rsquo; Possibly enter an international chess tournament. At least have enough time to say &lsquo;goodbye&rsquo; to the ones that I love.<br />

<h2 id="synopsis:a020ddd791ce6cebb3e83d03a8c2fd58">Synopsis</h2>

<p>It starts out in a casino with a guard having his gun stolen and a guest shoots him with it. The shooter takes a hostage and the casino calls in the SWAT team. Jim Brass arrives with SWAT as the negotiator. Once the floor is cleared, they try and open the door. The shooter shoots through the door and we flash back to 15 hours before.</p>

<p>Brass, Grissom, Warrick, David and Doc Robbins are on the scene of a domestic homicide case, where the wife (Janice Cutler) was shot in the face. There is no other signs of a struggle in the room, and Grissom is suspicious. There was signs of sex, but not rape, in the body. The gun was placed inside the mouth. Grissom admits he was only close to marriage when he was seven.</p>

<p>Sara and Warrick inspect the house. Warrick laments he and Tina got married so fast. Warrick finds light porn in the house. The gardener&rsquo;s sock was found in the bedroom, and the young man, Timmy, admits that he&rsquo;d been having an affair with Janice. Timmy says that her husband, Willie, was in a rage, but both were alive when he left.</p>

<p>The prints on the porn match the husband, and Nick calls one of the numbers. Sally, the hooker, says that she&rsquo;d been screwing around with Willie, and he&rsquo;d given her his card. Catherine goes to Willie&rsquo;s office, where a man is found dead on the floor. Another body is dead in the back office, and one man is alive in the back office: Willie Cutler. Willie had no idea his wife was dead.</p>

<p>At the second scene, the bullets trajectory confirm Willie&rsquo;s story. Willy also claims to have not known Janice was sleeping with Timmy. Willie&rsquo;s story has a few holes, however, as he claims to have lost money at the tables, rather than spending it with Sally and so on. The CSI&rsquo;s verify this as the taxi driver who picked up &lsquo;Sammy&rsquo; had the fare recorded, and it was Willie.</p>

<p>Willie, however, has an older brother, named Sammy, who just got out of prison for grand theft auto. Sammy had ditched his taxi ride to the Lucky Dragon, wanting to go to a casino, so Warrick takes the information to the casino. At the casino, Warrick sees his wife, who lies about where she is. They argue, and Warrick tells her to leave, presuming she&rsquo;s cheating on him, when in reality she was planning his birthday party.</p>

<p>Doc Robbins comes to give Sara the autopsy reports, and says that Willie&rsquo;s &lsquo;gunshot&rsquo; wound was actually done by a sharp object that left a blue trail. Like a pen. Willie&rsquo;s shirt is clean of GSR, and it becomes apparent he stabbed himself with a ball-point pen to make it look like he was shot. Grissom finds traces of Janice&rsquo;s blood on Willie&rsquo;s shirt and tells Brass to get Willie. They suspect the brothers were in on it together.</p>

<p>Willie arrives at the casino, takes the guard&rsquo;s gun, shoots him, takes a woman hostage, and takes the elevator upstairs, bringing us back to where we were in the beginning.</p>

<p>Willie takes a very long time to answer the phone when Brass calls, wanting to come in and talk. Brass is unarmed, and Willie lets him in. Willie says that Sammy was trying to help him, and Brass says he&rsquo;ll trade Sammy for hostage. The catch being that the CSI&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t actually have Sammy.</p>

<p>Willie confesses that he&rsquo;d blown the $5000 on a hooker, thinking he&rsquo;d be getting a a $15,000 promotion. But Willie was passed over and then wired himself $50K, all his money. Willie took the money to the Lucky Dragon, so he tried to win big, but it all went south. When Willie got home and confessed to his wife, she insulted him, and Sammy shot her. Willie decided to use his money to get Sammy safe. He went to the office and found his co-workers dead, and realized that his brother did it to protect him.</p>

<p>The kicker is that Sammy died a month ago. Brass calls out the safe word, Willie shoots him, and the SWAT team kills Willie.</p>

<h2 id="synopsis:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Synopsis</h2>

<p>A well-to-do man is found dead, far from his hotel, in fancy, party clothes. He was on a scripted night of fantasy and entertainment, which included hustling people at pool, being chased in a high speed car race, and getting the beautiful girl. What was not a part of the script is his death.</p>

<p>The team follows the victim via hotel surveillance, discovering who he was with and where he went; a banged-up Ferarri gives them more clues. As part of his vacation, his boss set him up with a &lsquo;fantasy fulfillment&rsquo; service, one which checks a client&rsquo;s background to reveal their secret desires, then crafts a fantasy based on those desires. Normally the service is used by marketers and advertisers, to create a climate in which people will be more relaxed and more inclined to buy their products or services.</p>

<p>In the end, the high-roller dies because he can&rsquo;t tell the difference between fantasy and reality, and gets a fatal beating from the bodyguards of a rich Korean gambler.</p>

<h2 id="sara-sidle-review:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Sara Sidle Review</h2>

<p>Sara is her usual investigative self in this, trading barbs with Greg as they strip a car, and tracing cell phones via computer. There are, however, unspoken vibes in the air. At the end, when the team is putting together the final clues of the puzzle, the talk turns to fantasies &ndash; several times during this she and Grissom exchange glances, leaving us to wonder what their fantasies might be like.</p>

<p>Spoilers made much of the scene between Grissom, Sara and Caprice (the man running the fantasy fulfillment service), and how his insight would reveal an aspect of Grissom and Sara&rsquo;s &lsquo;relationship.&rsquo; In truth, the scene was tame and while both Grissom and Sara stole looks at each other, nothing overt was brought up. It was obvious Sara still has feelings for Grissom, and it appears Grissom may still harbor affection, but nothing is definitive.</p>

<h2 id="character-notes:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Character Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>As has been noted before, Sara seems most comfortable working with Greg, trading quips and jokes with him.<br /></li>
<li>Sara obviously has her fantasies, but we will probably never know what they are &ndash; other than the fact that they likely involve Grissom.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quotes:27a9bef930e919dc0a2cf6f2f4cbfbec">Quotes</h2>

<p>Sara Please tell me there are something more to this guys and cars thing, besides the obvious penis extension metaphors.<br />
<strong>Greg:</strong> So you want me to lie?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Grissom:</strong> Some guys are intimidated by beauty. Or fear rejection. _<br />
<strong>Sidle:</strong> _(narrows her eyes in reaction to this__</p>
