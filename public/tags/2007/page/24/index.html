		<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &ldquo;(on Billy Petersen leaving the show for four weeks in November of 2006)&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed at all, I think, you know, obviously as I met Billy he had come almost directly out of this excitement of theater he was doing in Chicago and he&rsquo;s very famous for that theater that he&rsquo;s done. I think that it&rsquo;s been the heart of his work over the time of his career, he&rsquo;s done some films that are ground-breaking and memorable and everybody, those, that&rsquo;s probably the way that the most people know Billy Petersen, but I think that people who know Billy Petersen &ldquo;know&rdquo; that his heart and his soul has always been in the theater, so, and it&rsquo;s almost as if in a sense odd that it took him six years to find his way into one, you know, and I think that it&rsquo;s a testament to the show, how much &ldquo;CSI:&rdquo; has all this passion that he hasn&rsquo;t felt like he could go do a play at the same time. Cause he&rsquo;s also fairly multi-faceted, much more so than I am and I think some of us are on the show.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> From the very beginning of the inception of my character coming on to the pro- the show of &ldquo;CSI:&rdquo; and them deciding to add this character, there&rsquo;s this little piece of paper that you get when you go to audition for these roles, and, and , I think the first sentence said &#8216;love interest for Grissom&rsquo;. So from like day one of me kind of going for the audition this was a story that hung there in the ethers and then, you know, as we started to go into season 1 and season 2 and started to realize that we were going to have a season 3 I think there was interest on everybody&rsquo;s part not to, so to speak, &#8216;blow our wad&rsquo; too soon, you know &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo;. You tell this story then where do you go from there and it could be, you know, if we were lucky enough which it &ldquo;seemed&rdquo; might be happening, there&rsquo;d be years of awkwardness after the break-up or stuff that you know &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo; we didn&rsquo;t want to play for three seasons. So I think that it, it was kind of wise to hold back on it and, and then we got to a point where we thought that maybe the fans were not interested in it any more.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> &ldquo;(voiceover)&rdquo; We&rsquo;d already begun shooting the last episode of season 6, the script had been out, there was an ending set, and I got a call from Carol Mendelsohn suggesting &lsquo;hey, what do you think about this and would you want to do this&rsquo; and is this interesting to you. Which is also something that&rsquo;s great about this show and I think very unique is I don&rsquo;t know how often actors get those calls. I was shocked, very surprised, and, and, and very very intrigued. I thought it could make season 7 extremely interesting for my character and certainly a storyline that I had always been gearing up to play and wanted to play, and I&rsquo;ve always loved the dynamic between Grissom and Sara, I love that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;little&rdquo; bit sort of scandalous, it&rsquo;s untraditional in, in a couple of respects, and I love those kinds of love stories. So&hellip; I was thrilled.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox</strong> It&rsquo;s a complete and utter shock and surprise. First of all I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been seven years. One of the reasons I &ldquo;hate&rdquo; doing interviews like this is &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m reminded that it&rsquo;s been seven years, &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t feel like seven years. It&rsquo;s like &#8216;yeah, a couple of years&rsquo;, you know, it&rsquo;s the coolest thing ever, I never could have even wished for this, to be a part of a show this long and never would have expected that it would ever happen and I can&rsquo;t believe that it has, in many respects, we still have a gazillion cool stories left to tell. So&hellip; yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty weird.</p>

<p>While cast and crew remain tight-lipped on the details, we can reveal that the violent outcome has a major bearing on another of the show&rsquo;s most intriguing storylines &#8212; the clandestine relationship between Grissom and his fiesty colleague Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox).</p>

<p>As the CSI team tries to track down the killer, Sara goes missing and her secret relationship with Grissom is forced into the open.</p>

<p>Whether Sara becomes another victim of the mini-replica killer remains to be seen, especially in the light of speculation over Jorja Fox&rsquo;s future on the show. After seven years playing Sara, the actress is still in negotiations with producers over her contract following a pay dispute that reportedly saw her walking out during the filming of the finale.</p>

<p>So will this be the last we see of the sparky investigator? &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s going to have to tune into the next series to see what happens to her, as she&rsquo;s left in a bit of a bind,&rdquo; reveals Fox, who was dismissed over another salary dispute in 2004 before being rehired. &ldquo;All I can say is they don&rsquo;t call it a cliffhanger for nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="question-about-sara-sidle:96990fdf109e5ed65581baa4fbe9ab8e">Question - about Sara Sidle(?)</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Uh, yes, well I think that Marg and I feel very very lucky to play the women we get to play on TV, you know. The character I get to play is &ldquo;so&rdquo; much smarter than I am, number one, &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo; which is really fun, you never get tired of doing that, and they&rsquo;re just, you know they&rsquo;re strong women, and they&rsquo;re professional, they&rsquo;re completely intellectual and at the same time they feel very real, they feel like real people to me, they don&rsquo;t feel, feels like a person that somebody could actually be. You know sometimes you see movies and television, which is very entertaining, but it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s sort of someone who is very, you know, the superhero or the perfect beautiful person and the life that they get to lead, and I think that Marg and I get to play people that regular people can identify with, they say &ldquo;Oh, I could be that person&rdquo; or &ldquo;I could do that&rdquo;. Uh, that&rsquo;s a really wonderful thing to get to do.</p>

<h2 id="question-about-fan-mail:96990fdf109e5ed65581baa4fbe9ab8e">Question - about fan mail</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> From time to time, yes, and from Japan, I&rsquo;ve definitely received letters from Japan, which is really very wonderful. Um, I get a lot of letters from teenagers which is really nice. I think that when we started the show I thought we were going to get a lot of mail from jail, from prisoners &ldquo;(laughs)&rdquo;, and mail sort of, I don&rsquo;t know, I thought the mail would be more eccentric than it&rsquo;s been. It&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been really nice, supportive, very sort of sane fan mail. Which I would have never expected.</p>

<h2 id="question-about-the-best-episode:96990fdf109e5ed65581baa4fbe9ab8e">Question - about the best episode(?)</h2>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Uh, &ldquo;A Bullet Runs Through It&rdquo;, and I believe they&rsquo;re from season six, and they&rsquo;re actually a two-parter episode, and there&rsquo;s a, a, an incident that happens in a low income neighborhood in Los Vegas and the cops swoop down on the event, and everyone&rsquo;s got a different visual idea of what they think happened. So the community is very angry at the police, the police are very angry at the community, and we spend, uh, two episodes almost finding out actually what happened at the crime. And um, I feel that it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a very timely episode, at least for us in America, I think this kind of thing happens a lot, there&rsquo;s a lot of distrust of police and authorities, a lot of people feel very disenfranchised, and of course we had Hurricane Katrina here last year, and there were a lot of citizens that felt like, uh, the people that are supposed to protect them really let them down, or never showed up, and um, and uh I also think that we live in a time where there&rsquo;s a lot of escalation of fear, and, and the idea that uh, you know, people are afraid of things, some of them rational, some aren&rsquo;t rational, and I think that people, at least in America, there&rsquo;s a very split situation happening politically, with a lot of people - we&rsquo;re talking about millions and millions of people - and, and they have very short tempers right now. So rather than sitting down and talking things through, they&rsquo;re leaping to anger very quickly and leaping to violence very quickly and, and that episode for me, has a lot of those issues and ideas in it, and I thought it was really beautifully written and kind of gutsy, we don&rsquo;t tell a lot of stories, we don&rsquo;t put a lot of moral, moral feelings into a lot of our stories, we sort of just tell a story and let people decide for themselves. And this one I think the writers couldn&rsquo;t help a little bit, they just put a little bit a sense of themselves into it, and that&rsquo;s sort of a brave way that I really liked a lot. &ldquo;(listens to translator)&rdquo; Yeah, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s really good. I think, you know, we&rsquo;ll see what happens in season seven but I think the most powerful episode to date&rsquo;s been that one.</p>

<p>##Question - about Sara and Grissom</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(laughing)&rdquo; Sara and Grissom. Well you know Sara, coming into season five, kind of decided that she&rsquo;s not going to chase Grissom any more. I think she finally recognized after almost three, four years of chasing him around, and he&rsquo;s turned her down, and he&rsquo;s said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to dates several times, she&rsquo;s decided that she&rsquo;s gonna try and move on, you know, and of course we all know that the ones that get away are sort of the ones that are definitely the hardest to forget and hardest to, to do that with. So, there&rsquo;s a bit of a struggle there, um, you know she&rsquo;s just trying, she&rsquo;s just trying to move on.</p>

<p>###Question - about William Petersen</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> Uh, I think he&rsquo;ll be, ah, really overjoyed. He&rsquo;s incredibly charming, and, and wonderful, he&rsquo;s an amazing listener, creatively I think he&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant. When he, uh, started with &ldquo;CSI&rdquo; he had come from a theater background in Chicago, Illinois in the States and the only way that he really knows how to work is collectively and communally and where people develop ideas together, the stories together, and um he had kind of said to everyone at CBS, the writers, that, that&rsquo;s the way this show would have to be or else he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to work in this environ-, in that environment and so from the very beginning we had a very collective show, and it&rsquo;s pretty rare on television. And um, and the writers get together and they have think tanks and they break stories together and they work on stories together and even when sometimes, when the story gets to the set the writer, the actors, the director might still be discussing it, they might make changes on the set, and so it really makes working really fun and interesting, and also you have to stay on your toes because things you think are happening may not happen the way that you thought when you got to work. And, and he really brings that spirit to the set and everyone has, he listens to everyone, everyone has an opinion and they&rsquo;ve got values and he&rsquo;s funny. He&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s, you know, obviously he&rsquo;s my most favorite scene partner I&rsquo;ve ever had and, um it&rsquo;s been really exciting to, to take this journey not only with everyone but specifically with him. And um, I think both he and I feel very very invested in the characters and we&rsquo;re wishing that our characters at some point &ldquo;way&rdquo; down the road have a happy ending somewhere, whatever that looks like.</p>

<p>##Question - Billy Petersen vs. Gil Grissom</p>

<p><strong>Jorja Fox:</strong> &ldquo;(smiling)&rdquo; Yeah, absolutely. &ldquo;(listening to off-camera question)&rdquo; Mmmm-hmmm. Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely, and it does, it&rsquo;s the same. And he&rsquo;ll tell you that he has absolutely nothing at all in common with Grissom, and ah, some of us know that that&rsquo;s &ldquo;(laughing)&rdquo; not entirely true. Um, but yeah, just the professionalism, and, and the focus, he&rsquo;s tireless. You know, we would work, you know, many many many long hours, and especially in maybe our first three or four seasons of the show in almost every scene, no matter how tired he was, and, and how far into the season we were he would come into work and give 150%. And I think that also, everybody around him is very contagious, you know, to someone that has that kind of enthusiasm. Um, yeah, he&rsquo;s calm and very forgiving, you know, Grissom is certainly, and the other thing that&rsquo;s great about Grissom is he&rsquo;s always busy doing what he&rsquo;s doing, so he&rsquo;s not paying &ldquo;too&rdquo; much attention on the rest of us, we really get to go out and solve our own crimes, and, and that&rsquo;s cool too.</p>
